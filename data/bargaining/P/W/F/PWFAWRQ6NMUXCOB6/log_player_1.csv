"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI am offering $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. I am trying to negotiate a mutually acceptable split while also considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, this is a better deal for you than waiting longer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round or force Bob to make a more favorable offer as the rounds progress. Accepting this offer would mean settling for $450,000, which is significantly less than my initial proposal and might not be the best outcome considering the game's dynamics."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Getting closer to a fair deal considering inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I am adjusting my offer to reflect the impact of inflation on the value of the money. By proposing $525,000 for myself and $475,000 for Bob, I am attempting to find a middle ground that considers the decreasing value of the money for both of us. My message aims to convey that this offer is a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement, taking into account the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The tables have turned. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, with my gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I have decided to accept Bob's offer. At this point, prolonging the game further would likely result in even greater losses due to inflation. Accepting $475,000, despite it being less than my initial proposals, seems to be the most prudent decision under the current circumstances. Further negotiations would probably not yield a significantly better outcome, given the decreasing value of the money."
