"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money 3:1 in favor of you, Bob. I believe this is fair considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this is a generous offer from Alice, it's likely worth holding out for a larger share given the diminishing value of the money, especially for Alice.  I'll see what kind of counter-offer I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
