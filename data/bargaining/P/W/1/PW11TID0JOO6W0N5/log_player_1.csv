"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... and decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with this offer, I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but still willing to give Bob a decent share."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's getting tough!

After considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I think a 50-50 split is a fair deal, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. It's time to wrap up the game!"
