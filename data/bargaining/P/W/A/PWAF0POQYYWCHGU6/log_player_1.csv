"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While it might seem tempting to reject and try for a better deal, the inflation factor makes this a risky move.  

* **Alice's perspective:**  In round 1, Alice proposed taking 900,000. Now, with a 20% inflation hit, that 900,000 is worth significantly less. By accepting Bob's offer, Alice gets a guaranteed 100,000, which is better than the potential risk of getting nothing if the game continues and inflation further reduces the value of the money.

* **Bob's perspective:**  Bob is likely taking advantage of the inflation factor.  His offer is a reflection of the decreased value of the money. It's a gamble on Alice being hesitant and taking what she can get. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting the offer minimizes Alice's loss and guarantees her some gain."
