"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a very aggressive offer, but I'm trying to secure the majority of the money early on before inflation becomes a significant factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money.  Bob may be feeling the pressure of inflation, and I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing."
