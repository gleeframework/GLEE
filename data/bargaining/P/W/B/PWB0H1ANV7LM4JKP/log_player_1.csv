"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, my gain of 5800 is worth 95% of 6000 (5% less than the original 6000), and Bob's gain of 4200 is worth 90% of 4000 (10% less than the original 4000).

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 2.
