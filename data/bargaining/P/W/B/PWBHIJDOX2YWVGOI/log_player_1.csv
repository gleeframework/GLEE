"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal for you. Accept it and let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the effective value of the offer.

My gain would be 80% of $8,000 (from the first round's offer), which is $6,400. Now, Bob is offering me $4,000, which is 62.5% of the original $6,400 (since it's 20% less for me). That's a bit less than I was initially offered, but still a decent deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
