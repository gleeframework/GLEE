"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I think 60/40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With inflation, the money is worth less for both of us, but more so for Alice. I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 55/45 is more than fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is affecting us both, and it's the fairest way forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Alice, I believe accepting this 50/50 split is the best decision. The offer is fair, and further rounds would only continue to devalue the money, likely leading to a worse outcome for both of us."
