"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. I want to secure a larger share in the first round, as inflation will quickly devalue the money in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking further inflation. Accepting secures a fair share, even if the money is worth less than in the first round."
