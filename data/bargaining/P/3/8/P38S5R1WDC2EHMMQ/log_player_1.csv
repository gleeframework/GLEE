"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, giving me $700,000 and Bob $300,000. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more cautious with my decision now.

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my proposed gain of $700,000 in the first round is now equivalent to $560,000 in terms of purchasing power. Bob's offer of $600,000 is a significant concession, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer now.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, Bob. I need more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, giving me $550,000 and Bob $450,000. My message is a bit more assertive, emphasizing the need for a better deal due to the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I still think I deserve a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my proposed gain of $700,000 is now equivalent to approximately $362,000 in terms of purchasing power. Bob's offer of $500,000 is a good compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair middle ground and I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.
