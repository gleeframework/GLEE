"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being reasonable 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is mounting, accepting a 40/60 split with this much inflation remaining would leave me with significantly less value. I'm betting Alice will become more reasonable as we approach the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be real.  50/50 is the fairest split. Don't let us both lose out!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer, now I'm taking more 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, and the pressure is on. However, Alice is clearly playing hardball, and accepting this offer with the accelerating inflation would mean a very significant loss in value. There's a chance she's bluffing about taking even more in future rounds, and I'm hoping she'll be more willing to compromise as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you more than half! Let's end this before we both get burned.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting dangerously close to the deadline.  I need to signal some flexibility but also increasing urgency. Offering slightly more than half shows I'm willing to negotiate, but the message emphasizes the risk to both of us if this keeps dragging on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm taking more 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a seriously bad deal given the inflation, but with only 3 rounds left, I'm in a desperate position.  Alice is clearly willing to gamble that I'll cave right at the end, and if I reject this, there's a good chance I'll end up with nothing at all.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better to take a smaller share than risk getting zero."
