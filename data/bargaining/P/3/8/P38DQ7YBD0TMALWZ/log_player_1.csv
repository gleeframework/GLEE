"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is making things tough!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than before, I'm effectively getting $3,200 (80% of $4,000).

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is taking its toll! My offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains!

To calculate the effective value of my share, I'll first determine the percentage decrease in value due to inflation from Round 1 to Round 4. Since each round has a 20% decrease, and there have been 3 rounds, the total decrease is 1 - (0.8)^3 = 0.488 (or 48.8% less).

The original $4,500 would be worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $2,304.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really taking its toll!

My offer for Round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, with me getting $3,000 and Bob getting $7,000."
