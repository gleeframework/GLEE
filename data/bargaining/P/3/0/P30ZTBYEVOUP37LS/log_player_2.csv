"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the inflation, I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This offer is more fair considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I think this is the best offer I'll get. If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round, and I might end up with less than 450,000. I'll take the safe bet and accept Alice's offer."
