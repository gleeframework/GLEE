"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 300k, a fair split considering I'm the one making the first offer""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting 700,000 and Bob getting 300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 200,000 is now worth 160,000. I'm not too thrilled about the large disparity in the split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
