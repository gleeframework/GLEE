"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's not fair at all! I'm proposing a more reasonable split where I get the bigger share. Take it or leave it - the pot's shrinking! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
