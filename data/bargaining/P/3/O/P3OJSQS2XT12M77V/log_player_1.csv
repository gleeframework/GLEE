I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it quickly. I want to get the most money possible while keeping it fair enough to avoid unnecessary rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm aware that inflation is a factor, and with Bob's offer I'll still get a decent share. It's better than risking further rounds and seeing my potential gain shrink even more."
