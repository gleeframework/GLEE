"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, $250,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $200,000. And since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, $750,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $712,500.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, as I'm not getting a good deal considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to keep a smaller share to account for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""A more modest proposal, but still a fair split!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $700,000 and keeping $300,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more generous, but still a good deal for me 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, $200,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $102,400. And since the money is worth 14.26% less for Bob, $800,000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, which is $685,800.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. $102,400 is a decent amount, and I'm willing to take it considering the inflation."
