Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I believe a fairer split is closer to 55/45. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and the deal is getting worse for both of us with each round.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I need a bit more than that.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic, the value of the money is decreasing. I'm willing to go down to 52/48, but I need a fair compromise. Time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, accepting a 48/52 split at this stage is better than risking further devaluation of the money.  Alice is likely to continue lowballing, and the potential for a better deal in later rounds is outweighed by the increasing inflation.
