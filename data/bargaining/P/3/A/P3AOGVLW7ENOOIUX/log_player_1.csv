I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob.  I figure this will encourage him to accept quickly, before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy, and I'm not going to give in to his demands.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still offering a fair share to Bob.  Hopefully, he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm starting to lose a lot of money due to inflation, and Bob is only getting more demanding. It's better to accept his offer and get something than risk losing everything."
