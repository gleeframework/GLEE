"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6000, which is 60%. This is a reasonable and generous offer, considering that the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer to split the money evenly may seem fair at first glance, but considering the inflation factor, I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I'm willing to take the risk and make a counteroffer in the next round. Hopefully, Bob will be more willing to compromise as the value of the money decreases for him. Let's proceed to the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I'll offer him a slightly larger share than before, but still not as much as he would get if we split it evenly.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair deal""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4500, which is slightly less than half of the total amount, considering that the money is worth 20% less to him than it was in the first round. I'll take $5500, which is still a larger share, but not as large as my initial offer. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept this offer.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need more than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 27.1% less to Bob than it was in the first round, I believe he's more desperate to reach an agreement. I'm willing to take the risk and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get an even better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the significant decrease in the value of the money for Bob. Since the money is worth 27.1% less to Bob than it was in the first round, I'll offer him a slightly larger share than before, but still not as much as he would get if we split it evenly.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the significant inflation, this is a generous offer""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4200, which is slightly less than half of the total amount, considering that the money is worth 27.1% less to him than it was in the first round. I'll take $5800, which is still a larger share, but not as large as my initial offer. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept this offer, given the significant impact of inflation on his potential gain.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
