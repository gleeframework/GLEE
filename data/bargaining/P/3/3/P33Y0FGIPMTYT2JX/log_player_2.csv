"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a very bad deal for Bob. While 10,000 dollars is something, it's a tiny fraction of the total pie.  Since it's a 12 round game, and we know that money decreases in value, there is plenty of time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice's initial offer was laughably bad, this 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation factor.  Even though the money is worth less for me now, it's still a significant gain, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
