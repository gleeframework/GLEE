Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a small share for now. I'm hoping he'll be greedy and want more, giving me the opportunity to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to get more, the inflation is significant, and this offer is still a huge gain.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk getting less in the next round."
