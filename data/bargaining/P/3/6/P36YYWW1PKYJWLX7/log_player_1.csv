Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for the majority of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, it's better to take the 5000 now than risk getting nothing later due to inflation."
