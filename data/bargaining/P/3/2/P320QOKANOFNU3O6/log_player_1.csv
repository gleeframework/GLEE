Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share. I reject Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the money is worth even less after the second round of inflation, I'll aim to get an even larger share. Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be more even-handed now. Considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, I'll consider this offer carefully. However, I'll still try to get a slightly larger share. I accept Bob's offer.
