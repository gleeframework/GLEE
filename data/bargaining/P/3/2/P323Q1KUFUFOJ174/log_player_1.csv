Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly, with a slight advantage for me to reflect the time value of money. This way we both avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was slightly unfair considering the inflation rate. I propose a simple 50/50 split to end this quickly and for both of us to benefit. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
