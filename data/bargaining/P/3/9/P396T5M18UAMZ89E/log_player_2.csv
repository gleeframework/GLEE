Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet in the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the rate of inflation is working against me quickly. It's better to hold out and counter with a stronger offer in the next round, hoping Alice feels the pressure of the decreasing value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money in this game! I'm proposing a 52-48 split. Let's settle now and both walk away with a significant sum.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  Emphasizing the time pressure and the shrinking pot is crucial to encourage Alice to settle. 
* **Significant Gain:** While this offer is still slightly in Alice's favor, it secures a substantial sum for both players.
* **Compromise:** This offer demonstrates willingness to compromise from my previous offer while still seeking a reasonable outcome."
