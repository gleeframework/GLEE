"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. This seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiations, as I'm giving Bob a significant amount while still keeping a bit more for myself. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer. If he accepts, the game is over and we'll divide the money according to the agreed-upon terms. If he rejects, he'll make a counteroffer in the next round, and we'll continue negotiating.\n\nRemember, with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less to Bob due to inflation, so he has an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I'll wait for Bob's response to see how the game unfolds.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision in the format:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept"" or ""reject"", ""message"": Bob's message}\n\n###\n\nI'm excited to see how Bob reacts to my initial offer. Let's keep playing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer in Round 2. Although he thinks his proposed split is fairer, I'm not convinced. Given that the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I don't see a compelling reason to accept a lower amount than I initially offered him. Additionally, since the money is worth 20% less to Bob due to inflation, I believe he has more to lose by prolonging the negotiations.\n\nBy rejecting his offer, I'm hoping to put pressure on Bob to reconsider and potentially make a more favorable offer in the next round. I'll wait for his response and see how the game unfolds.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with Round 3.\n\n###\n\n###"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn Round 3, I've decided to make a new offer that attempts to find a middle ground between my initial proposal and Bob's counteroffer. By offering $5500 for myself and $4500 for Bob, I'm hoping to create a sense of compromise and encourage Bob to accept the deal.\n\nThe message ""Meet me in the middle"" is a clear indication that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution. Given that the money is still worth the same to me, I believe this offer is a reasonable concession.\n\nAs the game progresses, Bob's incentive to accept an offer increases due to the 20% decrease in value per round. I'm hoping that this offer will be more appealing to him, considering the decreasing value of the money.\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this new proposal.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with Bob's decision.\n\n###\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This is the last round before inflation hits hard again. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIn Round 4, Bob has offered to split the $10,000 evenly, with both of us receiving $5000. Considering the current state of the game, I've decided to accept this offer.\n\nAlthough I was initially hoping to get a slightly larger share, the fact that the money is still worth the same to me and that Bob is facing a significant decrease in value due to inflation (48.8% less than in the first round) makes this offer more appealing.\n\nBob's message also implies that he's willing to settle for an even split to avoid further losses due to inflation. This suggests that he's unlikely to make a more favorable offer in future rounds.\n\nBy accepting this offer, I'm securing a guaranteed amount of $5000, which I believe is a reasonable outcome given the negotiations so far. It's time to conclude the game and divide the money according to the agreed-upon terms.\n\n###\n\nThe game is over, and we've reached a mutually acceptable agreement. Well played, Bob!"
