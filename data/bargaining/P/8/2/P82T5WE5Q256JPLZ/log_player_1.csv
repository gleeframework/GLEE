Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a very uneven split Alice.  I propose we go 60/40. It's important to make a deal quickly since the money loses value each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
