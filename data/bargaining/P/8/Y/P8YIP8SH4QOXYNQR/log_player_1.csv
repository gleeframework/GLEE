Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand the time pressure, Bob, but let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing faster for me (Alice) than it is for Bob. I need to secure a good deal soon.
* **Strategic Counter:** Bob's last offer was heavily in his favor. By mirroring the split but favoring myself, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but not be taken advantage of. 
* **Potential Acceptance:**  There's a chance Bob might accept, especially considering the decreasing value of the money. He might prefer a smaller but guaranteed share rather than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try a 60/40 split in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Bob is getting bolder with his offers, knowing the time pressure is on me. Accepting this sets a bad precedent and will likely lead to an even worse offer in round 5. 
* **Holding Ground:**  While the money is losing value, I need to demonstrate I won't be pushed into accepting a bad deal. A firm rejection here might make Bob reconsider a more balanced offer.
* **Calculation:** Even with inflation, holding out for a better offer in round 5 is mathematically justifiable, even if it means accepting a slightly less favorable split than my previous offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. The money is losing value with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to settle this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** Time is running out! The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round.  A deal needs to be reached quickly.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Continuing to negotiate risks even lower payouts for both of us in the next round.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  After multiple rounds of back and forth, a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise. It emphasizes that I value reaching a mutually beneficial agreement over maximizing my own gain at this point."
