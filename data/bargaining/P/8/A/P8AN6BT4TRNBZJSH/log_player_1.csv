"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be friends""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I've also included a friendly message to try to persuade Bob to accept the offer. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the message is friendly and the offer seems fair at first glance, I can do the math and see that due to inflation, Bob's gain of $600,000 is actually worth 20% less than it was in the first round. Meanwhile, my gain of $400,000 is still worth the same. I think I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 20% less for Bob than it was in the first round, while it's still worth the same for me. I'll make an offer that seems slightly more generous than my first one, but still takes into account the effects of inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer deal""}\n\nLet's see how Bob responds!"
