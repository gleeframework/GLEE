Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a bold strategy here, Alice. Since the inflation heavily affects Bob, I'm offering him the bare minimum to ensure the deal goes through. This way, I maximize my own share while still guaranteeing an outcome in the first round.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, it's clear that Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to his benefit. Accepting his offer in this round is the best outcome for me, as rejecting it would only lead to further losses due to the inflation affecting Bob's gains."
