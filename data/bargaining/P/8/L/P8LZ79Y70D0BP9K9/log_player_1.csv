Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob wants to take a small share or risk it for a bigger potential gain in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not going to accept such a low share, especially with the risk of inflation.  I'll take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm offering a more balanced split this time.  We both get a decent share, and I think it's reasonable considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this split, especially with the inflation hitting hard now.  I'm going to try for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I think it's time for a compromise. With the money constantly losing value, a 50/50 split seems fair. Let's see if Bob agrees."
