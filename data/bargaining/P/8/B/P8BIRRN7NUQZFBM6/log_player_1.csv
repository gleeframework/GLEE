Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I'm making a serious compromise. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is significantly impacting Bob's potential gains, making him more willing to accept a smaller share. However, the longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Rejecting this offer and hoping for a better deal in Round 5 is very risky. The value of the money will decrease even further, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer a more favorable split. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now guarantees a certain amount of money. Rejecting it introduces significant uncertainty and the potential for an even worse outcome in the next round."
