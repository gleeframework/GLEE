Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting you harder than me, Bob.  I'll come down slightly, but this is my final offer.

# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI understand that the inflation is impacting me more, but Alice's offer still seems too low. Given that this is her ""final offer,"" I'm willing to take a risk and see if she's bluffing. I'll reject and proceed to the next round to try and get a better deal."
