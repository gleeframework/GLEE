"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This way, we're both getting a decent share, and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, even though it's a 50/50 split, the value of the money is lower due to inflation, and I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, Bob, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but don't expect me to give up too much! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, although the split is slightly in Bob's favor, it's not a huge difference, and I'm not sure if I can do better in future rounds. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'd rather take what I can get now."
