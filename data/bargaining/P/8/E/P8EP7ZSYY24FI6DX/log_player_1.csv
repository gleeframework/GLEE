"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finalize the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous with the first offer, let's try to get more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I think it's still a bit too skewed in his favor, and I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze out a bit more.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I think I can still do better and get a more favorable split. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, Bob! Let's meet in the middle again!""
}
```

I'm trying to inch closer to a more balanced split, taking into account the continued inflation."
