"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you less, but I'll still give you a decent chunk. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $320,000.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with Bob getting $600,000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
