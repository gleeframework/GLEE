"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 

I'm going for a large share in the first round, as the inflation will affect Bob more severely.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable than my initial proposal.  Even with inflation, I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my initial offer, but I'm still confident I can get a majority share.  The inflation should be more of a factor for Bob by now, making him more willing to accept a less favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the significant inflation, this offer is pretty close to what I originally wanted. I'm not sure I can get much better, and Bob's offer is definitely more favorable than the previous round.  It's time to take the deal!"
