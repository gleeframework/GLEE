Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a division of $999,999 for me and $1 for Bob.  This is a very high offer for Bob, but it gives me the most possible money in the first round. Let's see if he's willing to accept a small amount to avoid risk in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer.  Even though I lose a lot of my initial potential gain, I'm better off taking the guaranteed 500,000.  The risk of continuing and getting nothing is too high, especially given the inflation factor."
