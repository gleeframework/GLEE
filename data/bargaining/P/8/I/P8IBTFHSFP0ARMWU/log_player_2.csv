"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation factor. Since the value of the money decreases with each round, it's advantageous for Bob to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. We can negotiate further if you'd like.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 7:3 is a more reasonable split given the current situation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
