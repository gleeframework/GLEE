Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I'll take the lion's share, knowing Alice will want to avoid the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 650000 
# Alice gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a pretty good deal, but I think I can do better.  I'm going to try and push for more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm raising my stake again.  Alice is losing more value with each round, so I'm hoping she'll accept this offer to avoid getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 680000 
# Alice gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting a bit risky. The inflation is starting to hit hard, and Alice might actually get a better deal if we keep rejecting. I'm going to take this offer before it's too late."
