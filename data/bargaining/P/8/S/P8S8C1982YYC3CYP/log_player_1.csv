"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and divide it almost equally, considering I started.""}\n\nI'm offering $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, emphasizing the fairness of the division and the fact that I initiated the offer. This division slightly favors me but still provides Bob with a substantial amount, encouraging him to accept the proposal early on to minimize the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a more favorable split. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the impact of inflation, accepting $45 (which is now worth 20% less) in the second round seems less favorable than attempting to negotiate for a better split in the next rounds. The difference in inflation impact between us (20% for me vs. 10% for Bob) might give me some leverage in later rounds, as Bob might be more inclined to settle to minimize his losses due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground to secure our gains.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, aiming to find a middle ground that considers the impact of inflation on both of us. Given that the money's value decreases more significantly for me, I'm slightly adjusting the offer to encourage Bob to accept, while still trying to maximize my gain. The message emphasizes the urgency of securing our gains due to the devaluing effect of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure from Bob is mounting, but considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I must weigh the options carefully. Given that this is Bob's ""final offer"" and the money's value continues to decrease more rapidly for me, I might be inclined to accept this offer to secure some gain, even though it's less favorable than my initial proposals. However, the difference in how inflation affects us might still allow for some negotiation room in later rounds, but with the risk of ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. Considering these factors, I will accept Bob's offer to ensure I receive some amount, as the risk of continuing and possibly ending up with nothing due to inflation and the time constraint seems too high.\n\n {""decision"": ""accept""}"
