"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round due to inflation, but for Bob, the value remains the same. In the previous round, Bob offered an even split, but I rejected it.

### Step 2: Calculate the effective value of money for me in this round
Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me, and we are in Round 3, the money is now worth 20% less than its original value (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3). This means if I propose to take X dollars, I effectively get 0.8X dollars in original value.

### Step 3: Consider Bob's perspective and potential next moves
Bob knows that the value of money does not decrease for him, so he may be inclined to wait for further rounds, hoping I'll offer him more due to the decreasing value of money for me. However, Bob also knows that if the game continues too long, I might offer him less and less in absolute terms, as the effective value for me decreases.

### Step 4: Formulate an offer that balances my needs with Bob's potential willingness to accept
Considering the above, I need to balance between offering enough to Bob to make him accept and ensuring I get as much as possible given the decreasing value of money for me. An offer that is slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer but does not overly compromise my gain could be appealing.

### Step 5: Decide on the offer and message for Bob
Given the considerations, offering Bob slightly more than the initial 40% could incentivize him to accept, especially since the alternative is continuing the game with uncertain outcomes. An offer of 55% to Bob and 45% to me seems reasonable, considering the decreased value of money for me.

### Step 6: Construct the offer in the required JSON format
The offer will be: {""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's compromise.""}

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's compromise.""}"
