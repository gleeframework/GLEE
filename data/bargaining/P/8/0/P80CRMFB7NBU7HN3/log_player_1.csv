"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 60 and you take 40. No need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation. Let's move forward and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 45 is enough for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly more generous offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. 52/48 seems like a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's end this here.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
