4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be a little more equitable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Remember, the value decreases each round for both of us, so a quick agreement benefits us both.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, it seems like we both want to be efficient with this diminishing value. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. It's closer to the middle ground, and given the inflation, it's better for both of us to settle now rather than lose more in another round.",Alice,3,
