"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer.  I get $65, you get $35. This gives us both a decent share. Think carefully about the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems reasonable at first, it's important to consider the inflation.  Since I (Bob) only lose 5% per round, I can likely get a better deal if I reject and make the offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly, giving you $40 and myself $60.  We both get a better deal than your previous offer, and we can avoid the inflation taking a bigger bite out of our share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer wasn't bad, but it still favors you in the long run. I'm proposing $58 for me and $42 for you. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I (Bob) would prefer a higher share, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy at this point.  With each passing round, the inflation hits Alice harder than it does me.  Continuing to reject offers could result in a much smaller share for both of us by the end of the game. It's better to settle for a slightly less favorable deal now than risk losing a significant amount due to inflation."
