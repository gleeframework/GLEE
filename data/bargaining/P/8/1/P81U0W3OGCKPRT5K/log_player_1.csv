Let's see if Bob agrees to a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm starting with a generous offer, knowing that if he rejects it, I'll be able to increase my share slightly with each passing round due to the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it may seem tempting to take the $1,000, remember that the value of the money is decreasing with each round due to inflation.  I'm willing to wait and see if I can secure a better deal in the next round, where I'll be the one making the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9250, ""bob_gain"": 750}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, knowing that Bob is now feeling the pressure of the inflation effect.  He may be more inclined to accept a smaller share, as his gains are diminishing with each round too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $2,000 is more than the $1,000 he offered in Round 2, it's still a significant decrease from the $9,000 I was hoping for initially. Inflation is making the value of the money significantly lower, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9375, ""bob_gain"": 625} 
```

I'm again increasing my share slightly, pushing the boundaries of what I think Bob might accept. This time, I'm also considering the impact of inflation on both of us. I believe Bob is feeling the pressure of diminishing returns with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is increasing, the inflation effect is really starting to bite. My share is still significantly less than the initial $9,000 I was hoping for. I am determined to hold out for a better deal. I am confident that I can still negotiate a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9500, ""bob_gain"": 500}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but this time I'm being more cautious. Inflation is hitting both of us hard now, and I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my share and ensuring that Bob doesn't feel so pressured that he might just accept a very low offer. I'm hoping this offer will finally be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I am still disappointed that I am not receiving the share I initially desired, it's clear that Bob is becoming more resistant to my offers, and inflation is making each round more challenging. This offer, while not ideal, represents a significant increase in my share from previous rounds. It's time to accept this offer and move on."
