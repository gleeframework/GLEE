"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit unfair. Let's be reasonable - I propose I take $60 and you take $40.  The value decreases for both of us with each passing round, so let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
