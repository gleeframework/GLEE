"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $300,000 and keep $700,000. You can do better in the next round, I'm sure!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it down the middle. We both get a good chunk of the money this way, and we can avoid any further risk of losing it! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Splitting it down the middle might seem fair, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 81% of its original value now (90% of 90%), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a free pass, Bob! I'll give you $400,000, but I'm taking the lion's share. Don't expect any mercy from me!""
}
