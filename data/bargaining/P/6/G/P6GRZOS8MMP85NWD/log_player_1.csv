Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start. I'm hoping he'll accept it, but if he rejects it, I'll be able to make a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a pretty good deal considering the inflation. Accepting this offer is better than risking getting a worse deal in the next round."
