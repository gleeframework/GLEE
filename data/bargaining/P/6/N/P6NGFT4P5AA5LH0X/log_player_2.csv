"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's too early to accept a 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly. We can both get a good amount of money this way.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take this offer. Even though it's not the 50/50 I proposed, it's better than getting nothing at all with more rounds and the risk of more inflation."
