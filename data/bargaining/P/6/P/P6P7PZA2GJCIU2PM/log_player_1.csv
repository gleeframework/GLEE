"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}

I'm proposing a slightly unfair split in my favor. This ensures a good chance of Bob accepting in the first round, as he'll get a decent amount.  However, I'm also leaving room for negotiation in case he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best course of action. I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, and if I reject, I risk ending up with nothing in the later rounds."
