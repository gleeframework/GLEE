"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more reasonable, but I'm not done negotiating yet. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's actually $160,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too generous to Bob. I'm willing to give up more.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the ongoing inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied. I want a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, so it's actually $204,800.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough for me. I'm willing to wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,

```

I'm making a bold move by suggesting a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finally wrap up the game."
