"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the $100 with an 80/20 split in favor of you, Bob. This is to encourage cooperation and fairness. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I could try to strategize for future rounds, accepting this offer is the best choice in the first round.  There's no guarantee of a better offer later, and the money is worth less with each passing round."
