Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the inflation disadvantage I'll face in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'll reject this offer. While I'm losing value each round, it's still in my best interest to keep trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm offering a more even split this time, with $6,000 for me and $4,000 for Bob. While I'm still facing inflation, I'm trying to make a compromise while also prioritizing my own gains."
