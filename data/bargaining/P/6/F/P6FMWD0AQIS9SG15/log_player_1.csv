Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the numbers are:

Alice gain: $100,000
Bob gain: $720,000

I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, considering he's getting the majority of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.
