"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my wallet.

I'll think about it for a moment... Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'd rather not take a smaller share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, 50-50. No more negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to avoid further negotiations and get a fair deal."
