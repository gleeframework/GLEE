"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 90% and you get 10%. It's a fair start, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to begin with, hoping to get a better deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's start with a more balanced proposal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my gain is decreasing with each round!

Considering Bob's proposal, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split than my initial 90/10. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
