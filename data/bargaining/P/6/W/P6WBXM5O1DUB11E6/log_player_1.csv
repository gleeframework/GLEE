"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60, you take 40. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more than your initial offer, but I think 55/45 is a fair split. We can still work towards a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 45 is worth 20% less than my initial offer of 60, which is equivalent to 48.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if 55/45 is the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain is worth 20% less than 48, which is equivalent to 38.4.

I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. 50/50 seems like a fair split, considering the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
