"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth the $4,000 I'd be getting, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to make another proposal to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a larger portion for myself."
