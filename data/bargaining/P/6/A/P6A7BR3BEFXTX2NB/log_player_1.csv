"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll get $5,000 and Bob will get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have taken 50/50, now I'm making a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is now 40/60, I'll have to consider whether it's a good deal. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting the same value as before. However, Bob's gain is worth 10% less than before, so he's getting a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'll make a new offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""You're getting a good deal, but I'll give you a bit more. Consider this!""}

I'm trying to give Bob a slightly better deal, while still getting a decent share myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still lowballing me, time to make it worth my while! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is pushing for a bigger share!

I'm not thrilled about giving him 65% of the total, but I'm also not eager to go to the next round and risk losing more value due to inflation. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

After considering the offer, I'll accept this one. I'll take the 35% share and hope that Bob will be satisfied.
