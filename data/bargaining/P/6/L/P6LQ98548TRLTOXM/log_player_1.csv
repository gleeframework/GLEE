"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70:30 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's work together to reach a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% reduction in value due to inflation, my gain of $70 is now worth $56.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable than the initial offer, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a 50:50 split. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the 20% reduction in value due to inflation, my gain of $56 is now worth $44.80.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still need to get something out of this deal. Accept this and we can move forward.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
