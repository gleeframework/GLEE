Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is severely undervaluing the impact of inflation. While she's right that this offer is a middle ground of our previous offers *nominally*, the actual value she's losing each round makes this a very good deal for her. I'm betting I can push her further."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice.  Take it or leave it - the clock is ticking and you're losing money fast!""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:**  I'm applying direct pressure with the ""final offer"" approach and highlighting the time constraint. 
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 510,000 is a small step back from my previous 520,000, making it seem like a compromise.
* **Inflation Factor:**  Alice needs to realize that even a 49/51 split is highly advantageous to her given the rapid devaluation of her share."
