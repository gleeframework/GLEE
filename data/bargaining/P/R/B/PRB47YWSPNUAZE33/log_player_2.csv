"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split it 55/45. This way we both get a decent amount, and we can finish the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly larger share this time, but I think we can still come to a mutually agreeable split. Let's avoid getting caught in the inflation spiral! ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not comfortable with a 20% difference. Let's try 48/52, a bit closer to a 50/50 split. We still have a lot of rounds left, so let's aim for a more balanced outcome. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm taking this offer. It's a good deal for me, and avoids the risk of further inflation."
