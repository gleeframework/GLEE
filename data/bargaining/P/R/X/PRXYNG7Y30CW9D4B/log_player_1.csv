}
```

In this offer, I propose that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. I've also included a message to Bob, suggesting that this is a fair division and that we should close the deal to avoid losing value due to inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This ensures we both benefit from closing the deal now. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
