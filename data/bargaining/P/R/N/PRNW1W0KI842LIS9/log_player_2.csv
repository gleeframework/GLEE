Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! Considering the inflation, I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. 57-43 is a fair deal, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
