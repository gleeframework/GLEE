Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose that I get $99 and Bob gets $1. This is a very fair offer, as I am taking the risk of being the first to offer a split. I expect Bob to be reasonable and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more than $50, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  Since we only have 12 rounds, and Bob seems to be more willing to split the money evenly, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the future.  Plus, the inflation factor means that Bob's offer is worth less in subsequent rounds.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk getting nothing at all."
