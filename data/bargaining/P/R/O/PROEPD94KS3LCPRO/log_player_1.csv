"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation factor.""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable given the current situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, considering the inflation factor. Let's see if you'll accept it this time. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal. The 60-40 split is still not ideal for me, considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly better share considering the inflation factor. Let's see if you'll accept this revised offer.""}

I'm trying to be more flexible and offer a slightly better deal, hoping Bob will accept it this time."

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not satisfied with the offer. The 55-45 split is not enough for me, considering the significant decrease in value of my money due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 50/50 split. Let's see if you'll accept it this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this is a reasonable offer, considering the severe inflation factor. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. It's not ideal, but it's a decent outcome given the circumstances."
