"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight advantage for me, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $4,000 is actually equivalent to $4,000 / 0.9 = $4,444.44 in the previous round's value.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up a significant advantage, but I'm also not sure if I want to risk going to the next round. Let's see...

I'll decide to reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but still a good compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving Bob too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Let's calculate my gain in the first round's value: $3,000 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = $4,134.89

I'm not thrilled about giving up this much, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll decide to accept this offer.
