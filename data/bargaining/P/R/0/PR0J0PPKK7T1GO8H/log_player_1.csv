"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not giving up control. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly than Bob, it seems!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to get a larger share, especially since I'm losing value with each passing round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting me more harshly, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of.""
}
```

I'm offering a smaller share to myself to account for the inflation, but still trying to get a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting much, but it's better than nothing at this point. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. With the money worth even less than before, I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to get a larger share, even if it means risking getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the current reality. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 22.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 77.5,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I need something for my efforts.""
}
```

I'm offering a smaller share to myself, but trying to get a decent amount considering the current situation."
