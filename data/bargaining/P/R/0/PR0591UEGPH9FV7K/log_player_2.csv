"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take a thousand, Bob. We can both get richer next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation penalty isn't too bad, and I think I can get a better deal. Besides, Alice's ""generous"" offer is a pretty lowball one!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more reasonable offer this time. Here it is:

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
