"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation penalty you face 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer sounds somewhat fair on the surface, I need to push for a better deal in the early rounds.  The impact of inflation is significant in the later rounds, and I want to leverage that to my advantage now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I understand the situation, but I need a bit more. This offer is a good compromise.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This is a slightly better deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is correct that her previous offer was generous *considering the later rounds*. However, it's still early, and a 42/58 split in her favor is not acceptable.  I need to show her I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 470000, ""alice_gain"": 530000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's settle this fairly.  This is my final offer.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** By round 4, the shrinking pot due to inflation is becoming a real concern. It's important to signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement soon.
* **Slight Concession:** I've increased my offer slightly from round 2 to show some flexibility, but it's still tilted in my favor. 
* **Finality:**  The ""final offer"" statement is a calculated risk. It might push Alice to accept, but it also raises the stakes if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'final offer' wasn't good enough. This is a better deal, considering the inflation impact on your gain. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me. We're now past the halfway point, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing rapidly.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice has consistently rejected my offers, indicating she's willing to wait me out, exploiting the inflation to her advantage.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While 43/57 isn't ideal, waiting further means the offers are likely to get worse for me, not better. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
