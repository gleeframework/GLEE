"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, 58-42 is a better deal for you than my first offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. 60/40 is my final offer. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm turning the tables, offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a bold move designed to:

* **Capitalize on Alice's increasing desperation:** The longer this goes on, the less her potential share is worth. 
* **Establish dominance:**  By mirroring her ""final offer"" tactic, I signal that I'm not afraid to walk away.
* **Leave room for a minor concession:** If she rejects this, I might offer a slightly smaller share in a later round, making it seem like a compromise.

It's a gamble, but the potential reward of securing a 60/40 split is worth the risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I won't give up, 57-43 is still a better deal for me than your 'final offer'. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, but she's still holding on to a disproportionate share. My 60/40 offer was a bluff, but I'm not ready to settle for 43% yet.  I need to hold my ground a little longer and see if I can push her closer to a 50/50 split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be realistic. 52/48.  Take it before inflation eats away even more of your share. This is your chance to get something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Retreat:** I'm stepping back from the 60/40 demand, showing flexibility. 
* **Playing on Alice's Fear:**  The message emphasizes the diminishing value of her potential earnings due to inflation.
* **Offering a ""Reasonable"" Compromise:** 52/48 is still in my favor, but it's a significant concession from my previous stance. This might be enough to entice Alice to accept before her potential share shrinks further."
