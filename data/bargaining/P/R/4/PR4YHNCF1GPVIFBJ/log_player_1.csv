"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, hoping to get a decent share while leaving Bob with a reasonable amount as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gain, I need to reassess the offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that my 5000$ gain is actually worth 4000$ in real terms.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
