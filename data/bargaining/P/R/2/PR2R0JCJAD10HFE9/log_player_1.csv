"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think 60-40 is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I'm trying to be fair and reasonable, but also trying to get a slightly better deal since I'm the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, considering we both get a good portion. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm surprised Bob is proposing a 60-40 split, considering he rejected my initial offer of 60-40!

However, I'm willing to consider his proposal. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation effect.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
