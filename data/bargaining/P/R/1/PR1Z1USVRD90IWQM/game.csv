60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. I propose I take $60 and you get $40.  It's better to secure a deal early as the value decreases over time.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I think your previous offer was a bit unfair. Considering the inflation, I propose a 55-45 split. This way, we both get a decent amount, and it's still early in the game.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I appreciate your attempt, but your offer doesn't quite reflect the situation. Since time is literally money for me, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, I understand the pressure of inflation is on you, but I'm not willing to give up more than I have to. My new offer is 58-42 in my favor. It's still a relatively fair deal considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're getting close to a point where the deal isn't worth much for me. I'm offering you $48, which is a significant amount considering the circumstances. Let's wrap this up and avoid further losses for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I can see the pressure is mounting on you due to inflation. However, I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get a better deal. I'm offering 60-40 in my favor. It's still a better deal for you than waiting further and losing even more value.",Bob,6,
