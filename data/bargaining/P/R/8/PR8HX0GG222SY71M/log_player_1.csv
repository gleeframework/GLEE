Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'm willing to split it almost evenly.  This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's more even, it still heavily favors Bob. I'm hoping he'll be more reasonable in the next round."
