{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be more realistic. How about a 60/40 split?  This accounts for the time value of money with inflation impacting me more.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  Inflation is hurting us both, but we need to compromise.  I propose an even split of $50 each.  This ensures that we both get a fair share before inflation eats away too much more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
