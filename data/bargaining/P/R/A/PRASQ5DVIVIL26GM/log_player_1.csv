# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's now my turn again. Here's my next offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increased impact of inflation on me, I'll take a bit more to compensate""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this to Bob."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I've already made my next offer in the previous response, I'll just repeat it here for clarity:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increased impact of inflation on me, I'll take a bit more to compensate""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds to this offer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. The inflation is eating away at this deal, we need to settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in Round 4. The increasing impact of inflation, especially on my side, makes further negotiation less advantageous. Bob's offer seems reasonable given the circumstances, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk further devaluation."
