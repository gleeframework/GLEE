"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to counter 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to take that into account.

My decision is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain. It's my turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a slight adjustment from my previous offer""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share for myself and being reasonable, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not convinced 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being a tough negotiator! Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, which is now 48.8% less than in the first round, I think I can do slightly better.

My decision is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to accept a 45/55 split, especially considering the significant inflation effect on Bob's gain. It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5250,
  ""bob_gain"": 4750,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, but still a bit of a gap, let's try to meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that balances my own gain with being reasonable for Bob, considering the inflation effect on his gain. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation effect on Bob's gain is really taking a hit now! Considering the significant decrease in value, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal.

My decision is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, given the extreme inflation effect on his gain, I think 48/52 is a fair split. I'm willing to compromise and take the 4800, considering the circumstances."
