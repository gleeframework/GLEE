"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm keeping the remaining 60% for myself, which is $60. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 40/60 split. How about we aim for a more balanced 55/45? Let's find a way to make this game work for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $45 is now worth 95% of the original $60, which is $54.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $55 is worth 95% of the original $40, but I'll assume it is for now.

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to reject it for now. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 45 is enough for me, let's try to do better""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate, my gain is now worth 90% of the original $60, which is $54, and then another 5% less, so my gain is $50.40.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more for myself""
}
```"
