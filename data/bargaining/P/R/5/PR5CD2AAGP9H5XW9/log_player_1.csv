"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'm not sure if I want to accept Bob's offer, as it's still a relatively close split. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and having to deal with even more severe inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer and hope for a better one in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to prioritize my share. Consider this a fair offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $44, which is a slightly more aggressive split, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation effect is really kicking in now!

With my gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be very cautious with my decisions. Bob's offer of $45 is a relatively small amount, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

However, considering the rapid inflation, I'm starting to think that accepting a smaller amount now might be a better option than risking going to the next round and having even less value for my share.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
