"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll give you a chance to reconsider 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob's trying to make a move.

I'll think about it... Okay, I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55-45 split, giving me $550,000 and Bob $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no more games 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to meet me in the middle now.

I'll consider it... Okay, I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's a fair split and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the value of the money decreasing even further.
