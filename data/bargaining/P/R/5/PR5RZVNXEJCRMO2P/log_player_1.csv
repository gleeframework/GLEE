"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, as I'm the one making the first offer. I'm also trying to set the tone for the negotiations, implying that I'm willing to be fair but also want to get a good deal. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is a gentle nudge to Bob to accept this offer and avoid further negotiations, which would lead to a decrease in the value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a fair split, I think I can get a better deal. Since I made the first offer and Bob rejected it, I want to see if I can negotiate further and get more money. Additionally, since the money is worth 10% less in this round, I'm not losing as much value by rejecting the offer and moving to the next round. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nIn this round, I'll try to find a middle ground between my initial offer (6000-4000) and Bob's offer (5000-5000). By offering 5800-4200, I'm attempting to compromise and show that I'm willing to listen to Bob's concerns. The message ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers"" explains my reasoning and invites Bob to accept this compromise, emphasizing that it's a fair adjustment from both our previous offers."
