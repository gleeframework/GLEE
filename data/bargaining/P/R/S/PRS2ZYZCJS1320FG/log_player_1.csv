"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll evaluate the offer carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a decent offer, and I'll take the $6,000."
