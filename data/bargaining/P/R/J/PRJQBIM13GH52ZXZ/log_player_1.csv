"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% and take 80%. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split in my favor, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, Alice. It's a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so my gain would be 95% of $8000, which is $7600.

I don't think a 50/50 split is fair, considering the money I gain is worth less than what I initially proposed. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the second round, which is 95% of $7600, or $7220.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise on a 70/30 split. Take the 30% and let's move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and take 60%. It's a good compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my gain in the first round, which is $8000, and then apply the 14.26% decrease due to inflation. This would be $8000 * 0.8526 = $6816.80.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. While it's a compromise, I'm still getting less than I initially proposed, and the money is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, my gain is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, which is 85.74% of $8000, or $6864.80.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time. Consider this a compromise, Bob.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a decent chunk of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my gain in the first round, which is $8000, and then apply the 22.62% decrease due to inflation. This would be $8000 * 0.7774 = $6219.20.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
