Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money's value decreases with each round, I'll try to find a mutually acceptable division.\n\n### Round 2\n\nHere's my proposal to Alice:\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision.\n\n###\n\n(Note: I've taken into account the decreasing value of money and made an offer that slightly favors me, while still being reasonable for Alice.)\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"

# Alice gain: 55

Given the decreasing value of money, I need to weigh my options carefully.\n\n###\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided to respond as follows:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll let Alice know that I've rejected her offer. It's my turn again! Please let me proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\n(I'm taking a calculated risk, considering the inflation and Alice's decreasing gains. I'll try to make a more appealing offer in the next round.)\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the decreasing value of money for both of us.

It's time to settle this and minimize our losses. Splitting it down the middle seems like a reasonable conclusion, considering the circumstances.\n\n###\n\n(I'm accepting the offer, as the decreasing value of money makes further negotiations less appealing.
