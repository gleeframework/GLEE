Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  Let's be done with this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting worse with the inflation working against him. While $450,000 is a significant amount, holding out for a better deal still makes sense. Bob is likely feeling the pressure of the diminishing value of his potential gain."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 620000,
""bob_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous.  Take this deal before your share shrinks even further.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Do you agree? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob offering a 50/50 split is a significant shift in his position and likely driven by the increasing impact of inflation on his potential gains. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant sum ($500,000) instead of risking a worse outcome as time runs out.  It's better to secure a fair deal now than potentially end up with nothing."
