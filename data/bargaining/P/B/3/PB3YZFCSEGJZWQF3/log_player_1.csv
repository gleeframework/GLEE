Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the initial offer, Alice. Given the inflation, I think this split is more reflective of the situation. It still gives you a decent share, and we can avoid dragging this out. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
