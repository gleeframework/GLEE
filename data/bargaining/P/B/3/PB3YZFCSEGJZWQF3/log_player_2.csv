"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a slightly larger share, but we can adjust in the next rounds if you prefer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems tempting on the surface, it's important to remember the steep inflation. If I reject this offer, I become the proposer in the next round. Given the rapid devaluation of the money for Alice, I'm in a strong position to negotiate a much better deal in Round 2."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Thanks for the initial offer, Alice. Given the inflation, I think this split is more reflective of the situation. It still gives you a decent share, and we can avoid dragging this out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Inflation:**  Alice's money is devaluing at twice the rate of mine. By Round 2, her $40 is already worth significantly less to her.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Proposing $60 for myself establishes a strong position. While it's a reversal of her offer, it's justified given the rapidly changing circumstances. 
* **Urgency and Compromise:** My message emphasizes the need to settle quickly due to inflation, but I'm offering a ""decent share"" to encourage her to accept rather than risking further losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We've both lost some value due to inflation. A 50/50 split seems fair to me, considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The inflation is really starting to bite now. Accepting $50 now is better than risking a worse deal later when the money is worth even less. 
* **Fairness:** While I could push for a slightly better split, Alice's offer of a 50/50 split is reasonable given the circumstances. It avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we keep negotiating.
* **Time Pressure:** We're already on Round 3 with 9 rounds left. It's time to secure a reasonable deal while we still can."
