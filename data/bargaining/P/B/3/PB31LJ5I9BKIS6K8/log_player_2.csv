Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer? 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, time is working against Bob. It's crucial he signals a willingness to accept a less favorable deal soon, or Alice will have no incentive to offer him anything better."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, how about a perfectly even split? That's more than fair.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn to be firm 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. Inflation is eating significantly into Bob's potential gains.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob some money.  Rejecting this offer is very risky as Alice is likely to offer even less in subsequent rounds, knowing time is on her side."
