"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the original value.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* My gain: $5,000 (80% of $6,250, which is 20% less than $7,500)
* Bob's gain: $5,000 (90% of $5,555, which is 10% less than $6,200)

I'll reject this offer, as I can do better than a 50-50 split.
