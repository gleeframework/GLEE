"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, giving us both a good chunk of the money to work with. This allows us to be more flexible and potentially find better opportunities down the line. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
