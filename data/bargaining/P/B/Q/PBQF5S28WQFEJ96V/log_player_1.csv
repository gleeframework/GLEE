"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd be getting $400,000, which is still worth $400,000, and Bob would get $600,000, which is worth $540,000.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll accept the offer.
