"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm starting with a somewhat aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money. It's risky, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a lopsided deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than the previous round, Bob's offer is still fairly unfair. I'm going to gamble on inflation affecting him more than me and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my demand, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. Inflation might be affecting Bob more, and I want to see if he's willing to compromise to avoid losing even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  Inflation has hit Bob harder, and I'm unlikely to get a better deal. I'm securing a decent amount of money, and it's a good time to end the game."
