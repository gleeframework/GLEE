750000.0,250000.0,Let's split the money in a 3:1 ratio. I'll take 750000 and you'll get 250000. It's fair and ensures we both benefit from the division.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,I think a 60:40 split is more fair. It's a better deal for me as we move into round 2 and inflation starts to affect the value of the money.,Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Considering the inflation, let's go with a 6:4 split. This offers a balanced approach, ensuring a fair distribution while accounting for the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.",Alice,3,
