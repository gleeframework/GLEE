""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60:40 split is more fair. It's a better deal for me as we move into round 2 and inflation starts to affect the value of the money.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's go with a 6:4 split. This offers a balanced approach, ensuring a fair distribution while accounting for the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
