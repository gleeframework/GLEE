"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI, Alice, propose that I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that a 60-40 split is a reasonable and fair division of the $10,000. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor.  I'm willing to meet closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I'm Alice, I need to consider the impact of inflation on my gain. In the first round, I proposed a 60-40 split, but Bob rejected it. Now, in the second round, Bob is offering a 55-45 split. However, due to inflation, my gain of $5500 is actually worth 20% less than it was in the first round. This means my effective gain would be $4400 ($5500 * 0.8).\n\nConsidering this, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a more favorable split or at least minimize the impact of inflation on my gain.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob! I'm waiting for your next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll consider the inflation again. Since my gain is worth 20% less each round, I need to adjust my proposal to minimize the impact of inflation. Let's recalculate the value of the money for me: in Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, and 40% less than in Round 1.\n\nI'll propose a division that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. I'll offer a slightly more favorable split for Bob to try to reach an agreement.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give a bit more to reach an agreement""}\n\n###\n\nI, Alice, propose that I receive $5800 and Bob receives $4200. I've included a message to Bob explaining that, considering the inflation, I'm willing to give a bit more to reach an agreement. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out Alice, and the value diminishes with each round. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, I need to carefully evaluate Bob's offer, considering the significant impact of inflation on my gain. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my effective gain would be $2662.40 ($5200 * 0.512). This is a substantial reduction in value, and I must weigh the pros and cons of accepting the offer.\n\nOn one hand, accepting the offer would guarantee me a gain of $2662.40. On the other hand, rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round would risk further reduction in value due to inflation. Since Bob mentioned that this is his final offer, I should consider the possibility that he might not be willing to negotiate further.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. The risk of further value reduction and the uncertainty of the next round's outcome outweigh the potential benefits of holding out for a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI, Alice, accept Bob's offer of $5200 for me and $4800 for him. I believe this is the best decision, given the circumstances and the impact of inflation on my gain."
