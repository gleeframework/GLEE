Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. I'm offering you 400k, and I'll take 600k. What do you say?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about a 49-51 split? I'm trying to be reasonable! 
# Bob gain: 510000 
# Alice gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd love to get more, taking a 510,000 gain after inflation is a good deal. Let's end this!"
