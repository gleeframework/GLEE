"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and we can adjust as we go. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair to me, and I believe we can find a better split. Let's proceed to the next round.\n###\n\nPlease let me know what happens next. I'll be happy to continue playing the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer that I think is more reasonable. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll take that into account in my proposal.\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a more balanced offer, and we should consider the decreasing value of money.""}\n###\n\nLet me know how Alice responds to my offer. I'm ready to proceed with the game.\n###\n\n### Assistant:"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly this round.  Inflation is hurting us both, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to proceed. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n###\nI'll accept Alice's offer this round. Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of money, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise. It's better to secure a fair share now rather than risking further devaluation in future rounds.\n###\n\nLet me know the outcome of the game. I'm ready to conclude the negotiation.\n###\n\n### Assistant:"
