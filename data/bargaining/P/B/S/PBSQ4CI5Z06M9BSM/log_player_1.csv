"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the original 100$, which is 30 dollars. I'll take the remaining 70 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation now.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and Bob's offer is an even split, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 50 / 0.9 = 55.56 (since 50 is 90% of the original amount)
Bob's gain: 50 / 0.8 = 62.5 (since 50 is 80% of the original amount)

Considering the inflation, I'd be better off with my original proposal, but since Bob's offer is an even split, I'll consider it. I'll accept this offer.
