"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. How about I take $70 and you get $30?  This is your last chance for a decent amount before inflation eats into it. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
