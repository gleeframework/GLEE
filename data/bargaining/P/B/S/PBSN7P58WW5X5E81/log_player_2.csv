"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Your split wasn't unfair, but it benefits you more in the long run. I'm offering a compromise closer to the middle.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
The value of the money decreases faster for Alice than for Bob, so it's in Bob's best interest to drag out the game. However, Alice is unlikely to offer a much better deal than this. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount, even considering the slight loss from inflation.
