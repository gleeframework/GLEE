"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take a bit more to account for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle.  We both get a fair share, and we can avoid the inflation hitting us too hard.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the attempt at a fair split, Bob. But remember, time is on your side, not mine. This offer is my bottom line this round. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is slightly better than my previous proposal, and the inflation is starting to become a real threat.  It's time to take what I can get."
