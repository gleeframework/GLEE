"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more, huh?

I'll think for a moment... With the inflation, my gain of 400k is still a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's enough to make the game worthwhile. On the other hand, Bob's gain of 600k is a significant amount, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I still think 58% is fair!""

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself by offering Bob a slightly higher share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve more, especially considering the value of money is decreasing 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the decreased value of money, I'm not sure if 300k is enough for me. Bob's gain of 700k is still a significant amount, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.

However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal.

# Bob's message: I'll give you 200k, but I think I deserve more, considering the value of money is decreasing rapidly 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the decreased value of money, I'm not sure if 200k is enough for me. Bob's gain of 800k is still a significant amount, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out.

However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 100k, but I think I deserve more, considering the value of money is decreasing rapidly and I'm getting desperate 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and Bob is getting desperate!

Considering the drastic decrease in value, 100k is a relatively small amount, but I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round. I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might try to make an even lower offer in the next round.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
