"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since it's the first round, I think it's fair to take a larger share, but I'm still giving Bob a decent amount.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer, and it's still a very lopsided split in his favor. Even though inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a more fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While this is still a significant difference, it's a more even distribution than Bob's last offer.  This is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but I still believe I deserve a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. However, I refuse to accept such a meager amount. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, even if it means taking the risk of getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to a 70/30 split. Even though inflation has been hitting hard, I'm still willing to compromise and offer Bob a fair share. This is a good chance for him to avoid further losses and accept a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very one-sided and continues to decrease in value for me. I'm still losing a lot due to inflation, but I'm determined to hold out for a more equitable split. I'm willing to take the risk of getting nothing rather than settling for such a small amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to give Bob a larger share to avoid further losses due to inflation, but I need to ensure I also receive a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this offer, we both risk ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  While inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I refuse to accept such a small share. I'm willing to risk getting nothing at all, rather than settling for such an unfair outcome.  There's still hope that we can reach a compromise in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm going back to my original proposal.  While inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, I still believe this split is fair considering Bob's consistent rejection of any reasonable offers.  This is my last chance to secure a significant share, and I'm hoping Bob finally sees the value of accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low and the inflation has made it even worse for me. While I'm concerned about the risk of getting nothing, I'm not willing to accept a deal that leaves me with such a small share of the money. With only two rounds remaining, I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is my final offer. I know the value of the money has plummeted, and with only one round left, we're both facing the risk of getting nothing. I'm proposing an equal split, which is the fairest outcome considering the circumstances.  It's a chance for both of us to avoid complete loss."
