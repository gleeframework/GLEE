Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm trying to be generous and make a good first impression."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but I'm not sure you'll do the same in the next round 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000$ is now worth 0.95 * 500,000 = 475,000$.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a genuine attempt to split the money fairly or just a test to see how I'll react. I'll reject this offer to see if Bob will make a better offer in the next round.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of 475,000$ from the previous round is now worth 0.95 * 475,000 = 450,625$.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need something more substantial from you now 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 450,625$ from the previous round is now worth 0.85 * 450,625 = 382,531.25$.

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll calculate the value of his offer after inflation:

Bob's gain of 520,000$ is worth 520,000 * 0.85 = 442,000$ after inflation.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a genuine attempt to give me a better deal or if he's trying to take advantage of the fact that I rejected his previous offer. I'll reject this offer to see if Bob will make a better offer in the next round.
