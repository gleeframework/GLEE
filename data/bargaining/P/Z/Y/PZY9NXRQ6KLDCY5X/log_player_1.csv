"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair and balanced division of the $10,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, a 50/50 split seems like the most logical choice. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a very fair proposal, and I'm happy to accept it.
