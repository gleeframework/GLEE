"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm starting with a relatively fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  We can split this evenly! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, my proposal in the first round would have been equivalent to $72 for me and $16 for Bob.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get, but it's a fair split, so I'll consider it. However, I'm hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the second round, the effective value is now 90% of the value in the second round, which is 90% of $80 (the value of $100 in the first round). So, the money is worth $72 in this round.

I'll make a new offer, trying to get a bit more:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more, Bob!""
}
```"
