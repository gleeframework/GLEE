I'm going for a very aggressive opening move. I'll take almost all of the money and leave Bob with a tiny piece. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each round, he might be more inclined to take even a small amount than to risk getting nothing at all in a later round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very greedy! While he is losing value on his money, he's also losing 20% of his gain with each passing round.  I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate a bit more fairly in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm still trying to get the majority of the money, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more this round. By offering Bob 100,000, I'm hoping to show that I'm open to a reasonable deal. I'm confident that the value of his share will continue to decrease as the rounds progress, making this offer more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to be very greedy, even though his money is losing value at a much faster rate now. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to come closer to a 50/50 split in the next round.  I'm starting to feel like this game is going to go down to the wire."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000} 
```

With each round, Bob's share of the money continues to decrease significantly.  It's time to start getting closer to a fair deal. I'm going to offer a 55/45 split in my favor, which is still more than what I offered in the previous round but recognizes the decreasing value of Bob's share. Hopefully, he sees that we need to reach a compromise soon or we'll both end up with nothing."
