"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm giving you a good chunk of the money, Bob.  Hopefully, we can both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a generous offer for the first round, I'm sure we can negotiate a better deal for me as the rounds progress and the money loses value faster for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I'm taking advantage of the faster inflation rate on your side. Let's make this a fair deal, but one that benefits me a little more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split the money closer to 55/45, considering the inflation rates.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I could try to push for a better deal, the inflation is starting to become a serious factor. Accepting this offer ensures a decent amount for me, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
