**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, accepting now would still give Alice a significantly larger share. The inflation is hurting, but there's still a chance to negotiate a better outcome.  It's getting risky, but holding out a bit longer might encourage Alice to make a more balanced offer."
