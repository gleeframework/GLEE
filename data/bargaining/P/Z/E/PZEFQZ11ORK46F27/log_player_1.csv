"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

It's Bob's turn again!"
