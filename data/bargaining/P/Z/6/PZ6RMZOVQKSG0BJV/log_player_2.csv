"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob! Take this 1000 and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer!  I'll make a much fairer proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This split seems fair to both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it evenly. We both get a fair amount and we don't have to keep playing this game. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is finally being reasonable. Taking $5,000 now is better than risking getting a worse offer later as the inflation eats away at our potential gains."
