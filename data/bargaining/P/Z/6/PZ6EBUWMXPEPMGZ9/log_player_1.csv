"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer.

Here is my proposal:
```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```
I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less now, I'm not as eager to take the smaller share.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money further, I'll aim for a larger share.

Here's my new proposal:
```
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```
I'm now offering a 50-50 split, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less now, I need to be more cautious.

However, considering the drastic reduction in my potential gain, I'll accept Bob's offer this time.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
