I'm going to offer a very favorable deal for you, Bob! I'll take 9000, and you can have 1000.  Let's get this game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and with inflation, the money will be worth less each round. It's better to accept this than risk getting nothing."
