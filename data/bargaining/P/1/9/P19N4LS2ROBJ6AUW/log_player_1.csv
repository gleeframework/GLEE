"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both walk away with a decent amount!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a fair share considering the initial amount, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm hoping for more. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, aiming for a slightly better split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can get a better deal. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less, I need to be even more aggressive in my proposal. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $5,000. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than risking even less in the next round."
