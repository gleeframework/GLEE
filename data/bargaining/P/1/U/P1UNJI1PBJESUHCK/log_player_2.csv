# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40, with me getting 60 and you getting 40.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split. Let's end this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest. Let's end this here and both get an equal share. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to get 50% than 0% after inflation.  Let's call it a day."
