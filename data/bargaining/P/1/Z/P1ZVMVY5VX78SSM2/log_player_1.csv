Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This acknowledges the potential of future inflation, giving us both a larger share before it takes effect. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
