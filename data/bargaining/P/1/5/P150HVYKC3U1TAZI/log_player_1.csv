"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, which I believe is fair considering the value of the money decreases with each round. Let's make this quick and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
