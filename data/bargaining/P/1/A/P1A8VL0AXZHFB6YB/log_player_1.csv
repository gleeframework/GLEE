"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

For now, I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} and proceed to Round 3. Maybe I can do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a better deal. I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the pie."
