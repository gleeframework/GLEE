Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take 9000 for myself, leaving 1000 for Bob. Since this is the first round, I want to secure a large share while leaving a small amount for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the previous round's 1000, it's still significantly lower than what I would have gotten in round 1. I'm betting on inflation impacting Bob's calculations as well, and hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a 6000/4000 split. Since I rejected his offer, I'm now in control. I want to offer something slightly better for him than the previous round while still securing a majority for myself. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal and avoid further inflation."
