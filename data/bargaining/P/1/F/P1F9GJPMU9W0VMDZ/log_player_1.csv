Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me.

I'll think for a moment... With the 50-50 split in round 1 rejected, Bob is trying to take a larger share in this round. Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was again 55-45, I'll try to adjust my offer to get a better share. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a more significant increase in my share. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm starting to feel a bit desperate. However, I still think I can do better. The 55-45 split in Bob's offer is still slightly unfavorable to me, and I'm not sure if I should settle for it.

I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the significant inflation that's affecting my potential earnings. Since Bob has been trying to take a slightly larger share, I'll try to take a larger share myself. Here's my new proposal:

# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on my potential earnings. With the value of the money decreasing so rapidly, I'm starting to feel the pressure.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. While it's a slightly more favorable split than his previous offers, I'm still not sure if I'm getting the best deal possible.

However, the value of the money is decreasing so rapidly that I'm starting to think that I should accept this offer rather than risking going into further rounds and potentially getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept this offer.
