Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair deal, Bob.  Let's try this: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but it's still more than your last offer, and it gives us both more money.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
