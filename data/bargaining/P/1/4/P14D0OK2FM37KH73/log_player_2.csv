# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 48,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting me more, I need a better deal 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob, but her offer is still not in Bob's best interest.  While time is running out, Bob can likely secure a better deal by holding out a bit longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is a fair split, especially with the time pressure. Let's close this out."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Given the increasing inflation and the limited rounds remaining, Bob needs to make a decisive move.  Offering a 50/50 split is fair and might be the most appealing option for Alice at this point, as the value of her potential gain is decreasing rapidly."
