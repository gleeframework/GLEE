Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a 50/50 split, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise slightly and offer you 20%. This is a win for both of us, especially considering the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still trying to take the lion's share! I'm not giving up on a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."
