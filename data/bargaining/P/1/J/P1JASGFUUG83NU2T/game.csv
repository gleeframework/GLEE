6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good deal for you in the first round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"Your turn, Alice. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor. Considering the inflation, accepting now is a smarter choice than hoping for a slightly better deal later.",Bob,2,
