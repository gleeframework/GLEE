"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a classic bargaining game. I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself slightly.  It's a strong opening offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, I'm concerned about inflation. If I reject this offer, I risk ending up with nothing. Accepting the offer gives me a guaranteed 40% of the value, which is better than risking it all."
