"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
While it seems fair on the surface, Alice is using the inflation rates to her advantage. It's best to see what I can propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation makes things tricky. How about we try a slightly different split this time?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation hits you harder, I'll take a bit less this time 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is now more reasonable, and the longer I wait, the more I lose due to the higher inflation rate. Accepting 48 now is better than risking an even lower amount in subsequent rounds."
