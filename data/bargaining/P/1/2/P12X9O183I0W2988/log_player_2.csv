Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to 800k, but I'm not going any lower.  We need to reach a deal soon or inflation will eat away at our profits. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is starting to move in the right direction, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  The threat of inflation is real, but accepting a poor deal out of fear will hurt more in the long run. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a larger share."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to get at least 700k.  Time is running out. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, but her latest offer is still unacceptable. While getting only $300,000 sounds terrible due to the inflation, accepting such a low amount sets a bad precedent and shows Alice I'm willing to cave to pressure. I need to hold my ground a little longer and see if I can get her closer to a 50/50 split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're running out of time. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal. Take it or leave it."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Alice needs to understand I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  A 50/50 split is the most logical compromise, and by framing it as my final offer, I'm hoping she'll see the writing on the wall before inflation eats away too much of our potential winnings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm going lower than before, but I'm not going any lower than 650k.  We're both losing money with every round, and we need to find a solution soon.  Let's work together to get something before we both end up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but the risk of getting nothing is getting too high. Alice is unlikely to move much further from her 650k stance, and while 350k is far from ideal, it's better than walking away empty-handed after another few rounds of inflation."
