Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to adjust my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer. The money I'd gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I'd only get $3,800, and Bob would get $6,000, which is 20% more than his original share in the first round. I'd rather wait for a better offer.
