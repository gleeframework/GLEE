"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and see how it goes from here!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can reassess our strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share to keep things interesting! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about this one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to make up for the lost ground. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get left with nothing!""}

I'm proposing that Bob gets a bigger share, but I'm still trying to hold onto a significant portion of the money. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a tiny share to keep you from getting completely shut out! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still pretty lopsided, but I'm not sure I can afford to reject it.
