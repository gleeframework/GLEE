Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the ongoing inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less with each round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $10,000, which should give me a higher absolute value after the inflation adjustment."
