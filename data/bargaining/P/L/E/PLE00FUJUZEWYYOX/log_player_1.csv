"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  While it might seem unfair, remember the inflation factor favors me more than it favors Bob.  I believe this is a fair starting point that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split in my favor.  While Bob's offer was tempting, I'm confident I can do better.  I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a larger share considering the inflation advantage I have."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is making it increasingly difficult for me to get a better deal. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, especially considering Bob's loss of value due to inflation."
