"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 30% of the initial amount. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way we both get a good start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, I'll calculate the actual amount I would gain if I accept Bob's offer:

$50 * 0.9 (10% less) = $45

My offer in the first round was $70, but now I'm considering $45. Bob's offer is $50, which is more than what I initially offered.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
