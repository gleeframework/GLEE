I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, giving Bob $1000. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and end the game quickly. I want to maximize my share while minimizing the risk of inflation eating away at my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy!  I'm not going to accept this offer.  I'd rather see how this plays out over the next few rounds.  I'm hoping the inflation will make him more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

Since Bob seems unwilling to compromise, I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount for myself, but still keeping a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping that this will incentivize Bob to think about a more reasonable deal in the future. Inflation is a factor, and I need to make sure I get a good share before it erodes my potential earnings further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous! Bob seems to be getting more stubborn with each round. I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll take my chances with inflation and hope for a better outcome in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm going to keep offering a significant portion of the money to myself, but I'm starting to be more realistic about the inflation and Bob's stubbornness. I need to find a balance between getting a good share and not losing out entirely to inflation.  I'm hoping this offer will make Bob reconsider and start thinking about a more fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being extremely unreasonable, and I'm starting to get concerned about inflation. However, I'm not willing to accept this offer yet. I'll see if the inflation will force him to become more flexible in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439}
```

I'm still pushing for a good share, but I'm realizing the inflation is really starting to hurt.  I'm offering a bit less for myself this time to try to find a middle ground.  It's a risk, but I'm hoping Bob will start to see that we both need to compromise to get something out of this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is really pushing his luck now. I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, but I'm still not willing to give in to this kind of blatant greed. I'll keep holding out and see if he comes to his senses in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096}
```

Inflation is a real problem now, and I'm worried about getting nothing at all. I'm lowering my offer again, but still trying to get a decent share. I'm hoping Bob will finally start thinking about a reasonable deal before we both lose everything."
