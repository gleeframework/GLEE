I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal before the inflation kicks in too much.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being greedy!  I'm not going to accept a 50/50 split when I know the inflation will only hurt him more in the next round.  I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly less generous offer, hoping Bob will see that he's better off taking something than nothing.  We're both losing money every round, so the sooner we come to an agreement, the better."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still being stubborn!  I'm not going to accept his offer.  The inflation is hurting him more than me, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still trying to get a good deal, but I'm realizing I need to be more flexible. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still getting a larger share.  I'm hoping Bob will finally see that it's in his best interest to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offers are still not good enough.  I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal. The inflation is really starting to hurt him now, and I'm confident I can get a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm going to mirror Bob's previous offer. He's feeling the pressure of inflation, and I'm hoping he'll accept this deal before it gets worse for him.  We're both losing money with every round, and this feels like a fair compromise."
