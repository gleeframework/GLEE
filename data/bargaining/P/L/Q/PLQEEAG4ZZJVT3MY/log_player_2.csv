Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer.  While I am compromising, it's important to show her I'm willing to walk away for a better deal, especially as inflation eats into the value."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with every round, so let's find common ground.  This offer is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally agree. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I need to start considering the impact of inflation more seriously.  Alice is unlikely to move much further, and any potential gain from holding out is quickly being eroded by the decreasing value of the money."
