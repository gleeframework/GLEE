"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 3:1 split.  Let's try a 60/40 split.  This way, we both get a fair share, and we can finish the game quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
