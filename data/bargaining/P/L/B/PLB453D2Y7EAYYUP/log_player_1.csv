"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the total. This is a relatively fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 450,000 is actually worth 360,000 in the original currency, and Bob's gain of 550,000 is worth 490,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was for 550,000, I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the offer, considering the inflation:

My gain of 500,000 is worth 520,000 in the original currency (since it's 100% of the new amount, and 100% / 0.9688 = 1.032, but due to the 20% decrease from the previous round, we have to multiply by 0.8 and then multiply by 1.032, which gives us 520,000).
Bob's gain of 500,000 is worth 385,000 in the original currency (since it's 100% of the new amount, and 100% / 0.7279 = 1.374, but due to the 10% decrease from the previous round, we have to multiply by 0.9 and then multiply by 1.374, which gives us 385,000).

I'm not thrilled about the fact that Bob's gain is worth less than mine, but it's a fair split. I'll accept this offer.
