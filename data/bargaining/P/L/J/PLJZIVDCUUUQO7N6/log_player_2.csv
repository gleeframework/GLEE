"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal. It's only Round 1, and I'm not willing to settle for 40% just yet. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor. We're still early in the game, and I think this is a fair compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth more to me than to Alice, and I'm hoping she'll accept this offer to avoid further inflation. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here. We both lose money with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest solution, and it ensures we both get something. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nA 50/50 split seems like a great deal, especially considering the inflation. I'd rather take a guaranteed 50% now than risk losing more value in future rounds. Plus, Alice's message makes sense - we both lose money with each round, so it's better to settle now. I'm happy to accept this offer and end the game!"
