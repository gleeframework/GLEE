"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it roughly equally, considering the inflation penalty you face is higher. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's proposal is fair, I can likely do better. I'll see if I can get a larger share, even with the higher inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice.  Let's try 550/450, as my inflation rate is higher. This way, we both gain a little more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my new offer is slightly more in my favor, but still reasonable for both. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still slightly more in her favor, but I'm holding out for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I'll see if I can push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, with inflation hitting us both, let's try an even split. This way, we can secure the most value before things get even worse.""}
