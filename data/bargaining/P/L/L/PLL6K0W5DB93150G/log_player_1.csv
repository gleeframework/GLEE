"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a significant amount, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think I deserve more than 30% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. My gain of $300,000 is worth 80% of the original $600,000 I proposed in the first round, due to the 20% inflation. That's a significant drop.

However, Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 95% of the original $400,000 I proposed, which is a relatively smaller drop due to the 5% inflation.

Considering this, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm not willing to give up too much of the original $1,000,000. Maybe he'll come back with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think this is a fair split considering the original amount.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to maintain a balance between our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share now 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully about the new numbers. My gain of $400,000 is worth 40% of the original $600,000 I proposed in the first round, which is a significant drop due to the 48.8% inflation.

However, Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 85% of the original $400,000 I proposed, which is a smaller drop due to the 14.26% inflation.

Given that Bob is trying to meet me halfway, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the inflation and the fact that Bob is trying to meet me halfway."
