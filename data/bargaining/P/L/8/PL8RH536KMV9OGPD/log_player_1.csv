Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground. I think 40% is a reasonable offer considering the inflation hit I'll take if we continue. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
