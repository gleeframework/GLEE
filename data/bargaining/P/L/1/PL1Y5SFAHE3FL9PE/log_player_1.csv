"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2,000 and keep $8,000.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount, but still a significant portion of the total, to try to encourage him to accept the offer."
