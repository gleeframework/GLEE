I'm sticking with my previous offer. While the inflation hurts, I believe this is the best outcome for me in this round. It's likely that if we keep rejecting, the inflation will make my offers less appealing while Alice might continue to offer me a tiny amount."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Alice is being very stubborn and refusing to even consider a fairer division.  Even with inflation, I'm confident I can get a better deal than this if I keep rejecting."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```

While inflation is hurting my gains, I'm sticking with my previous offer. It's the most I can hope for at this point. Alice's stubbornness is making me believe that she's not going to budge, so I'm hoping that my consistent offer will eventually convince her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is ridiculous, especially with the amount of inflation that has already occurred.  I am still confident that I can negotiate a much better deal.  I will continue to reject her offers and hope that she will eventually come to her senses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
```

I've decided to lower my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Alice. This is still a much better deal for me than accepting her offer, especially given the ongoing inflation. I'm hoping this slightly more generous offer will encourage her to finally accept, rather than continuing to reject my offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still absurd. While inflation is hitting my gains hard, I'm convinced that I can still negotiate a better deal. Even though she's rejected everything so far, I'm not giving up hope for a more reasonable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I've lowered my offer again, but I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. Inflation is taking a significant toll, but I'm hoping this offer will be enough to finally get Alice to agree. If she continues to reject, the inflation will only hurt me more, and I'm not sure how much lower I can go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is insulting.  While inflation is a serious issue, I refuse to accept such an unfair division.  I will continue to fight for a better outcome, even if it means potentially losing more money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I've lowered my offer once again, but I believe it's still a fair deal.  Inflation is making this incredibly challenging, but I'm holding out hope that Alice will finally see reason and accept this offer.  If she continues to be stubborn, I'm not sure what else I can do."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 12.

Round 13
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 45.96% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is being incredibly unreasonable.  Even though inflation is significantly reducing the value of the money I gain, I will continue to reject her offers.  I will continue to negotiate for a fairer deal, even if it means potentially losing more money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 13.
Round 14
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

I've reached a point where I'm willing to accept an even split. Inflation has eroded my potential gains significantly, and it seems like Alice is determined to keep most of the money.  A 50/50 split is the best I can hope for at this point, given her stubbornness."
