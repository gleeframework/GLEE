"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but generous, offer. I'm willing to give you a good portion of the money to start things off. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While she calls it ""generous,"" it's far from it. The inflation rate working against Alice will incentivize her to make a better offer in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. Your previous offer was far from fair. This is a much more balanced split, and time is working against us both.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but your offer was still too lopsided.  This is a fairer split. Let's work together to reach a good outcome. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but this offer is still heavily in her favor.  I need to show I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but this needs to be a deal we can both agree on.  Time is literally money for both of us, especially you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's agree on a more balanced split.  This offer is fairer to both of us, and we can avoid losing even more. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation and is willing to make a deal where we both benefit. Accepting this prevents further losses for both of us and ensures I get a reasonable share."
