"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but I'm open to negotiating further 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a larger share, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll try to negotiate further in the next round. For now, I'll take the 4000 and hope to do better in the next round.
