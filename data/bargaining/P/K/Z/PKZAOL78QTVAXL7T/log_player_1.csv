"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you can have 40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65/35 split is more fair, reflecting the different inflation rates we face. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 65/35 split is fair, considering the initial offer I made was 60/40, which was a more even split. I'm not willing to accept a split that favors Bob more. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation rates. Your turn!""}

I'm proposing a new split that takes into account the decreasing value of money, with me getting 55% and Bob getting 45%."
