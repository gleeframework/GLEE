"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. Given the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases with each round, I'm aiming to find a balance that Bob might find acceptable to avoid further devaluation. My message, ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more,"" acknowledges that I'm taking a larger share but frames it as a gesture of fairness considering the game's structure and the fact that we both lose if no agreement is reached within 12 rounds. I'm hoping this initial offer might appeal to Bob's desire to secure his share before the money's value drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer in Round 2. Although the money's value has decreased due to inflation, Bob's proposed split of $45 for me and $55 for himself doesn't seem fair considering the initial offer I made and the significantly higher rate of devaluation I'm facing (20% decrease for me vs. 5% for Bob). Accepting this offer would mean I'm accepting a significantly lower value than initially proposed, without a substantial concession from Bob that acknowledges the asymmetrical impact of inflation on our gains. By rejecting this offer, I aim to push for a more balanced division in the next round, hoping Bob will recognize the need for a compromise that accounts for the unequal effects of inflation on our potential gains."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn Round 3, I've decided to make an offer that slightly adjusts my initial proposal to account for the ongoing inflation and Bob's previous offer. By proposing $58 for myself and $42 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges Bob's desire for a more favorable split while also considering the more significant impact of inflation on my potential gains. My message emphasizes the need for finding this balance, hoping to appeal to Bob's understanding of the game's dynamics and the mutual loss we face if no agreement is reached within the time limit. This offer still favors me but is more concessionary than my first, aiming to be more palatable to Bob while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, since we are both losing value with each round 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn Round 4, considering the significant decrease in the value of the money for me (48.8% less than the first round) and the ongoing devaluation for both of us, I've decided to accept Bob's offer of an even split. At this point, the impact of inflation is substantial, and the difference in our loss rates makes each subsequent round more disadvantageous for me compared to Bob. By accepting the 50-50 split, I'm securing a share of the money that, while significantly less valuable than at the start, is still preferable to risking further devaluation or the possibility of ending the game with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. This decision prioritizes certainty and immediate gain over the potential for a slightly better offer in future rounds, considering the rapidly diminishing value of the money for me."
