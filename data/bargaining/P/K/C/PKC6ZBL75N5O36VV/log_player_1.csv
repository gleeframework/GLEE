"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, which is a very reasonable offer, don't you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Here's an equal split, let's call it a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to be greedy, doesn't he?

I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer, and hope it's more generous!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob! Accept my offer!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, but still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This time I propose a 55-45 split, let's see if you accept. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's trying to take advantage of the inflation! My gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, but he's still proposing a 45% share for me.

I'll think about it for a moment... and decide to reject his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not giving up yet! I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a bit more for myself, but still being somewhat reasonable, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise with a 52.5-47.5 split, let's see if you're ready to accept. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! My share is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

I'm not sure about Bob's offer, but I think I can do better than a 47.5% share. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer and see if he's willing to give me a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob! Meet me at 48-52 and we can wrap this up!""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split a bit more in my favor, but still being somewhat reasonable."
