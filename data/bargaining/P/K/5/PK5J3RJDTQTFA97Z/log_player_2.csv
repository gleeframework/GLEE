"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40% - a good deal for you considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to negotiate for a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is decreasing for you each round. I'll take a bit more this time, 65%-35% seems fair in this situation. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll try to push for one more round, hoping that Alice might be willing to compromise a bit more, given that I'm taking a bigger hit from the inflation each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the significant impact of inflation on my gains, I'll try to propose a split that still seems reasonable but takes into account the devaluation of the money for me. Given that Alice's value remains constant, I'll aim for a compromise that might appeal to her willingness to end the game with a deal rather than risking further negotiations.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the substantial loss I'm taking from inflation, I believe this split is more than fair. Let's conclude this before it devalues further for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's getting critical for you now. I'm taking a strong stance, but 70/30 is the best you'll get at this point. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the severe impact of inflation on my potential gains, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action. The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round, and risking another round could result in an even less favorable outcome. Alice's offer, although not ideal, provides a certain value now rather than the uncertainty and potential for a worse deal in the next round."
