"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the actual amounts he's offering: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000 and 6000 / 0.8 = 7500.

I'll accept this offer.
