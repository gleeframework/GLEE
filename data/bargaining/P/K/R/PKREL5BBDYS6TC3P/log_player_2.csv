Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer or we both lose out. It's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but her offer is getting worse with each round from my perspective.  While the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds. It's unlikely Alice wants to walk away with nothing, so I need to push for a better split while it's still worthwhile for me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both get a substantial sum.  Let's end this now before the inflation eats away at the value any further.""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming a serious factor now. While I believe I have some leverage, I need to make a strong stand to avoid a complete loss.  A 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point, as it's fair and straightforward. This gives Alice a final chance to accept a good deal while emphasizing the urgency of the situation."
