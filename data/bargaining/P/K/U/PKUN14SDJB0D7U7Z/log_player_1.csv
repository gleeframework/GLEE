"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  50/50 seems like the most reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $500,000 is actually worth $400,000 in real terms.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, especially since I had offered a more favorable split in the first round. I'd like to propose a compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose 60/40 in my favor.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 20% inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value. So, if I were to offer a 60/40 split, I'd be offering Bob $640,000 and keeping $360,000 for myself.

However, considering the inflation, I'd like to adjust my offer to account for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a larger share this round. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
