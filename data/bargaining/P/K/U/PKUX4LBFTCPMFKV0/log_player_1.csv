"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal!""
}
```

This offer gives me $60 and Bob $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to negotiate his own worth!

I'll think about it for a moment... Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer. However, I'm not convinced that a 50-50 split is the best deal for me, especially since I'm not getting any extra for my own negotiating skills.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll offer a slightly more favorable split, considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money for Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm still hoping to get the better deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still confident I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! It seems Bob is sticking to his guns.

Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money for Bob even further, I'm not sure if I want to give him an even bigger share. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round either, since the money will be worth even less.

I'll think about it... Ah, I'll accept this offer, but only because I don't see any other way to get a better deal.
