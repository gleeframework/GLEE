"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose taking 90$ for myself and giving Bob 10$. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor will favor him more in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
A 50/50 split is a fair deal given the inflation factor will continue to devalue Bob's portion of the money more than mine."
