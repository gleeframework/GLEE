I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I want to secure a quick agreement.  Hopefully, he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's significantly less than my initial proposal, I'm not sure how many more rounds we have to play. Accepting now guarantees me at least half of the money, and the inflation is a serious risk."
