Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair deal.  Inflation is hitting us hard, but we can both still get a decent amount if we agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is simply a reversal of my previous offer, taking advantage of the inflation that affects him more than me.  While the deal might seem tempting as time goes on,  I'm confident I can negotiate a better outcome.  There's no need to rush into an unfavorable agreement."

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still deserve a larger share since inflation barely affects me. 55/45 seems fair considering the circumstances.""
