"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me a smaller share, I'll have to consider the impact of inflation. If I accept this offer, I'll get $45, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 95% of the original $50 I would have gotten in the first round. On the other hand, Bob's share is $55, which is worth 90% of the original $50 he would have gotten in the first round.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I should reject this offer.

Bob's gain of $51 is worth 72.9% of the original $50 (100 - 27.1% = 72.9%).
