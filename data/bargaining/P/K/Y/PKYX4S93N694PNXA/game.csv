900000.0,100000.0,"Let's make a deal, Bob.  I get $900,000 and you get $100,000. This way we both benefit from dividing the money now rather than waiting for later rounds where it loses value.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Let's be fair, Alice. I propose a 60/40 split.  This way we both get a significant share.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, my previous offer was more than fair. Yours was too greedy. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to account for the decreasing value. Do you accept 800,000 for me and 200,000 for you?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and this money is losing value for you. My last offer was fair, but I'm willing to compromise slightly. Let's split it 55/45 and end this.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, we need to settle this now. Time is literally money for me in this game! You're not losing anything while my share shrinks each round. 750,000 for me and 250,000 for you is my final offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, I understand the situation, but I need to look out for myself too.  My offer is more than fair considering the time pressure. 520,000 for me and 480,000 for you.  Let's close this deal.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a significant amount of money, more than you'd get if we split evenly now. 650,000 for me and 350,000 for you. Accept this and we both win, otherwise, we both lose. Don't be greedy, Bob!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Take it or leave it, we are running out of time!",Bob,8,
