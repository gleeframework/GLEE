"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $60. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is fairer, since I'm the one taking the risk of rejection this round. Let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to stick with the 60-40 split, but now he's offering it to me instead.

However, I'm not convinced that I should get less than I initially proposed. Considering the inflation, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer from round 1 was already quite generous. This time, I'll aim to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You said 60-40 is fairer? I'll meet you halfway, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining $100, which is $45, and I'll take the remaining 55%, which is $55. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise!"
