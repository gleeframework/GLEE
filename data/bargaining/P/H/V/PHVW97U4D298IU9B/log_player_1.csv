"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair and reasonable offer!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the 100$, leaving 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. How about a 90-10 split in my favor? It's a fair offer considering the value of money will be decreasing. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the 10$ I'd gain in this round is actually worth less than the 20$ I would have gained in the first round.

I'm not eager to accept a 90-10 split, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more reasonable offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you take 40. It's a fair split considering the decreasing value of money.""
}
```"
