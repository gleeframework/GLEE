"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is $20, and I'll take the remaining 80%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor will affect Bob's share more in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair deal and we can both get the most out of it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob in the second round, his 50% offer is actually equivalent to $45 in the first round's value. That's a pretty good deal for me!

I'll accept Bob's offer.
