Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable. I'll take 60% this time, and you get 40%. This is a fair compromise, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's do 55/45, with me getting 55% and you 45%. We both still get a decent amount, and we can avoid further losses from inflation.

While I aimed for a slightly better split, accepting Alice's offer now is crucial. Here's why:

* **Significant Inflation:** The longer this goes on, the less those dollars will be worth. We're already losing significant value.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I hold out for a slightly better offer in the next round or two, the impact of inflation means the actual gain will be minimal. 
* **Risk of Losing It All:**  If we don't reach an agreement, we both walk away with nothing. 

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk ending up with nothing."
