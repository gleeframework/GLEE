"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob! I'll give you a chance to reconsider.""}

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not too big!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to keep the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
