4500.0,5500.0,"I understand your offer, but I think we can find a more equitable split.  Since the money is losing value for me, I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This gives you a decent share while acknowledging the inflation issue. Let's reach a compromise.",Bob,2,

6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, it's clear you're feeling the pressure of the inflation. I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly to 65/35. This is my final offer. Accept it now, and we both walk away with something.  Reject it, and the value decreases for you again.",Alice,3,

6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, the inflation is impacting me significantly. I can't accept a further reduction in my share. I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which is closer to your initial offer and acknowledges the situation. It's the best I can do at this point.",Bob,4,
