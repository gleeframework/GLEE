"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the offer. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not happy with a 60/40 split. I think we can do better than that. Let's see what happens in the next round.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. Since we both rejected the previous proposals, I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and will avoid further inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nA 50/50 split sounds fair, and considering the inflation, I think it's a good idea to accept this offer and avoid further losses. Let's shake on it and end the game here!"
