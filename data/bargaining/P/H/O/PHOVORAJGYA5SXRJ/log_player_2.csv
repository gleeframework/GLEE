"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's be friends 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept the ""fair share"" offer, but considering the inflation, it's better to see what Alice's next offer will be.  As the rounds go on, her offer will become less appealing because her money is worth less, while mine will stay the same."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more balanced split.  We can work from here.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, last chance 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I initially wanted. While I might be able to get a slightly better deal in the next round, it's not worth the risk. Her money is losing value quickly, and I'm not sure if I can get a significantly higher offer."
