"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 49/51, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll need to be more cautious. Since the offer is now 50/50, I'll stick with it, as it's a fair split and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
