"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking the majority, but I'll consider his offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to reject this offer because I think I can do better. I'm willing to compromise, but I want a more balanced split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair compromise""}

I'm adjusting the split to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant portion of the total amount. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, I'm willing to compromise.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer, as it's a slightly more balanced split than his previous offers. I'll take $4,500 and Bob will take $5,500. Let's hope this is the final offer!"
