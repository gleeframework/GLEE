Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leave Bob with 40%, which is $400,000. My message is a friendly invitation to split the money in a way that seems reasonable at the start."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $300,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $270,000. Bob's share of $700,000 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $560,000.
