"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation rate.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my gain of 50 in this round is actually equivalent to 40 in the previous round.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about a 50/50 split. I'd rather wait for a better offer.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think 70 is a fair amount for me. You can have 30.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think 65 is still too high for me. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, my gain of 65 in this round is actually equivalent to 32.16 in the first round, but adjusted for the 5% less for Bob it's 32.16 / 0.95 = 33.92 which is very close to 35, so I'll round it to 35 for simplicity.

However, I'm not sure about the 65/35 split. I'll consider it, but I'd like to make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the 65/35 split. I'd rather make a counteroffer: 72 for me and 28 for you.""

Since the money is worth 67.23% less for me and 22.62% less for Bob, my gain of 71.5 in this round is actually equivalent to 22.35 in the first round, but adjusted for the 5% less for Bob it's 22.35 / 0.95 = 23.58 which is very close to 23.5, so I'll round it to 23.5 for simplicity.
