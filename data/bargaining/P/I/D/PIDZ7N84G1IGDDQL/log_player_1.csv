"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000. I'll take the remaining $600,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'll be making the next offer if you reject this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 0.95 * 600,000 = 570,000
* Bob's gain: 0.95 * 400,000 = 380,000

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, considering I rejected your previous offer. I'll reject this one as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 0.95 * 570,000 = 541,500
* Bob's gain: 0.95 * 380,000 = 361,000

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```"
