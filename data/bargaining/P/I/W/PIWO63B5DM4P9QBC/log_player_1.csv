{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""A fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get 600,000 and Bob will get 400,000. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for the negotiation."

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
