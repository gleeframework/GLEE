900000.0,100000.0,I propose a 90/10 split. This ensures a good start for both of us. Let's work together to divide the rest of the money fairly.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,Let's be fair. 50/50 split is the most equitable solution. We can avoid any future arguments and keep the value of the money at its highest.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. This ensures a fair outcome for both of us, while still acknowledging the slight advantage I have due to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to ensure a decent share for myself. 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation we're dealing with. Let's agree on this and move on.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"I'm willing to go down to 70/30. We're both losing value with each round, so let's find a middle ground. This is a good balance between fairness and ensuring we both get a decent share.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
600000.0,400000.0,We are both losing value with each round. Let's be reasonable and settle on 40/60.  I'm willing to compromise to avoid losing even more.,Bob,6,
