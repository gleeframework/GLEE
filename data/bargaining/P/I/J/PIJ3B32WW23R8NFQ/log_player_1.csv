# Bob's message: Your turn! I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up quickly. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the effects of inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'm hoping to use this to my advantage in the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder, let's settle on this""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm taking into account the increased impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, aiming to use this as leverage to secure a larger share for myself while still presenting it as a reasonable compromise."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it before inflation eats us alive! 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains, especially on Bob's, I've decided to accept this offer. The difference between our proposed amounts has narrowed, and given the rapidly diminishing value of the money, securing this amount now seems more prudent than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
