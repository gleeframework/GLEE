"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! You'll get 20% of the original amount, which is still a good deal!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original amount, and Bob will get 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of 450,000 is actually worth 90% of the original 800,000 I proposed in Round 1. That's a significant drop.

I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and try to do better in the next round.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slight edge due to the risk of future rounds""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money continues to erode due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to avoid further erosion of value 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 400,000 is actually worth only 64.7% of the original 800,000 I proposed in Round 1. That's a significant drop.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or reject it and try to do better in the next round. The erosion of value is getting worse with each passing round.

I'll think about it... 

After some consideration, I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to balance my desire for a larger share with the risk of further erosion due to inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot between getting a decent share and not getting too greedy, given the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to make a stronger push for a larger share, considering the erosion of value 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, another rejection!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 300,000 is actually worth only 48.2% of the original 800,000 I proposed in Round 1. That's a significant drop.

I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out, and the value of the money continuing to erode. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

However, I think I should be more aggressive in my next offer, considering the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement soon.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 50/50, but I'll need you to agree now, as the value is dropping rapidly""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive and propose a 50/50 split, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money continues to erode. I'm putting the ball in Bob's court and hoping he'll agree to this offer."
