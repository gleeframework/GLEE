Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation, but a 65/35 split is still too much in your favor. Let's compromise with 54/46. It's closer to my previous offer, and we can finally end this game. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54
