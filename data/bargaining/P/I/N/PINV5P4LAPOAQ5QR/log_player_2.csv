**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her potential winnings diminishes.  While her offer isn't terrible, we're still in a strong position to push for a better deal.  She's likely to concede further in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be real.  The clock is ticking and this is a fair deal for both of us. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting for both players. Alice is feeling the heat of inflation more acutely. 
* **Fairness as leverage:**  By proposing an even split, Bob comes across as reasonable and might make Alice more receptive to accepting.  
* **Firm but not greedy:**  The message is direct and conveys a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. This might be enough to push Alice to accept a deal that, while not ideal for her, is significantly better than risking a total loss."
