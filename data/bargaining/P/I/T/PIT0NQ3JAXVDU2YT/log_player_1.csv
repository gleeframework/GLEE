Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm offering you $40, which is still more than you'd get if we continue to reject each other's offers. We both lose money with each round. Let's end this amicably. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
