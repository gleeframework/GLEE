"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I get $70 and you get $30.  It's important to settle this early because the value decreases quickly for both of us with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to settle for such a lopsided deal in the first round! There's plenty of time left to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm offering you $40, which is still more than you'd get if we continue to reject each other's offers. We both lose money with each round. Let's end this amicably.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, I appreciate the offer, but we're losing money fast. Let's split the difference between our previous offers - I get $65, you get $35.  We'll both be better off. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Alice is likely to keep lowering her offer in future rounds, and I'll lose more money with each passing round.  This is the best deal I'm likely to get."
