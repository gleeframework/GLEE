Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. Your offer was way too generous to yourself. I'm proposing a more reasonable split this time, considering the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
