Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. Your offer was way too generous to yourself. I'm proposing a more reasonable split this time, considering the inflation working against you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, but 30/70 is simply too unfair. Let's compromise.  I propose a 40/60 split, which is a fairer reflection of the current situation. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
