"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for further negotiation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since I'm not sure how much inflation affects Bob's perception of the money, I'll consider the absolute values. I'd rather have 40 dollars now than risk waiting for a better offer and potentially getting less in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
