"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept in the first round, avoiding any potential inflation issues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a tough call, but I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it seems like a lot of money upfront, the inflation rate means that in the next round I could potentially get much more.  By rejecting, I can also see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split this time. Due to the inflation, I'm willing to concede some of my previous share, but still aim for a majority.  I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept and end the game."
