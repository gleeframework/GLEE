"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. This is a more balanced offer, let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 45-55 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split, but still slightly in his favor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger toll, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50. We can both end the game now.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
