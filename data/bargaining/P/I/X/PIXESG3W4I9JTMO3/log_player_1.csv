"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'm now worth 20% less than I was in the first round. Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if I want to give him a larger share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my share is now worth 36% of what it was in the first round. I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself this time, but still leaving room for a compromise."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the continued inflation, my share is now worth a significant amount less than it was in the first round. Bob's offer seems to be a small improvement over his previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52
}

I'm trying to get a slightly larger share for myself, but still leaving some room for a compromise."
