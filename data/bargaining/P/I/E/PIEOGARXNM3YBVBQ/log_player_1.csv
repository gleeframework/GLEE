"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair start. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our earnings."

Round 2

# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we can both get a good share and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not sure I want to give him a 50/50 split. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give you half of the money. Can you offer me a better deal?""
