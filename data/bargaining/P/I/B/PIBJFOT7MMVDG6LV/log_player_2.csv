"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer sounds fair at first glance, the inflation heavily favors her in this scenario.  Here's why:

* **My diminishing returns:**  My money loses value much faster than hers. Every round I wait, my potential earnings decrease significantly.
* **Her advantage over time:** Alice can afford to be more patient. Even if my share is larger in the early rounds, hers will be worth significantly more in later rounds due to the difference in inflation rates.

It's crucial to push for a more advantageous split in the early rounds to offset the impact of inflation."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand the need for a fair split considering inflation, but your initial offer disadvantages me significantly in the long run. Let's adjust the split to reflect the faster devaluation of my share."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer flips the initial proposal, giving me a larger share upfront to compensate for the rapid inflation working against me. It's still a reasonable starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise in subsequent rounds. By highlighting the impact of inflation on my share, I'm hoping Alice will be receptive to a more balanced agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I've adjusted the split. This should be more reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has slightly improved, it's not enough to offset the impact of inflation on my potential earnings. The gap between our shares is still too wide, and accepting now would leave me at a significant disadvantage, even with her adjusted split. 

We're approaching a critical point in the negotiations where the diminishing value of the money will start to outweigh the potential gains from further negotiation. It's time to stand firm and signal I'm willing to risk it all for a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. This offer acknowledges the need for a split that considers the inflation, but also ensures a fair outcome for me despite the rapid devaluation of my share.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  We're running out of time, and each round makes the diminishing value of the money a bigger factor. 
* **Compromise:** This offer is a significant move from my previous proposal, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.  
* **Fairness:**  A 55/45 split feels like a reasonable middle ground at this stage, considering the inflation disparity.

This proposal aims to strike a balance between securing a reasonable share and urging Alice to finalize a deal before the value of the money erodes further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet halfway on the previous offers, we're running out of time. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation. While Alice's offer is tempting (it's the average of our last offers, and time is running out), it's still structurally disadvantageous to me due to the inflation difference. Accepting now would mean losing out on a significant sum compared to what I could have gained in earlier rounds. 

My rejections are clearly pushing Alice towards a more balanced split, and we're approaching a point where she'll need to make a substantial concession to avoid walking away with nothing. The risk is high, but so is the potential reward for holding out a little longer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're incredibly close to a deal, but we need to act decisively. This is my final offer - it's a fair compromise that acknowledges the time pressure while ensuring we both benefit. Let's close this out and avoid losing everything.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  It's time to draw a line in the sand. By presenting this as my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to make a decision. 
* **Slight Concession:** I'm moving slightly closer to her offer from Round 5, showing willingness to compromise but not at the cost of a significantly imbalanced deal. 
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the rapidly approaching deadline and the risk of both sides getting nothing.

This is a calculated risk. It's possible Alice might call my bluff, but it's also very likely that the fear of reaching round 12 with no agreement will push her to accept this reasonably balanced offer."
