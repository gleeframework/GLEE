"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 60/40 split, especially considering the money is worth 10% less now. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being a bit stubborn. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 45/55 split, especially considering the money is worth even less now due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

```
{
