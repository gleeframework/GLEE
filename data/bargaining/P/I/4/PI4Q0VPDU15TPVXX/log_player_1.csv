"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

I think Bob is being a bit greedy, but I'll consider the offer. I'll reject it for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll try to give Bob a slightly smaller share to make up for his initial greed.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more, now you'll get a bit less. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. You're going to have to give me more. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of Bob's share, I'm not too concerned about giving him a slightly larger share this time. However, I'm still not willing to give him the majority of the money.

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will start to get more realistic about the division.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth the same for me, but Bob's share is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. I'll give him a smaller share, but I'll also make it clear that I'm not willing to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""

# Bob's message: I'm not going to settle for this. I want a bigger share. You're going to have to give me more. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of Bob's share, I'm not too concerned about giving him a larger share this time. However, I'm starting to get worried that I might not get a good deal if I reject this offer, since the money is worth less for me with each passing round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can still get a decent share of the money.
