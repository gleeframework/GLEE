"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm leaving room for negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'm not too thrilled about taking only 30$, but I'll consider it. However, I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
