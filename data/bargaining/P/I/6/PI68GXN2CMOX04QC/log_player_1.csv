"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $36.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, considering I was willing to give him 50% in the first round. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

  ""message"": ""Not a good offer, I'll make a counter-proposal""

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $30 is worth 72.9% of its original value from the first round, which is 72.9% of $50, or $36.45.

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is a good deal, considering he's getting a larger share and I'm getting less than I was initially willing to give him. I'll reject this offer.
