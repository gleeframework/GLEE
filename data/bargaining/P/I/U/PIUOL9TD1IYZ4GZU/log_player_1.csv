"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message to Bob is that this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the next offer 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75-25 split, especially since I'm the one who made the first offer and tried to be generous. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. My message to Bob is that I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of making the next offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, Bob's offer is now even more skewed in his favor. I'll reject his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, it's only fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting $5,000 and Bob getting $5,000. My message to Bob is that it's only fair to split the money equally, considering the decreasing value of the money with each round."
