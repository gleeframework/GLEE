"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I'll take 60% this time, and you can have 40%.  It's only fair! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to turn the tables!

I'll have to think carefully about this... With the 20% inflation, the $400,000 I'd get is actually worth $320,000 in real terms, while Bob would get $480,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a worse deal than my original proposal, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation.
