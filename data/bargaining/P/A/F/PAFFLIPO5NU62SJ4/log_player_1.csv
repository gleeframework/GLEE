"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less than the previous round, so I'll have to think carefully about the proposal.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up the chance to negotiate further.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less than the previous round, so I'll have to be strategic about my offer.

I'll propose a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split given the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more to Alice, but I think this is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's a slightly better split than my previous offer, I'm still not sure if it's enough to compensate for the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 48.8% less than the first round, which is a significant hit due to inflation. I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer to compensate for the reduced value.

I'll propose a 70-30 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than my previous offers. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Given the inflation, I think I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think this is as high as I can go. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the drastic decrease in the value of my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's a bit better than the 50-50 split Bob proposed earlier, I'm not sure if it's enough to compensate for the massive loss in value.

However, I'm also aware that if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of waiting against the potential costs of inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
