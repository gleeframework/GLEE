"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation risk. I'll take a bit more since I lose value faster. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal!  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation rate. You'll lose value faster, but I'm still willing to give you more than half.  Let's end this game!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering we both lose value, and I lose more, I'll take a bit more but still offer you a considerable amount. Let's settle! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is better than what I proposed last round, and the inflation is starting to hurt. Let's end this game."
