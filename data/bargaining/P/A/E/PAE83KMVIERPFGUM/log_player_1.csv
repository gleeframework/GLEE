"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit unfair, Alice. Let's be reasonable. I'll take 70, you take 30. This accounts for the time value of money with the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
