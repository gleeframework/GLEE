"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10, a fair and generous offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. How about we split it 80-20? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled about giving up 80% of the money, but I don't want to risk going to another round either. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 20% and call it a day!"
