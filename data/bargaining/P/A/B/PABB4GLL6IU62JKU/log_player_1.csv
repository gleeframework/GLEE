Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you 200,000$. I'm keeping the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount to get the game started."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation continuing, I'll try to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm keeping a larger share of the money, but still offering you a significant amount."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'm getting more desperate. Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to Round 5 with even less value in the money.

I'll accept this offer.
