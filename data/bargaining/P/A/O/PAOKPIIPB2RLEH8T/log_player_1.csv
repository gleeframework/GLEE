"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you $1000 and keep $9000. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

This offer is generous, but I'm hoping Bob will be eager to get some money and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy! I'll give you a fair share this time. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to reject my offer, and now it's my turn to make a decision on his counteroffer.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 2000$ I'll get, considering the inflation. I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take 7500 and let me have 2500. It's a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more reasonable this time, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm still not impressed. Try harder next time! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a low offer, considering the value of money has decreased so much. I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. 50/50. It's the fairest way, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more reasonable and fair this time, taking into account the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but not too much. You're getting close to desperation! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting desperate, but I'm not giving up yet!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that's still slightly biased towards Bob, considering the inflation. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a smaller share. Take 4000 and let me have 6000. It's my last chance to get a good deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but I'm also aware that I might be running out of time and options."
