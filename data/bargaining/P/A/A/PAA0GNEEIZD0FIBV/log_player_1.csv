I'm going to offer a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the one making the proposal, I'm going to try and get the most I can. But I also don't want to risk Bob rejecting the offer and potentially getting a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While a 70/30 split isn't ideal, it's still better than the potential outcome of rejecting and risking Bob getting a better deal in the next round. The inflation factor is also working against me, so I'd be wise to accept this offer and secure some of the money before it's worth even less."
