**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly stubborn, but her losses to inflation are mounting rapidly. While her offer isn't terrible in absolute terms, it's highly likely she'll be forced to be much more reasonable soon. We're still in a good position to push for a better deal."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 680000, ""alice_gain"": 320000, ""message"": ""Alice, you're hurting yourself more than me.  Let's be sensible and end this.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We need to keep applying pressure, but a slight increase from the previous round shows we're willing to negotiate. Alice should be feeling the heat with inflation now severely impacting her potential gains. This offer represents a good balance between maximizing our share and increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting before she loses even more to inflation."
