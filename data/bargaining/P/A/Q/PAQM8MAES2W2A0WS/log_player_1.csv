Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. Let's start with a more balanced 55/45, and see where we go from there. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 55-45 split. I was hoping for a more significant difference in our gains. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. I'll take 70 and you can have 30. It's a fair reflection of my negotiating skills.""}

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my proposal, hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to reach a more equitable solution. 40/60 seems like a fair compromise given the current circumstances. I think it's better to reach an agreement now than to risk getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to get a bit desperate, and Bob's message about reaching an agreement now rather than risking getting nothing at all resonates with me. I think 40/60 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid going to zero."
