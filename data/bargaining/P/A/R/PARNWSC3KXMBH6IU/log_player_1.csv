"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm taking almost all of the money in this first round!  I'm hoping Bob will be too surprised to reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm taking a big hit on the value of the money, but it's still better than getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other.  I'll take the $300,000 and be done with this."
