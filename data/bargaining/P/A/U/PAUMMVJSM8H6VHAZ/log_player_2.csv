Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share.  However, with inflation eating at our potential gains, we need to find a compromise quickly. 55/45 is a strong offer, and closer to my original proposal. Let's close this deal and both walk away winners. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
