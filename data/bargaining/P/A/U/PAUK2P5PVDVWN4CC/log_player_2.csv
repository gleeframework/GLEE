Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about the value decreasing, she's still not offering a fair deal adjusted for inflation. I need to push for a more even split while I still have some negotiating power.  It's getting risky, but holding out might make her budge closer to 50/50."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing a lot, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting incredibly risky now.  While this isn't a fair split in terms of the original value, the impact of inflation is too severe to ignore. Accepting a 44/56 split is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
