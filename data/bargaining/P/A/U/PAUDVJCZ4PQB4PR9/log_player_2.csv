"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A 50/50 split, no more negotiations! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking further inflation and getting a worse deal in the next round."
