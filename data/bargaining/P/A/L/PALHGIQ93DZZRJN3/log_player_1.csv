Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""A fair starting point, let's see if you can do better!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm sure we can find a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm getting only 40% of the remaining money, which is even less than in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
