Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's important we settle this now as the value is decreasing rapidly for both of us, especially you. Let's be practical and finalize the deal. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough decision, but accepting is the more logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each round. By round 4, you're losing almost half the value of any potential gain compared to round 1.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has labeled this as his ""final offer."" While it's a negotiation tactic, it indicates he might be unwilling to move much further, especially towards a deal more favorable to you.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in Round 5 is very risky. Bob might offer even less, and the value will further decrease, potentially leaving you with even less than what you're getting now.

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 cuts your losses and guarantees you a reasonable share before inflation eats further into the potential gains."
