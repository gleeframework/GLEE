"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very uneven split.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but if not, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A fair split is always a good outcome."
