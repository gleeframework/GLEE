"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  Since I'm making the first offer, I'm trying to get the largest share possible while still giving Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation means my share is shrinking with each round. Accepting this offer guarantees me $5,000, whereas rejecting it risks getting nothing at all in the next round."
