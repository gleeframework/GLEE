"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair offer, but I'm starting with a slight bias towards myself, as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $5700 in the first round's money.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
