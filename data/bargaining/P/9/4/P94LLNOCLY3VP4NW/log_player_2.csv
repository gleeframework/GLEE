Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer. Here's my proposal for Round 2:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}

This is a more favorable split for me, but I'm still willing to compromise."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 20 is actually equivalent to 13.44 in the first round, which is a relatively small amount. I'll accept this offer to avoid losing more value in future rounds.
