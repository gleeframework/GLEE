"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself slightly. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While 70 dollars is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for such a drastic reduction in my share after my initial proposal. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share slightly to 80, hoping to find a middle ground that Bob will accept. I believe this is a fair compromise, given the decreasing value of the money."
