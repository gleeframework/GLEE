"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a generous offer, giving me 60% of the initial $1,000,000. Will Bob accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to flip the script, huh?

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me less than I initially offered. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is taking a toll, and my offer will be worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, taking into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation. Will Bob accept?"
