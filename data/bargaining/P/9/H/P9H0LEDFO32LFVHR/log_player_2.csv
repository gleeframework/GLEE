"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your offer wasn't realistic considering the inflation working against you. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split. It's a slight concession on my part, and it ensures we both walk away with a significant amount before the money loses too much value. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000
