525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your offer wasn't realistic considering the inflation working against you. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split. It's a slight concession on my part, and it ensures we both walk away with a significant amount before the money loses too much value.",Alice,3,
