"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and keep the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90% to 10% split in my favor, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest way to do it, and it avoids any potential for conflict. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a reasonable one, especially since it's an even split. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal considering the inflation factor. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting $500,000, which is worth 80% of what I would have gotten in the first round ($600,000). I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round.
