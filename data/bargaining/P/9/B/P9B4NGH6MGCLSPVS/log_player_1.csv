I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can get this over with quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is ridiculously unfair, and even though I'm losing value on my money with each round, I'd rather risk getting a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still hoping to get a good deal, but I'm willing to compromise a little bit to avoid another round of inflation."
