"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this one.

After some thought, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to do slightly better.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43}

I'm proposing a 57-43 split, trying to squeeze in a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the offers so far, I'm starting to feel like I need to be more aggressive to get a better deal.

However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk going back to the drawing board.

After some thought, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
