"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to compromise as I was in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the money is worth less now. I'd like to propose another offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You said we should meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial offer was 60-40.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45. I'm framing it as a response to his previous suggestion to meet in the middle, while also subtly implying that I'm entitled to a higher share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 45 is still too low 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth even less for me now, I'm getting more cautious. Since Bob is still offering a 55-45 split, which is the same as his previous offer, I'm not convinced he's willing to give me a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think he's not serious about giving me a better deal. I'd like to propose another offer in the next round to try to get a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less for me now, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 62,
  ""bob_gain"": 38,
  ""message"": ""You're not budging, so I'll take what I can get. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 62-38 split in my favor, with me getting $62 and Bob getting $38. I'm framing it as a ""final offer"" to see if Bob will accept it, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you most of it, but I think 38 is still too low 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth significantly less for me now, I'm starting to get desperate. Bob's offer is a significant increase from his previous offers, and I'm not sure if I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's the best one I've seen so far, and I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting an even worse deal."
