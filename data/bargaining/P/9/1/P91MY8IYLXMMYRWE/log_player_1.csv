"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still leaving you with a decent share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my 2000$ gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 1900$ in ""original"" money. That's not a bad deal, but I'm not sure if I should settle for it.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take a bit less, but I'm not giving up yet""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take a bit less, but still trying to get a decent share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the offer, my 3000$ gain is worth 86.96% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately 1736$ in ""original"" money. It's not a great deal, but I'm not sure if I should push for more.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'll take less to get something""
}
```

I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle."
