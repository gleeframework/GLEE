"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous offer considering we're in the first round. I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's not waste any more time with trivial offers. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round, and I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value due to inflation. Bob's offer is not generous enough, considering he's trying to rush the game. I want to make a counteroffer and try to get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm making a counteroffer that is closer to the middle, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is trying to rush the game. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm still prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A fair split before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant loss of value due to inflation, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is fair, and further negotiations would likely result in even greater losses due to inflation. By accepting this offer, I'm securing a decent share of the remaining value."
