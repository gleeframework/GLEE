"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiation.""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can both be happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather have a smaller share now than risk getting an even smaller share later. I'll accept the offer.
