"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. It's a good starting point, but I think I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice counters with."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair. Let's agree and move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, the inflation is starting to hurt.  Accepting this offer guarantees me something, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the end."
