"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this round. But be warned, the money's worth less with each round! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $100,000 now, it's a very small percentage of the total.  It's worth risking one round to see if Alice will be willing to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid the inflation risk.""
