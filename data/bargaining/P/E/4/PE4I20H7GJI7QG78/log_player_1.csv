"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money and can end the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly better offer, but I'm still open to negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $500,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $450,000.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $480,000 is now worth 73.9% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately $739,000. This is a relatively better deal than the previous round, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my target is to get a higher share to compensate for the decreased value of money. I'll aim for a larger share to make up for the lost value. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a bigger share to account for the inflation.""

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $520,000 is now worth 52.05% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately $520,000. This is a relatively decent deal, considering the inflation.
