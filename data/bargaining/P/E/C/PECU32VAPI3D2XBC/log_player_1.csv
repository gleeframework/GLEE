"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of the money, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
