Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to be fair, huh? Well, I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the effective value of the offer:

My gain: 250,000
Effective value after inflation: 250,000 / 0.95 = 263,157.89

Not bad, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for this. I'll reject the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the effective value of the offer:

Effective value after inflation: 400,000 / 0.8587 (1 - 0.1426) = 465,511.21

Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to meet at the new middle! I'll consider his offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 30.17% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the effective value of the offer:

My gain: 500,000
Effective value after inflation: 500,000 / 0.6979 (1 - 0.3017) = 716,511.53

Hmm, this is a good offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for this. It's a 50/50 split, but the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll think about it...

Wait, this is the 8th round, and we have 4 rounds left. If we don't make a deal now, the money will be worth even less. I'll take the offer.
