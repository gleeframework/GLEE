"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, it's still better than nothing! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd get $200,000 and Bob would get $800,000. Considering the inflation, Bob's share is actually worth more than mine, but I'd rather not be greedy. I'll accept this offer.
