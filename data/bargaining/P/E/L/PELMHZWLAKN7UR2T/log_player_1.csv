Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less to Bob each round, I'm hoping he'll take this deal to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to try and incentivize Bob to accept.  I'm still hoping he'll see that he'll lose even more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still pretty bad, but with the inflation, I'm getting a much lower value for my share and Bob's value is significantly lower than before. It's better to take this deal than to risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
