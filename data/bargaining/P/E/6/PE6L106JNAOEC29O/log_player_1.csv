I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the deal quickly. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm giving him a decent amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is quite a bit less than what I was initially offering him. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still keeping it at a point where it's more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping that by demonstrating flexibility, I can get Bob to accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I initially proposed, but I think I can still do better. Inflation is hitting me harder, but I'm confident I can secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 576000, ""bob_gain"": 424000}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but I'm aiming for a compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of getting something, rather than risking getting nothing as we approach the end of the rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a better deal than the last one I offered. I'm accepting, but I'm not happy about how much inflation has eaten into my profits."
