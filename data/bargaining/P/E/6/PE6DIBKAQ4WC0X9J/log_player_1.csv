"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a 60-40 split, with me taking the larger share this time. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to reverse the split!

I'll reject his offer for now. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split in his favor, I'll try to counter with a 55-45 split in my favor. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more for being the one making the first offer!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. 55-45 split seems fair considering the inflation.  It's better than the previous offers, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle!

However, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject his offer and try to get an even better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to squeeze out a bit more. Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the risks of inflation!""
