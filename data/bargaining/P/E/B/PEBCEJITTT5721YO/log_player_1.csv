"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too favorable towards you.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This accounts for the time value of money, as delaying the agreement costs us both. Let's close this out and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
