Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking $9000, leaving $1000 for Bob. This feels fair as it's a significant portion of the money and leaves some for Bob. I'm confident he'll accept this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While the money is worth less now due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to try to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $7000 for me and $3000 for Bob. While Bob's offer was tempting, I believe I can still get a better deal than $1000.  I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him, considering the declining value of money due to inflation."
