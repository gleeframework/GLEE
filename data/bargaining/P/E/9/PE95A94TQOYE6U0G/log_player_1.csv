"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, I'll get $500,000, which is worth 90% of the original $600,000 I was offered in the first round. That's a decent deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000, and I'll take the remaining $550,000. Let's see if you'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Let's calculate the actual value of the money I'd gain in this round. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll get $480,000, which is worth 72.9% of the original $600,000 I was offered in the first round.

That's a decent deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it...

After some consideration, I'll accept Bob's offer.
