Round 2

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an interesting offer!

I'll reject it. I don't think I should get only 40% of the money just because Bob proposed first. I think I deserve a bigger share.

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, that's a pretty extreme offer from Bob! I don't think I'm being greedy, but I do think that offer is a bit unfair. I'm not going to accept an offer where I get only 10% of the money.

# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle now. I'm not thrilled about getting only 25% of the money, but I think it's a slightly more reasonable offer than the last one.
