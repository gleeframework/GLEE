"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While the offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation factor. As Bob, I'm only losing 10% per round, so I can afford to be a bit more greedy. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. It's a good compromise, and we both get a decent share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I think this is a reasonable adjustment 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation rates. My gain is worth less than in the first round, so accepting this deal makes more sense than risking further negotiation."
