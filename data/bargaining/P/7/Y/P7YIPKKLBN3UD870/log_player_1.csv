"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, I'm not sure I want to accept this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, considering the inflation is still affecting the money's value. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
