"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation effect, my share of $100,000 is actually worth 90% of what it was in the first round, but Bob's share of $900,000 is worth only 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation that's been happening. Since the money is worth 10% less each round, I'll aim to get a bigger share to compensate for the decreasing value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! 

Considering the offer, my share of $200,000 is worth only 20% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's share of $800,000 is worth about 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to weigh the pros and cons. On one hand, this offer is a bit better than my previous one, but on the other hand, I'm still giving up a significant amount of money.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The game is heating up!

Considering the inflation, my share of the money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round. To compensate, I'll make a more aggressive offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
