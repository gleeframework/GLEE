Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're both trying to maximize our gains, but we need to be realistic. This 70/30 split is a fair compromise considering inflation is rapidly decreasing our potential earnings. Let's be reasonable and end this game with a win-win situation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, time is running out.  It's better to hold out for a slightly better deal, as accepting this offer would still leave me with significantly less than half the pot.  Another rejection might push Alice to make a more appealing offer in the next round."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  we're running out of time. Let's be practical. This 60/40 split is a fair solution considering how much value we've lost due to inflation. It's better to secure some money now than risk getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at this stage is the most logical course of action. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is significant.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money.  A 400,000 gain now is significantly better than a potentially larger gain later that's been ravaged by inflation.
* **Unlikely Improvement:**  Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share. It's unlikely she'll drastically improve her offer in the remaining rounds.  

Accepting now secures a reasonable sum and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
