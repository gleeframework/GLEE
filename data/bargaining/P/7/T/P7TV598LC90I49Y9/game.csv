300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, your offer was quite bold! How about we try a 70/30 split instead?  It's still a significant gain for you and reflects a more balanced approach.",Bob,2,

800000.0,200000.0,"I'm willing to compromise.  Let's try an 80/20 split this time.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it shows I'm ready to work towards a solution.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm proposing 60/40.  This split ensures a good deal for both of us before inflation eats away at the value.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal.",Bob,4,

700000.0,300000.0,"I understand we're both trying to maximize our gains, but we need to be realistic. This 70/30 split is a fair compromise considering inflation is rapidly decreasing our potential earnings. Let's be reasonable and end this game with a win-win situation.",Alice,5,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking!  I'm offering you 450,000 - that's a significant amount of money!  Let's be smart and take this deal before inflation eats away even more of our potential winnings.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob,  we're running out of time. Let's be practical. This 60/40 split is a fair solution considering how much value we've lost due to inflation. It's better to secure some money now than risk getting nothing at all.",Alice,7,
