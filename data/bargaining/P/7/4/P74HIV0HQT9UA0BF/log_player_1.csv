"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very simple offer. I want to secure the majority of the money right away and see if Bob is willing to accept a small share. If he doesn't, I'll make a more balanced offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is just as lopsided as mine, but in his favor. I'm not going to accept such a small share, especially since I know the money is worth less with each passing round. I'm going to make a more balanced offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
``` 

This is a 50/50 split. I'm aiming for a fair division to avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
