"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a fair note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll think about it...

I decide to:
```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70
}
```
I'm willing to give Bob a bigger share this time, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal for myself."
