"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm willing to give Bob a higher share in the first round to set a good tone for the negotiations."

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it 50/50, huh? That's a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is taking its toll! The money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer, taking that into account. Here it is:
