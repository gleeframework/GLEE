"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially since the money is losing value with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle. Let's try to find a fair split 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd still like to get a bit more, the value of the money is quickly decreasing, and a 50/50 split is a fair compromise.  It's better than risking getting nothing at all."
