Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you one last chance. With this inflation, you're losing a lot. Don't be stubborn. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While the offer is still not ideal, the inflation is hitting hard. Accepting now ensures I get *something* and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all in the next round."
