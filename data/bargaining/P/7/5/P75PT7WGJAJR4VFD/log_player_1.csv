"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:\n\n

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

In this offer, I propose to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. I've also included a message to Bob suggesting that we split the money fairly, taking into account the inflation that will reduce the value of the money in subsequent rounds. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation affects me more, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile.  This offer is still generous to you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll respond with a decision in JSON format:


```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation affecting him more, I believe I can get a better deal considering the money is worth the same to me as in the first round. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:


```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact on your share, this is a reasonable adjustment""
}
```

In this offer, I've increased my share to $6,500 and decreased Bob's share to $3,500, citing the growing impact of inflation on his portion as justification. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is significantly impacting my share.  This is my final offer to try and find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this deal to ensure we both get a share of the money, rather than risking further rounds and potentially getting nothing."
