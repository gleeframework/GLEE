# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal than this, so I'll reject the offer.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The inflation is eating away at our potential gains. Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I think I've pushed my luck far enough, and the inflation is starting to hurt me significantly as well. A 50/50 split seems like a reasonable deal at this point, especially considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's call it a day!"
