"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing to take $60 and let Bob have $40. I think this is a fair starting point, given that the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, accepting this offer is better than risking a further decrease in the value of the money."
