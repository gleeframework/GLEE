"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for both of us to secure a good deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer heavily favors you. Let's be more equitable. This offer leaves us both with a significant sum.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but time is working against us both. This offer is a compromise, and I urge you to consider it carefully. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation more acutely than Bob.  While her offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Bob can likely leverage this pressure to his advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is slipping away with each round. This offer is my final compromise â€“ it ensures a fairer split while still leaving us both with a worthwhile amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a critical point in our negotiation.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to reach a deal.  Let's be pragmatic and avoid losing even more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but ultimately accepting is the best choice for Bob now:

* **Alice is feeling the pressure:**  Her offer has finally tipped in Bob's favor, even if only slightly. The rapid devaluation on her end is clearly motivating her.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a drastically better offer in the remaining rounds is very risky.  Bob might get greedy and end up with nothing if they don't reach an agreement.
* **This offer is decent:** While not ideal, 525,000 is still a significant amount of money. It's better to secure a win now than gamble on a potentially larger, but riskier, win later."
