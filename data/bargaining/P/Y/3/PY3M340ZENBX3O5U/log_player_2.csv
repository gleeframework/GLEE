Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, think about the inflation 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is right that we need to consider inflation, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. The deal is getting worse for me with each round that passes. I need to push for a more agreeable split quickly, or I risk getting even less in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Inflation is eating my share fast. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I need to apply more pressure. By stating this is my final offer, I create a sense of urgency. Alice might be more inclined to accept a slightly less favorable deal now rather than risk me accepting a worse deal for her in the later rounds (due to inflation heavily impacting my gains)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have thought of that earlier 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing hardball, and my position is weakening rapidly due to inflation.  While this offer isn't ideal, accepting now is better than risking even less in subsequent rounds. If I reject, there's a good chance she'll continue to offer me even less, and I'll be forced to accept an even worse deal or walk away with nothing."
