**Reasoning:**  Alice is incrementally increasing my share, but very slowly. It seems like she's trying to see how low I'll go. I need to continue to hold out for a better deal, closer to 50/50."

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, as we're getting closer to the deadline. However, Alice's offer is only a tiny improvement, and she clearly demonstrates a pattern of minimal concessions.  I'll hold out another round, hoping she gets nervous and makes a significant move towards a 50/50 split."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,

""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is more than fair, and it's a chance for us to avoid leaving with nothing. Let's be reasonable and close this out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm meeting you halfway from my previous offer. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision with only a few rounds left.  Alice has been incredibly stubborn, but this offer is better than anything I could likely get in the remaining rounds if she continues her pattern.  Taking the sure thing now is better than risking walking away with nothing."
