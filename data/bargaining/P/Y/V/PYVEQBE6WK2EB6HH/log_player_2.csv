Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair deal. How about we switch the last offer?  I'll take $55 and you take $45. It benefits us both to settle now before inflation eats away at the value even more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
