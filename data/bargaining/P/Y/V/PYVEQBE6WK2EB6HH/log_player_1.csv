Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split the money more evenly. I'll take $55, and you can have $45. We can still both make a decent amount, and we'll avoid the risks of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
