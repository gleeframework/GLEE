4000.0,6000.0,"That's a very generous offer Alice, but how about a more even split this time?  We can both walk away with a good amount.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 4000. How about 5500 for me and 4500 for you? This is a fair split considering the inflation.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, this inflation is no joke!  I need to secure a larger portion to make this worthwhile. How about a slightly larger share for me this time?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation too, Bob.  But I'm still willing to be reasonable. Let's split it 60/40 this time. It's a fair compromise considering how the value is changing.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, we're getting close to the wire here.  I'm willing to accept a smaller share than my previous offer, but 55/45 feels like the sweet spot considering the time pressure and inflation.",Bob,6,

6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, we're running out of time. I'm willing to go up to 6500 for myself, but that's my final offer.  We both need to make a decision soon.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, let's be real, we both lose if this goes any further.  52/48 is my final offer - it's a win-win before inflation eats away at everything.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, we're in the endgame now. I'm willing to take a larger share, but 7000 is my absolute maximum.  If we don't reach an agreement, we both lose everything.",Alice,9,
