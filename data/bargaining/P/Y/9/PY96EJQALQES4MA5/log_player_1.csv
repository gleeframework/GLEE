"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a straightforward and fair division of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% of the total, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiation skills 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a bold move by Bob!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 20% is a fair share, especially considering I'm the one who made the first offer and took the risk of being rejected. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share for my patience and persistence.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer by $100,000, giving Bob 400,000, but still keeping a slightly larger share for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small consolation prize, but I'm taking the majority of the pie 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, that's a pretty lowball offer from Bob!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 10% share of the pie, especially after I've already made two offers and been rejected. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I've been patient enough. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, giving Bob a 300,000 share, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. It's time for Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking the majority of the pie, but I'll give you a tiny slice as a consolation 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a very low offer from Bob!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 0.5% share of the pie. I think I've been patient enough and made reasonable offers, and I'm not going to accept a paltry sum like $50,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm not willing to be taken advantage of. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 85% of the pie, and giving Bob a small 15% share. I'm trying to be generous, but I'm also being firm and standing my ground. It's time for Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
