Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on Bob, don't be stingy! You're losing value every round.

# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. The money is losing value for you, not me. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing significantly with each round.  Delaying further only hurts Bob.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice seems to be playing hardball and is aware of Bob's disadvantage.  It's unlikely she will offer a deal significantly better than this one.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in a future round carries a substantial risk. The potential loss from inflation outweighs the potential gain from a slightly improved split. 

While $430,000 is significantly less than what Bob could have gotten in earlier rounds, it's better to secure this amount now than risk getting even less later."
