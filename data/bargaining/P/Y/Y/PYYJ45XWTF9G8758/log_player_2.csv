Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about we try a 70/30 split this time? It accounts for the inflation we'll both face.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 70/30 split is still too one-sided. Let's go for a 45/55 split this time. It's more balanced and acknowledges the inflation we're both experiencing. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
