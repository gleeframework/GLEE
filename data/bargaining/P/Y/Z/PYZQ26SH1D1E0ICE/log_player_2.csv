Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the pot is shrinking.  I'm meeting you halfway from my original offer. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'm happy to take this offer.  The money is losing value quickly and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
