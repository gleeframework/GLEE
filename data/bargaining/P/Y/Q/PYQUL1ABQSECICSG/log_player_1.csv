"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure why Bob thinks a 50:50 split is fair, considering the initial amount is $100. I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is getting worse!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous last time, Bob. This is a more reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 60:40, trying to account for the inflation and get a better share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer for both of us. Let's end this game and get our money! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think a 40:60 split is fair, especially considering the initial amount is $100. I'm not willing to accept a worse deal than what I offered in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really hurting my wallet!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I think this is the best I can do. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55:45, trying to get a slightly better share for myself, but I'm not sure if it's enough."
