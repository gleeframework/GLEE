Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'll take 550,000 and you get 450,000.  This way, we both get a decent share, and we can end this before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gains.

# Alice gain: 550000
