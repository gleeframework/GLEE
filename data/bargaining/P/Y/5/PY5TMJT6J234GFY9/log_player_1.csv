Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 58

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching up his share very slowly, taking advantage of my losses to inflation.  It's still early in the game, and I need to show him I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the circumstances.  Let's end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to make a strong move.  Offering a 50/50 split:

* **Highlights fairness:**  It directly addresses the growing imbalance caused by inflation.
* **Creates pressure:** Bob might be less likely to risk further rounds where my share diminishes, potentially leaving him with a worse deal in the end. 
* **Shows resolve:** It demonstrates I'm serious about getting a reasonable outcome and not easily exploited."
