"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a classic game theory scenario similar to the Ultimatum Game.  While unfair on the surface, rejecting this offer sets a precedent and gives me more bargaining power in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. Rejecting it signals I'm not easily swayed by unfair propositions. 
* **Time Pressure:** The value of the money decreases with each round *for me*. I need to push for a better deal sooner rather than later.
* **Appearance of Compromise:** Offering Alice slightly more than I initially rejected (45 vs. 40) makes it seem like I'm willing to negotiate, potentially making her more amenable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll lower my share a bit, but not too much 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Change:** Alice's offer only increased my potential gain by $2. This suggests she's not truly willing to negotiate fairly.
* **Inflation Impact:** While $42 is better than nothing, the decreasing value of the money makes this offer increasingly unappealing as time goes on.
* **Strategic Holdout:** By continuing to reject, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. She knows that if we don't reach an agreement, we both lose. 

I'm betting that Alice will be forced to make a more substantial offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Let's end this before we both lose out.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadline Pressure:** We are now past the halfway point. The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. 
* **Firm Stance:**  Offering a 50/50 split is fair and demonstrates I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Ultimatum:** By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. She now knows that I'm not willing to budge further and that her choice is between accepting a fair deal or risking everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give in a bit more, but 50/50 is not for me 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, waiting any longer significantly hurts me due to the inflation. Accepting $43 is better than risking getting nothing at all if Alice continues to be stubborn.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Her message suggests she's unlikely to agree to a 50/50 split. Accepting this offer cuts my losses.
* **Risk Aversion:**  Continuing to play is risky.  I have no guarantee Alice will offer me anything better, and the value of any potential future offers will be diminished by inflation."
