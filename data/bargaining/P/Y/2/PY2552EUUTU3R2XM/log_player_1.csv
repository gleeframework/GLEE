"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to take a slightly larger share this time, but I believe a more equitable split is possible. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the $10,000 is now worth less to me. I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer. I think I can do better than this, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for the next round to make my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is the best I can do considering the inflation. Let's see if you'll accept!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting $4,200 and Bob getting $5,800. I'm hoping this is more to Bob's liking."
