"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, I'd rather wait for a better offer. I'll reject this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the reduced value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping it's more attractive than his previous offer."
