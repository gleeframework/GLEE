I'm going to propose a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor. I figure I can take a big chunk now and still leave Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to offer 810,000 for myself and 190,000 for Bob. While my share is lower than the previous round due to inflation, it's still a significant amount. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as the next round will only further decrease the value of my offer."
