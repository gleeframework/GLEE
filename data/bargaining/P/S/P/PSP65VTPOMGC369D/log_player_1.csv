"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Your turn!""
}
```

This offer suggests that I, Alice, would receive $70 and Bob would receive $30. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his own proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided offer from Bob!

I'll reject it:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
My turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. Your turn again!""
}
```

This offer suggests a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable compromise."
