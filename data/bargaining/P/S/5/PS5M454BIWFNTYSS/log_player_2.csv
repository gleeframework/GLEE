"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money this round, but we can negotiate a more even split later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice is suggesting a more even split later, there's no guarantee of that. Bob needs to hold out for a much better offer in the early rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""This is a strong opening offer, Alice. It gives me a slight advantage recognizing the time pressure, but still leaves you with a substantial sum. Let's close this out and avoid further losses to inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up much more.  Let's split this more fairly and avoid further losses to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is using the threat of inflation against Bob, but she's still taking the lion's share.  Bob needs to hold strong and aim for a closer split, even with the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We're past the halfway point and the clock is ticking. This offer is a compromise - a slight advantage to me to reflect the time pressure, but still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's settle this now."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's call it even. This is a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation. We both get a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is as good as it's going to get for Bob.  A 50/50 split is fair, and waiting any longer will only erode his potential gains due to inflation."
