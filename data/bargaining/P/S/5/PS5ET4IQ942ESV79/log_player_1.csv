I'm going to be greedy in the first round!  I'll propose taking $9,000 and giving Bob $1,000.  I want to see if he'll accept a low offer, or if he'll risk it all for a chance to get more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep playing and try to get a better deal, I need to consider the inflation. Even though I'm losing 20% of the value of my potential gain, I'm still getting $1,000. It's better to take what I can get now, rather than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
