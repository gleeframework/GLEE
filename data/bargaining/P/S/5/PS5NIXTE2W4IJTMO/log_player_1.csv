"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm making a fair and straightforward offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. It's still a good deal, considering the inflation risk! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slight edge due to the inflation risk.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I get a bit more than Bob, considering the decreasing value of money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slight edge due to the inflation risk. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like we're both thinking along the same lines.

Considering the inflation risk and the decreasing value of money, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to meet in the middle and get 48% of the original amount, which is a decent deal considering the circumstances."
