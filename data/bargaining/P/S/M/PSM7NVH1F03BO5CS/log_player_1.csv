"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is my first offer. I'm taking a large portion, but I'm willing to leave Bob with a small share to see if he'll accept. We'll see how the inflation affects our decisions in the future rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer deal than the first offer, and the inflation will make the next round even worse for me. I'll take the 5000."
