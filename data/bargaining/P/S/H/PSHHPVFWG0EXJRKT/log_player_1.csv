"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, a fair share, but I think I deserve more for taking the initiative. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 36 (40 * 0.9) in the new round.

I'm not convinced that I deserve only 40. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 32.4 (36 * 0.9) in the current round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more for being flexible.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this time, but I think I'm being generous considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate my gain in this round. Since the money is worth 10% less each round, and I previously had a gain of 32.4 in the 3rd round, my gain in the 4th round is 23.16 (32.4 * 0.9).

However, I need to consider the 27.1% reduction due to inflation, so my gain in the 4th round is actually 16.8 (23.16 * 0.727).

I'm not happy with this offer, as I think I'm getting a very small share. I'll reject it.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain in the 5th round is 14.74 (16.8 * 0.9).

  ""bob_gain"": 58,
