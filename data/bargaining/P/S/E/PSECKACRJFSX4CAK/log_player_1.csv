Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We've gone back and forth enough. 50-50 is the fairest split. If you reject, I'll know you're not interested in a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  My potential gains are diminishing significantly with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse outcome for me, even if I could secure a slightly better split.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob seems fixated on the 50/50 split and is unlikely to budge.  He's using a ""fairness"" argument that might resonate in later rounds, putting me at a disadvantage. 
* **Certainty:**  Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout. Rejecting risks walking away with nothing if Bob refuses to negotiate further."
