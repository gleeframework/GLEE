"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and leave 100,000 dollars for Bob. This seems fair since I am taking the risk of proposing first, and there's a chance he might reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. Even though the inflation has decreased the value of the money, getting 500,000 dollars is better than risking getting nothing at all in the following rounds."
