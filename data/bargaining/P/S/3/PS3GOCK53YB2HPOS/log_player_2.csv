Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position on inflation, but your previous offer was a bit too much in your favor. This offer is a compromise that still gets us a fair split considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100
