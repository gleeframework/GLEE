Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but here's why I'm accepting:

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation is really hurting.  Getting $3800 now is better than risking even less next round. 
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** She's been consistently offering more and more favorable terms to herself. It's unlikely she'll suddenly offer a better deal.

It's frustrating, but sometimes in negotiations, you have to cut your losses."
