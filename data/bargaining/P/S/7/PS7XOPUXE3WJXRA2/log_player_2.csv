Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more in my favor, but still reasonable. I'll also mention the inflation to put some pressure on Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. The money is worth less to you with each passing round, so let's come to an agreement soon!""}"

Round 3

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that.  This is my final offer before the value of the money drops further for me.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the inflation, Alice's gain is actually worth less than it seems, and I think this is a good deal for me.
