Let's see if Bob agrees with my generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Even though my share is worth 5% less, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal if we go to round 3. I'll need to take inflation into account, but I believe I can propose something more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob $4000, while taking $6000 for myself. This accounts for the inflation, and I believe it's a fair deal. Let's see if he agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my share is worth significantly less due to inflation, this is a 50/50 split, which is better than anything I'm likely to get if I reject and the game continues. I'd rather take the guaranteed $5000 than risk getting even less in the next round."
