"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script - I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor.  We both get a larger share than the initial offer, and we can avoid further rounds and the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
