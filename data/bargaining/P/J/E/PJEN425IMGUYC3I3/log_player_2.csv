Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement, but it seems we both want the bigger piece of the pie.  How about we settle in the middle? 55 for me, 45 for you. It's a fair deal considering the time crunch.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my offer to 52/48.  Let's end this before the inflation eats away at our potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, which is working in my favor. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I believe I can still push for a slightly better outcome in the next couple of rounds.  The risk of holding out is lower than the potential reward of a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I'll agree to 53/47. This meets us near the middle and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing. It's time to be pragmatic.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm nudging my offer up slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm holding firm on getting a slight advantage.  The inflation is hurting her more, so the pressure is on her to accept a less favorable deal. We are also past the halfway point, so emphasizing the risk of getting nothing is becoming a stronger argument."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting absurd.  I'm offering a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but we're running out of time! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally caved to the pressure of the inflation and offered an even split. While I was hoping for a slightly better outcome, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable gain. Holding out any longer risks ending up with nothing, and a 50/50 split is a fair resolution at this point."
