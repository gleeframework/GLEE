60.0,40.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to start.  It benefits us both to settle this quickly.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but it seems we both want the bigger piece of the pie.  How about we settle in the middle? 55 for me, 45 for you. It's a fair deal considering the time crunch.",Bob,4,

47.0,53.0,"Alice, we're getting close. I'll agree to 53/47. This meets us near the middle and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing. It's time to be pragmatic.",Bob,6,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting absurd.  I'm offering a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but we're running out of time!",Alice,7,
