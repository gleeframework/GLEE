"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will agree!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, my proposed gain in the first round would be 5400, but that's not relevant now.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Meeting halfway is a reasonable proposal, but I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll aim for a higher gain to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, Bob. Consider it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're giving me too little, Alice. I'm taking a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is taking a bigger share this time!

Considering the inflation, my initial gain would be worth 60% of the original amount. However, I'll focus on the current situation.

Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure I want to give him a 60% share. I'll try to negotiate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a gain that's more in line with the current value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is my best offer!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $4,200 and Bob gets $5,800. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable compromise."
