"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to make the game worth his while."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, this offer is a more even split than my initial one.
