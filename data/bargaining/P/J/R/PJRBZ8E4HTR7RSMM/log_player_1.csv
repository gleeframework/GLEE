Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. Let's be efficient and reach an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
