"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but I'm willing to negotiate in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, Bob can definitely get a much better deal than $1000, especially considering the money will be worth less in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That's a lot more than I'm willing to start with. How about a more even split? I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but it's still early in the game. Bob has already countered with a better offer, and Alice's inflation isn't as severe.  There's room to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, a compromise.  This is more than fair, and we both lose if we wait much longer.""} 
```"
