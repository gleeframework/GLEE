"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be friends 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice offers in the next round.  While this offer seems tempting, I want to see if I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm hoping for a fair split. Let's start with 60/40 in my favor.  This will account for the inflation we both have to deal with.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's still not ideal, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer gives me a decent amount, and ensures I don't get nothing in the next round."
