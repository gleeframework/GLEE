Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a division that gives me almost all of the money, leaving Bob with just $1. I believe this is a fair offer as it leaves him with something, while maximizing my gain.  Since I'm proposing first, I'm taking the most aggressive approach.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, I think this is a fair and reasonable offer.  It's unlikely Bob will offer me more, and I'm not willing to risk getting nothing by continuing the game."
