Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I understand your position, but I can't accept anything less than this. We're running out of time, and this is a fair compromise considering the circumstances.

Although not ideal, accepting this offer is the safest option at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Bob's offer isn't perfect, the difference in value due to inflation is making each round less profitable. Waiting for a better offer may not be worth the risk.
* **Uncertain Future Offers:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better, and rejecting this could lead to even more unfavorable offers later as the pressure increases. 

Accepting this offer secures a reasonable sum, even with the inflation, and avoids the risk of losing everything in the later rounds."
