"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $950,000
* Bob gain: $950,000

I'm not sure if I want to split the money evenly, as I could potentially get more if I negotiate further. I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal.
