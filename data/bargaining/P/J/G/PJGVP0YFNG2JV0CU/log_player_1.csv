"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob is interested in accepting the offer and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a decent chunk too 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to keep a decent chunk, huh?

I'll have to think about it... With inflation, the 70 I'd get is worth 95% of the original 70, which is $66.50. Not bad, but I could do better, right?

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 80, you can have 20. My turn to dictate the terms""
}
```

I'm making a stronger move this time, offering Bob a smaller share, but still a decent chunk of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much yet 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering the offer, I'd get $60, which is worth 93.74% of the original 50, and Bob would get $40, which is worth 80% of the original 50. It's a decent offer, but I still think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting impatient, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm making another strong move, offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more to get closer to my desired amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still holding out for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting desperate, huh?

Considering the offer, I'd get $75, which is worth 87.5% of the original 50, and Bob would get $25, which is worth 50% of the original 50. It's a decent offer, but I still think I can get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer for now.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, take it or I'll walk""
}
```

I'm making a bold move, offering Bob a tiny share, but I'm getting close to my desired amount. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be left with a significant portion of the money. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... Bob's offering me the same amount I offered him in the last round, but now he's the one making the offer?

Considering the offer, I'd get $90, which is worth 90% of the original 50, and Bob would get $10, which is worth 20% of the original 50. It's a bit suspicious that he's mirroring my previous offer, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept this offer.
