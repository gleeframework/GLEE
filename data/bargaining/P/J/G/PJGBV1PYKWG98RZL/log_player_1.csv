"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a fair share considering the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to reverse the offer from Round 1!

I'll have to consider the new values due to inflation. My gain is now worth 90% of $400,000, which is $360,000. Bob's gain is worth 80% of $600,000, which is $480,000.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to aim for a higher share considering the reduced values.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob. My previous gain of $360,000 is now worth 90% of that, which is $324,000. I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You can't beat this deal, Bob!""
}
```"
