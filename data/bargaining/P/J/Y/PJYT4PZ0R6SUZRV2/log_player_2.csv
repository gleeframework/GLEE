Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer was more than fair considering the inflation.  Let's settle this now and split it 55/45 in my favor.  It's the same split you wanted last round, but now it benefits me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
