I'm going to offer a pretty generous split, hoping to end the game quickly.  I'll take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking a lower share in the next round."
