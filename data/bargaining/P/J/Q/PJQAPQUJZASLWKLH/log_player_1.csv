"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is better. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to take the higher amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
