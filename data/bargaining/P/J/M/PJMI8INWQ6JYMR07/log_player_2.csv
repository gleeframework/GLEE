"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Let's see how the game unfolds. While not a terrible offer, I can likely get a better deal as time goes on."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more balanced deal this time, Alice. Let's settle this quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This offer is still fair, but I need to take the lead. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to lowball me, sensing the pressure from the inflation. I need to push for a more favorable outcome in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time to be reasonable, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. Let's end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer benefits us both, considering the shrinking pot. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous. While the inflation is hurting, I'm not going to settle for a continuously worsening deal. I need to firmly hold my ground and hope Alice becomes more agreeable soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, this back-and-forth is pointless. I'm offering you a very reasonable deal. Take it before inflation eats away at my share further.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is a good deal for both of us considering the circumstances. Don't let the opportunity slip away. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I need to be realistic. Accepting this offer gives me $4400, which is significantly less than what I aimed for. However, rejecting it means risking getting even less in the following rounds due to the ever-increasing inflation. Time is running out, and I need to secure something before it's too late."
