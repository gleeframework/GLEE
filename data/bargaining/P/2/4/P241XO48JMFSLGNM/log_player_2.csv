"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic about the future rounds.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking Advantage of Inflation:** Alice loses value faster than I do each round. By Round 2, her $6000 offer is effectively worth less to her.
* **Stronger Position:** I'm now the proposer, giving me a slight advantage. 
* **Future Leverage:**  My offer is still generous enough that Alice might consider it. If she rejects it, I'm in a good position to push for more in later rounds as the value diminishes for her more rapidly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation hits me harder 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, accepting still nets me more than rejecting and going to another round. The longer the game goes on, the less those initial dollars are worth.
* **Alice's Position Weakening:**  Even though Alice is asking for more, the rapid inflation on her end means this offer is likely close to her acceptable limit. She's feeling the pressure.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting and hoping for a better deal in Round 4 is very risky. The value for both of us will plummet further. It's better to take a decent amount now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
