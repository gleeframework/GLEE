"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know I'm losing money each round, but we can both leave with something good! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get the best deal possible.  While Alice's proposal is tempting, I'm going to see if I can do better in the next round.  I'll be making the offer, and I know Alice is losing money faster than me.  Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm happy to split it evenly, Alice.  Since I'm losing less money each round, I think this is a fair offer that allows us both to come out ahead. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want to split evenly, Bob, but time is running out for me. This offer still gives you a good amount! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting, I still think I can get a better deal. Alice is losing money faster than me, and I think she might be more willing to compromise in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to 55 for myself, but I'm running out of time too. We need to find a solution quickly, or we'll both lose out. What do you think?""}
