"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $100, leaving Bob with 20%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it down the line. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: 50 (which is 50% of the new total, taking into account the inflation)
* Bob gain: 50

Considering the inflation, my gain of 50 is actually 40% of the original $100, which is a reasonable offer. I'll accept Bob's proposal to split it down the middle.
