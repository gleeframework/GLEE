"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, my effective gain in this round is 80% of 80% of $100, which is $64. 

I accept Bob's offer.
