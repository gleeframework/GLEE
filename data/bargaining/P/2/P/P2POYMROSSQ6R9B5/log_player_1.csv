"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount for your first proposal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more fair. 5500 for me, 4500 for you. This ensures we both get a good share and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the offer from Bob is equivalent to:

* Bob's gain: 5500 * 0.9 = 4950
* Alice's gain: 4500 * 0.9 = 4050

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
