"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get a good share, and we don't risk losing everything with further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to split it evenly, but I'm not sure I want to give up 500,000$.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new one."
