"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's worth taking a few rounds to see if Alice's sense of ""fairness"" changes as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Let's try a different approach. I'm willing to give you a good deal to avoid risking the whole pot later.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time to get serious, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the pot evenly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 50/50 split is fair, the inflation is working in my favor. I'm still holding out for a better deal, especially since I know Alice's gains are shrinking due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 80,
""alice_gain"": 20,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but I still need to ensure a good return for myself. Let's avoid further risk and settle this quickly.""
}
```"
