"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different approach. I'm willing to give you a good deal to avoid risking the whole pot later. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth even less, so I need to be careful. Bob's offer is actually a bit more generous than mine was in the first round, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll, and my potential gain is now worth even less. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Time to get serious, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the pot evenly.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but I still need to ensure a good return for myself. Let's avoid further risk and settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting now! My potential gain is worth significantly less than it was just a few rounds ago. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'm starting to get desperate.

I'll accept this offer to avoid losing even more value due to inflation.
