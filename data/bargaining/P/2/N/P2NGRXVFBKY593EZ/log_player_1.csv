"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars, which is a generous 30% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the rest 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a very generous offer from Bob!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty lopsided deal, Bob. I'm not interested in taking 20% of the remaining amount.""

```

I'll wait for his next offer, hoping he'll be more willing to compromise."
