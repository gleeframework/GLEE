"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this round, but I'll try to get a better deal in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain has decreased by 5% due to inflation.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, as he's taking a larger share this round. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```

Round 3
