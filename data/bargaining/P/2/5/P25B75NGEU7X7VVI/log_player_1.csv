"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 600k for me is fair, given the inflation rates. Your turn. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a larger share than I initially offered him. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. 550k for me, 450k for you. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still keeping a larger share for myself."
