"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal of 60$ for me and 40$ for Bob. Here's the offer in JSON format:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 20% less for Bob, I'll have to make a more favorable offer for Bob to accept. However, Bob's offer is already more generous than my previous offer, and it's a good opportunity to accept.
