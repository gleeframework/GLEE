"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you get $4,000. What do you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate.  Let's finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting the values, I'll need to adjust my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I think I can do better than a 45/55 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rate is still in effect, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. What do you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
