"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing with each round!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal in future rounds. However, Bob's proposal is a fair one, and it's a good opportunity to get a decent share.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing by 20% again!

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit desperate, Bob. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but still keeping a significant share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than that.  Let's get closer to a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly!

I'll have to be careful with this offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm not as eager to accept a deal that's still relatively close to my previous offers. However, Bob is trying to compromise, and I don't want to risk losing out on a decent share.

I'll accept this offer.
