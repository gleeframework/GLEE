"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the funds with a 7:3 ratio. This ensures a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split. While the money loses value each round, I believe this is a more equitable split.  Let's move forward and avoid further risk. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
