"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's better to end the game early to avoid inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since Bob is suggesting a 50/50 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risks and efforts.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I need a bigger share to make it worth my while 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the reduced value, I'll have to think carefully about Bob's offer. Since Bob is offering a larger share to himself, I'll have to decide whether it's worth accepting.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than a 40/60 split, especially considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I need to prioritize my own interests given the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal if I push my luck 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll have to think carefully about Bob's offer. With Bob offering a significant $8,000 and me getting only $2,000, I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and having even less value to negotiate with. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer, hoping that I'll at least get something out of this deal."
