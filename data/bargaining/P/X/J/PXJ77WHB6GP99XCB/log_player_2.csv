Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're playing a dangerous game.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving you a huge chunk of the money. Accept this offer, or we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to pressure me, but I'm not going to accept a terrible deal out of fear.  I need to show some flexibility, but this offer is still too low."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. The pressure is mounting, and I'm not willing to give you any more. Take it, or we'll both walk away empty-handed. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is playing hardball, and this is the best I'm likely to get. Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller potential gain for me due to inflation."
