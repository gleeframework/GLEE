Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a good deal 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the offer is worse than before in terms of my actual gain, the inflation is becoming too significant.  Accepting this offer is the best way to salvage any money at all."
