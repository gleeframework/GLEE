I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. While I'd prefer to have more, I'm concerned about the inflation. My share is already worth less due to the 5% loss.  It's likely the situation will only worsen if we keep playing.  It's better to take the 50/50 split and be done with it."
