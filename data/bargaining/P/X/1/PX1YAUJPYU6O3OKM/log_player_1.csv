"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. An even split is the best way to avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that an even split is the best way to avoid the risk of inflation. I think I can do better than that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking out for myself. You can't blame me for trying!""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I think this is a slightly more favorable split for me, but I'm still willing to compromise."
