"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's good to start negotiating, but I want to see what Alice is willing to do to get a deal done. I'll reject this offer and see if she's willing to budge."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. An even split is the best way to avoid the risk of inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking out for myself. You can't blame me for trying! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. While I'd still prefer an even split, Alice's offer is slightly better than the initial one, and I'm not sure how much more I can gain in the following rounds. I'll accept and secure some money before the value drops further."
