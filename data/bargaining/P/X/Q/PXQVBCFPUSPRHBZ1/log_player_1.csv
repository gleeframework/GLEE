"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to establish a good starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. You're getting a bit too generous. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my calculations.

Since the total amount is now 800,000 (1,000,000 * 0.8), I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'm not ready to accept yet.""
}
```

I'll think of a new proposal to counter his offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 80% of its original value, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself to account for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more reasonable given the reduced value of the money.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure you're being generous enough. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a better offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the total amount is now 512,000 (1,000,000 * 0.512), I'll evaluate Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too lopsided, Bob. I'm not willing to accept such a small share.""
}
```

I'll think of a new proposal to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 51.2% of its original value now. Considering the previous offers and the reduced value of the money, I'll aim for a more balanced split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 425000,
  ""bob_gain"": 575000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.""
}
