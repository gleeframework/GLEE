"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving you such a large share, especially considering the reduced value of the money.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 40:60 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for his next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, and considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48:52 split, which is a bit closer to a 50:50 split, but still in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to get a better deal. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with giving you such a large share, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I think I can do better than this.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal than a 30:70 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for his next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much more. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42:58 split, which is a bit closer to a 50:50 split, but still in my favor. I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, so let's see if Bob will accept it!"
