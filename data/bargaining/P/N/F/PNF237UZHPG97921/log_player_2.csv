"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small share, but I think we can do better in future rounds! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's far too low to accept in the first round. We have 12 rounds, and the money will be worth less with each passing round.  It's better to hold out for a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair.  I propose we split the money evenly.  We can figure out how to split the rest later.""}
