Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, it's crucial we settle this now. A fair deal ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
