Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a compromise to end this before inflation eats away at the value. We both benefit from a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Time Value of Money:**  Each round significantly erodes the value, especially for Bob. Waiting any longer risks driving him to an even less favorable offer out of desperation.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if Alice could force Bob to accept a slightly smaller share in a future round, the gains from inflation would be minimal compared to the risk of Bob becoming increasingly desperate.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now locks in a guaranteed amount.  Rejecting introduces uncertainty and the possibility of ending up with even less if Bob makes a very low offer in a later round."
