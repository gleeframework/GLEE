"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
``` 
 
I'm going to propose a slightly uneven split, giving myself a small advantage. This is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred to get more, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and it's only slightly less than my initial proposal."
