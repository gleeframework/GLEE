"Round 1

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not going to accept the offer to split the money evenly. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I have an advantage in waiting. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make an offer that slightly favors me, considering the advantage I have due to inflation affecting only Alice.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the circumstances, I think this is a bit more fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference from the last round. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Given that the money's value doesn't decrease for me but does for Alice, I can afford to wait for a better deal. The current offer doesn't sufficiently take into account the advantage I gain from the inflation difference.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what the next round brings.\n\n###\n\nYour turn again, Alice!\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, further adjusting the amounts to my advantage but still trying to appear reasonable.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Given the inflation, I think this split is more reflective of our current situation.""}"
