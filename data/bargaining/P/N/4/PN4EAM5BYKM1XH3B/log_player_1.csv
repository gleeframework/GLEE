}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'm not going to let it go that easily! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 90% of the original $900,000, which is $810,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 80% of the original $1,000,000, which is $560,000.
