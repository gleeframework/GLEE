"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but still feels fair. It also allows me to observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy for the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more than 50%, the inflation will significantly hurt me if I reject this offer. Accepting ensures I get at least some of the money, and there is no guarantee I will get a better deal in the next round."
