I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for the majority of the money. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more,  the inflation is starting to take a bite out of the potential gains.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the safest option to ensure I get something."
