Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself.  I figure Bob might accept even a tiny amount since it's better than nothing, and we can get this done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing by continuing to play."
