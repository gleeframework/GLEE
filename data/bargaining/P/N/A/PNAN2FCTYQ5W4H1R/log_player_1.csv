"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share to keep you interested.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair split, let's start with a clean slate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a clean slate, huh? I'm not sure if I'm ready to give him that just yet.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the majority. You can have a smaller share, but don't expect me to give you more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more aggressive! I'm not sure I like the direction this is heading.

However, I think I can do better than $4,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 19.11% less than in the first round, I'll have to get creative. Here's my next proposal:

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think I deserve a slight edge. You can have a larger share, but don't expect me to give up too much.""
