Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to try and get a better deal!  There's no reason to accept a 60-40 split right away, especially since the money will be worth less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  The inflation is hitting us both, but Alice's offer isn't taking that into account enough for me.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 55-45.  This is a fair compromise considering inflation and the fact that we both need to agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still think I can get a bit more. Inflation is hurting me too. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with this split.  While inflation is hitting us both, I think I can still get a better deal if I keep pushing.  I'll make another offer in the next round."
