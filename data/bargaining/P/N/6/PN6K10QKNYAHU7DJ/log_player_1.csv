"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a straightforward one - if Bob accepts, we can wrap up the game right away!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more for me, but still a decent split! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up $700,000, especially since the money is worth 20% less for Bob. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to try to find a compromise. I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will consider this a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, this offer is identical to the one I made in Round 3, and I already rejected it. I'm not willing to accept an offer that I've already rejected before.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, hoping to find a fair and equal solution. The message is straightforward and friendly, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
