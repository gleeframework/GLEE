Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 7500 for her, I'll offer her a smaller amount, but still a significant one, to make it more attractive for her to accept.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer is similar to my previous offer, but with a slight adjustment, I'll accept it this time.
