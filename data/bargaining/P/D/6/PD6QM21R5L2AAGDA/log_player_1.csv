Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 30:70 is a more reasonable starting point, considering the inflation rate. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
