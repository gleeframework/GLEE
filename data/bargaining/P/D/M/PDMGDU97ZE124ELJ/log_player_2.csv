"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.  Consider that the value of the money decreases for me each round, so a fair agreement now is better than a potentially better offer later. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250

# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly.  The longer we wait, the less valuable the money becomes for me.  
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
