"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to offer a 55/45 split in my favor.  While the money is losing value for both of us, I'm taking the risk that you might prefer to play another round and end up with less. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
