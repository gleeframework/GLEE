"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, we can negotiate later if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, but I'm leaving the door open for negotiations if Bob wants to make a counteroffer."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm taking the risk of inflation 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more because of inflation risk, but I'm not convinced. I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a big enough improvement, I'm willing to wait for a better offer.""
}
```"

Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""A bit more generous than last time, see if you like it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not convinced this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to bite! Bob's offer is a bit more generous, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. I'll offer a smaller share to Bob, hoping he'll accept.

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting less, but it's still a fair deal.""
}

# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm still not happy about the inflation 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll! Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, but considering the current value of the money, it's actually a pretty good deal for me. I'll accept his offer.
