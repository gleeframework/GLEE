"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is less than half of the total amount, but still a significant sum. Since there's inflation involved, I want to make sure I get a good deal before the money loses value. The message ""Let's split fairly!"" is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable offer, even though it's slightly biased in my favor.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide? Will he accept or make a counteroffer?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI don't want to accept this offer because Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation situation. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, a 60/40 split would actually be even more unequal than it appears. I want to try to get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI've already sent my new offer at the end of the previous response. Here it is again:\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm trying to be more reasonable and take into account the effects of inflation. Let's see what he decides!"
