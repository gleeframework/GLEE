  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the reason in my proposal and accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can get a better deal, considering the fact that the money is worth less to me with each passing round. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
