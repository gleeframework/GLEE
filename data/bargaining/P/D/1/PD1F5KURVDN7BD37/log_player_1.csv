"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice:\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering a division where I take $60 and Bob takes $40. Given the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases with each round, I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, considering he loses more value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice.  How about a slight adjustment for a more even split this time? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\nI'm not accepting this offer because, even though the money's value decreases with each round, Bob's proposed split doesn't compensate for the fact that the money is worth significantly less to him than to me in this round. Given the inflation rates, I believe I can propose a better split in the next round that benefits me more, considering Bob loses more value with each rejection."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice:\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, particularly on Bob's share, I'm adjusting my initial offer slightly to give myself a bit more. The rationale is that with each passing round, the money is worth less to both of us, but significantly less to Bob. This offer still gives Bob a substantial amount but acknowledges the decreasing value of the money, aiming to find a balance that Bob might accept to avoid further devaluation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time with inflation eating away at our potential gains. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. Do we agree? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains, especially on Bob's, a 50/50 split at this point is indeed the fairest and most logical outcome. Continuing to reject offers would only lead to both of us losing more value. Accepting this offer ensures we both get a reasonable share, considering the devaluation of the money over the rounds."
