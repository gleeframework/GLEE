Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. Time is running out and the value is decreasing. This offer is slightly better for me than the last one.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this over with. This offer gives you something and prevents us from losing everything to inflation. It's time to be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While the offer is slightly better than round 3, accepting now sets a bad precedent. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to risk it all going to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a slight edge to you, but it ends this now. Otherwise, we both risk getting nothing.""} 

**Reasoning:**

We're at a critical point.  I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal, but I also need to acknowledge the time pressure. This offer is a compromise: slightly favors her, but guarantees me something before inflation eats away too much.  The ""final offer"" statement adds weight and forces her to make a decision."
