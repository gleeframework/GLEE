"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'm willing to take a risk to potentially get more than half. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I want to try to get a bit more than half to compensate for the loss. I'm offering Alice 45$, which is still a relatively fair offer, but slightly in my favor. Let's see how she reacts!"
