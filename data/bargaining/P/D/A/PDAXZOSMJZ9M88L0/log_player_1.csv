Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split the money 55/45 in my favor. This reflects the fact that you're getting a larger discount on the money. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
