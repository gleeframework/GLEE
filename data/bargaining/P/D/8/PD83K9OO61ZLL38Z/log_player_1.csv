Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 70:30 ratio, with me receiving 700,000$ and you receiving 300,000$. This proposal aims for a fair split considering the initial value of the money.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 55:45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we need to account for. Let's end this now and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
