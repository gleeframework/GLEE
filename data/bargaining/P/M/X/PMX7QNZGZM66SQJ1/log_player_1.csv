"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to keep almost all the money for myself, leaving Bob with a single dollar. I know it's a bold move, but I want to see if he's willing to risk playing another round and facing the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's not ideal to accept a 50/50 split, given the inflation, the value of my potential gains in the next round would be significantly lower. It's better to take what I can get now."
