Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a fair share, but time is working against us both.  My offer is still generous considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
