"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 is worth 5% less than the 50 I would have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to 47.5. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of 60 is worth 20% less than the 50 he would have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to 40.

So, in terms of real value, I'd be getting 47.5 and Bob would be getting 40. This is a tough call, but I think I'll have to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round, and 5% less than the first round), I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a risk and give you a smaller share, but I think it's worth it 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Let's calculate the real value of the gains:

My gain of 30 is worth 14.26% less than the 50 I would have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to 43.09. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of 70 is worth 48.8% less than the 50 he would have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to 26.00.

So, in terms of real value, I'd be getting 43.09 and Bob would be getting 26.00. This is a tough decision, but I think I'll have to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

Since the money is worth even less now, I'll have to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting taken advantage of, so I'll take a larger share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more skewed in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer before the money becomes even more worthless!"
