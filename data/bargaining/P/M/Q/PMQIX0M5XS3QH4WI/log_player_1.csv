"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $600,000, which is 60%. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the inflation rate will affect Bob more significantly as the rounds progress. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid losing more value in subsequent rounds. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the value of the money decreases each round for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I had initially offered Bob a 40% share, and now Bob is offering me a 45% share while taking 55% for themselves. Although the inflation affects Bob more, this offer doesn't seem balanced considering the initial proposal and the fact that the money's value for me remains unchanged. I'll proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\nGiven that the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob each round, and we're now in the third round, I've adjusted my offer slightly from the initial one. Bob's portion is still significant but reflects the decreasing value they perceive with each passing round. This offer aims to find a middle ground, acknowledging the impact of inflation on Bob's perception of the money's value while still being favorable to me, as the value remains constant from my perspective. Let's see if Bob finds this proposal acceptable."
