"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm going to start by taking the majority of the money, but leaving Bob with a small amount. This is a risky strategy, but it's the best way to secure a large share of the money before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation.  While I'm losing 5% of my potential gains, he's losing 10%.  This means he's more likely to be willing to compromise in future rounds. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but still keeping a larger share. He's shown a willingness to take more, but I'm hoping that the pressure of inflation will push him towards a compromise."
