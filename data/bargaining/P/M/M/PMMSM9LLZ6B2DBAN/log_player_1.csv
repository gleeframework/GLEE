"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 3200 in the previous round's value.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal, considering the inflation. I'd rather negotiate further. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share this time. You can have 40%. It's a fair deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent deal. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in the first round, considering the cumulative inflation:

Initial value: $8000
Inflation (round 1): 20% decrease = $6400
Inflation (round 2): 20% decrease = $5120
Inflation (round 3): 20% decrease = $4096
Inflation (round 4): 20% decrease = $3275.2

Now, considering my gain of 4500 in round 4, its actual value is:

$4500 / 0.512 (1 - 0.488) = $8787.5

This is a significant increase from my previous gain, and I'm willing to accept it.
