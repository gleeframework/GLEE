Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but this back and forth is pointless.  This offer is a good deal for both of us - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, accepting now would mean accepting significantly less than half the pot. There's still a chance to negotiate a better outcome, even with the impact of inflation. Alice's increasingly frustrated tone suggests she wants a deal and may be willing to concede more in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the stakes are getting higher due to inflation.  A 50/50 split now guarantees a reasonable amount, even with the impact of inflation already factored in.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** Proposing an even split highlights fairness and might make Alice more receptive, especially as her previous offers have been heavily skewed in her favor. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message aims to create a sense of urgency, pushing Alice towards accepting a deal rather than risking continued losses from inflation."
