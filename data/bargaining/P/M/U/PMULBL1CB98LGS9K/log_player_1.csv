"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, and we can adjust in future rounds""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80 dollars and leave 20 dollars for Bob. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting that we start with a fair split and can adjust in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take the majority this time 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the new offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, the 80 dollars I could have gotten in the first round is now worth 72 dollars in this round (80 * 0.9). The offer on the table is 10 dollars, which is 13.89% of the original 72 dollars I could have gotten (10 / 72). This is a relatively small share.

On the other hand, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, but he's still getting 90 dollars, which is a significant amount.

Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I think I should be cautious and try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the rejection of my previous offer and the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the changing circumstances.

In this round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreased value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to adjust for inflation, let's meet in the middle this time""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you're getting less and less 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! In this round, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the 80 dollars I could have gotten in the first round is now worth around 58.48 dollars (80 * 0.731). The offer on the table is 5 dollars, which is 8.57% of the original 58.48 dollars I could have gotten. This is a very small share.

Considering the significant decrease in the value of money and the fact that Bob is not budging, I think I should be cautious and try to get a better deal. However, I also don't want to give up completely, so I'll think about what's the minimum I can accept.

Given the extreme imbalance in the offer, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreased value. However, I also don't want to give up too much, considering the previous offers and Bob's message. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, let's compromise on this""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking control, you're getting very little 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of money! In this round, the money I gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, so the 80 dollars I could have gotten in the first round is now worth around 47.56 dollars (80 * 0.596). The offer on the table is 1 dollar, which is 2.11% of the original 47.56 dollars I could have gotten. This is an extremely small share.

Considering the extremely low value of the money I would get and the fact that Bob is trying to take control, I think it's time to accept this offer. It's not a great deal, but it's better than giving up completely.
