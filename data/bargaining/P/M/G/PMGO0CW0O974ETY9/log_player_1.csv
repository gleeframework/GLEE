"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, but I'll give you a chance to do better!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm leaving room for him to negotiate and potentially do better in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 80% of its original value, so I'd get 80% of $500,000, which is $400,000.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but it's a relatively fair split. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
