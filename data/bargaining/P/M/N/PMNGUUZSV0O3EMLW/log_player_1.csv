I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm taking the lion's share, but giving Bob something to at least consider accepting in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob's proposal offers a significant amount of money, it's still not a good deal for me.  He's taking a much larger share, and the inflation is hitting my potential gains harder than his. I'm willing to wait for another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor this time.  Bob's offer in the last round was a bit too much for me, but I'm trying to be reasonable here. We're both taking a hit from inflation, so I think this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While the inflation is hitting both of us hard, I still believe I can get a better deal.  Bob's offer is starting to become more reasonable, but I'm not desperate enough to accept it just yet. I'm going to see if I can improve my position in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. The inflation has taken a big bite out of our potential gains, and it's clear that we need to compromise to get anything at all.  I believe a fair and equal split is the best way forward at this point."
