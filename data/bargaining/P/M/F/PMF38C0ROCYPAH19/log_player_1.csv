Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. I want to be as fair as possible while still securing a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. Even though I'm getting less, the inflation would reduce my share of the money further if I reject. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing later."
