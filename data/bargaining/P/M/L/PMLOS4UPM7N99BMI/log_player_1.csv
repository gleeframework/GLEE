"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this over with. Accept and we can both go home with a small fortune.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a paltry $1, but I'll get the bulk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This is a reasonable offer, and we can both get a good chunk of the money. It's much better than getting nothing! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a ""reasonable"" offer, especially considering the inflation effect. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. It's only fair, considering we're both in this together.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more conciliatory this time, and propose a 50-50 split."
