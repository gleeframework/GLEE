"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this over with. Accept and we can both go home with a small fortune. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very unfair offer, and there are many more rounds to play.  I'll see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. This is a reasonable offer, and we can both get a good chunk of the money. It's much better than getting nothing!""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's only fair, considering we're both in this together. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is much fairer than the previous offers. It's a good split and better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
