Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:** Even though my offer was rejected in round 2, inflation is working against me. The money I gain is now worth less, while Alice's offer is still relatively favorable.
* **Potential Outcome:** If I reject, Alice gets to make the next offer. It's likely she'll keep the majority, and the inflation will make the money I receive even less valuable in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting the offer secures a decent amount of money, even with the inflation factor. Rejecting it carries the risk of getting a worse deal later."
