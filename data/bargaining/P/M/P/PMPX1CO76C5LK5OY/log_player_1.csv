"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like a bit more since we're both taking risks now. Let's see how this goes. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain remaining the same value as in the first round, but Bob's gain being worth 10% less, I'm not too thrilled about the offer. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round either. I'll accept the offer.
