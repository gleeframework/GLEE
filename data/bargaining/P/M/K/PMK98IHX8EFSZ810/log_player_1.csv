"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a somewhat aggressive offer, hoping to secure a good portion of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair. Even with the inflation, 10 dollars is a terrible deal. I'll reject this and try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer a bit to 80/20, but still try to secure a good portion of the money.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a much fairer deal than his last offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfair, even though it seems like he's giving more.  It's not worth it for me to accept such a small portion of the money, even with the inflation. I'll keep fighting for a fairer deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. Bob seems to be very stubborn, but I'm hoping he'll see the sense in a more balanced deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough.  While I'm losing a lot due to inflation, I'm still determined to get a fairer share.  I'll keep fighting for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm still hoping to secure a good portion of the money.  Time is running out, and I need to make sure we get something before inflation completely eats away at the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is a lot better than the previous ones, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation.  I'll keep fighting for a fairer deal, even though time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, I need to be more realistic.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will finally see the need for a compromise. We are both losing a lot of money due to inflation, and it's better to get something than nothing at this point."
