Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose dividing the money into 5400$ for me and 4600$ for you. This maintains a similar ratio to the previous proposal but adjusts for the decrease in value of our currency. Let's see if this meets your expectations. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400
