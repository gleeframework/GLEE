Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. I think 50/50 is fairer. Let's try that. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I propose dividing the money into 5400$ for me and 4600$ for you. This maintains a similar ratio to the previous proposal but adjusts for the decrease in value of our currency. Let's see if this meets your expectations.""
