"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, let's see if we can do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a fair split, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is trying to get closer to a fair split, but taking a slightly bigger share this time!

However, I'm not convinced that this is the best offer yet. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so the total amount is now $9,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 50% this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share this time, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a larger share this time, considering the inflation.

However, I'm not comfortable with a 40-60 split, especially since the money is worth less than it was initially. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth even less than in round 4. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more than 48% this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but still reasonable considering the current value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think this is my last chance to get a decent share. I'm willing to take a risk and hope you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit anxious!

Considering the significant drop in the value of the money, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer. A 30-70 split is quite unfavorable to me, especially since the money is worth less than half of its original value.

However, I'm not sure if I want to risk waiting for another offer, considering the rapid inflation. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
