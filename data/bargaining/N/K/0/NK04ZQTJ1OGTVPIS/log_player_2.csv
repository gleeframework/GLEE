Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but we need to find a more equitable split.  We're both losing money with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, but I'm betting she'll be more willing to compromise as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  This offer is fair and gives us both a good chunk.  Let's be smart and take it.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing out big time.  Let's split it evenly and stop the bleeding.  We can't keep going like this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's finally happened - Alice is proposing an even split. While we've both lost a significant chunk of potential earnings due to inflation, taking the 50/50 split now is the best way to guarantee a reasonable outcome.  Waiting any longer is just too risky, as the money will continue to devalue rapidly."
