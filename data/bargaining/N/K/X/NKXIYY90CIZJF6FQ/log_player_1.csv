"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see if we can improve it.""
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I can do better, huh? Well, I'm not going to give him the upper hand that easily. I'll reject his offer and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted me to do better, so I'm offering you a slightly smaller share.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant one. Let's see if he'll accept this offer or try to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced you're being generous enough! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob still thinks I'm not being generous enough? Okay, I'll try to meet him in the middle. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a fair compromise, and it's better than my previous offer. Let's see if Bob is happy with this outcome!"
