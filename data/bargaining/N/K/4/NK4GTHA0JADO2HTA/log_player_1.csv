"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more fair split. We both take a risk with inflation, but this gives us both a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
