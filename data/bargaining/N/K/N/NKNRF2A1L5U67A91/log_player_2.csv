"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, but it heavily favors her in the long run.  I need to push for a larger share in the early rounds to make up for the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""The inflation puts me at a disadvantage. I need a larger share upfront to make it fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll meet you halfway from my initial offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but this offer is still unacceptable. I need to hold firm and make it clear that a significant portion of the money needs to be mine in the early stages for this to be remotely fair.  The inflation is eating away at my potential gains with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""This offer accounts for the inflation's impact on my share.  We need to reach a deal soon!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below 525k. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting dangerously close to the wire! While Alice's offer is getting more tempting, accepting now would still leave me with significantly less value due to the inflation. I need to gamble one more time that she's willing to negotiate further rather than risk it all on a terrible deal in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""}
```"
