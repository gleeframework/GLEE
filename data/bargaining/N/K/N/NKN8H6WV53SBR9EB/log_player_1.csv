"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll take it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
