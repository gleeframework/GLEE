"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, which means he's trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives him a 2:1 advantage. I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 2:1 in his favor, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, giving me a 55% share and Bob a 45% share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze Bob's offer. Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means he's still trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'm not thrilled about the 51.2% to 48.8% split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a slightly more balanced offer than before. I'll take the deal.
