"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, but I'm sure Bob might try to negotiate for more!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer, I'll think for a moment...

Since the money is worth 20% less now, the effective values are:

Alice gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200
Bob gain: 6000 * 0.8 = 4800

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a larger share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
