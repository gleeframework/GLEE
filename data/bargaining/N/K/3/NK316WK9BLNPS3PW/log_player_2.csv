Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, Bob, but let's be realistic. This is a better offer than the last one, and time is money! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement, but we need to find a middle ground. This split feels more equitable given the time pressure.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm coming down slightly again, but this is my final offer.  Let's close this deal and both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean Bob loses significantly due to inflation.  There's still a chance to negotiate a better deal, and even if the next offer is slightly worse, it's better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing due to the time pressure.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, listen. I understand the time pressure, but 50/50 is simply not acceptable given the starting point. This is my absolute final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The clock is really ticking now.  While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees Bob gets something, and it's better than Alice's previous offer considering the inflation.  Rejecting carries a huge risk of getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
