"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount.""
}
``` 

This is a starting offer in the Ultimatum Game with a time constraint and inflation. Here's the reasoning:

* **Strategic Advantage:** Alice starts with a slight advantage as the value of the money depreciates faster for her (10% vs. 5%). This means she needs to secure a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Fairness and Incentive:** While a 60/40 split favors Alice, it's not drastically unfair to Bob. It gives Bob a decent incentive to accept rather than risking getting a smaller share in later rounds due to inflation. 
* **Message Tone:** The message aims to appear reasonable and cooperative, encouraging Bob to accept the offer. 
 
Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting to be fair Alice, but due to inflation, this split makes more sense long term.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! While his message sounds reasonable, his offer is shifting heavily in his favor. It's too early to accept a deal where I get significantly less, especially since the inflation hurts me more than him. I need to counter with an offer that balances fairness with the time pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, we both lose with drawn-out negotiations. This offer is fair and avoids us getting pennies on the dollar later.""
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense now:

* **Turning the Tables:** This offer mirrors Bob's proposal but with the amounts flipped in Alice's favor. This demonstrates that she understands the impact of inflation and is willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significantly smaller share.
* **Time Pressure:** By round 3, the inflation is becoming a factor for both players. Alice's message emphasizes the urgency of reaching a deal before the money loses too much value. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Even though this offer favors Alice, it's still within the realm of a potentially acceptable deal for Bob, especially considering the time pressure. The message aims to portray Alice as fair and solution-oriented."
