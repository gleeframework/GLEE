"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take 55, you get 45.  We can get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's try 58 for me and 42 for you. It's only fair after your low offer!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. 50/50 is the fairest way to split it. We've both had our chances to be greedy, now let's just end this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the money is worth 36% less for me now, getting 50 is actually a better deal than getting 45 in the first round. I'll take it!"
