"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split is a fair and simple proposal, considering the diminishing value of money for you, but not for me. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
