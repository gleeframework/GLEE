"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to take $600,000 and give Bob $400,000. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept the offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this offer accounts for the time value of money. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. The difference in the effect of inflation on our gains (10% for me vs 5% for Bob) might give me some leverage to get a more favorable division. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm taking into account the effects of inflation on both our gains. Given that my gain is worth 10% less and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than the original amount, I've adjusted my proposal to find a middle ground. I'm now proposing to take $580,000 and give Bob $420,000, hoping that this compromise will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money, Alice. This is a fair offer given the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain, I believe there's still room for negotiation. The fact that Bob's gain is decreasing at a slower rate than mine might make him more willing to compromise in the next round. Additionally, I'm hoping that Bob will start to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of the money and be more open to finding a mutually acceptable division. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting me more; let's settle""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm acknowledging that the inflation is having a more significant impact on my potential gain than on Bob's. I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness by pointing out that I'm being more affected by the decreasing value of the money. By proposing a division of $560,000 for me and $440,000 for Bob, I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the compromise I'm making and be willing to accept this offer, bringing an end to the negotiations."
