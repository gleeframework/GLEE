"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more aggressive offer since I rejected Alice's first one.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of money, I think this offer is a good compromise. I'll accept it.
