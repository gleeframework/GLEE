Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the money is worth less for me each round. Let's compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing later."
