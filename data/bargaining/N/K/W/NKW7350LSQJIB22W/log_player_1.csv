"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a significant share of the money while still leaving Bob with something. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, avoiding the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though my share is significantly less than my initial offer, the 5% inflation makes this offer a much better deal than risking further rounds.  I don't know how much inflation Bob is experiencing, but even with a potential 20% reduction, a 50/50 split is still a reasonable outcome."
