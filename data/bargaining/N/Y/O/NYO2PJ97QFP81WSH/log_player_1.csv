"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a fair but ambitious offer. I want to secure a large portion of the money, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's role in the game. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, as the money will only decrease in value for me in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's a lot better than getting nothing, I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. The value of my money is decreasing, and I need to make sure I secure a larger portion.  I'll be the one making the offer in the next round, and I'll be aiming for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm proposing a 5500/4500 split. This is still a significant amount for me, considering the inflation, and it's a more equitable offer than Bob's previous one. I believe this is a good compromise that gives us both a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is starting to take a serious toll, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm happy to settle for it at this point."
