I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a good amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I understand the inflation is making my money worth less, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share. I'm hoping we can find a more balanced solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, recognizing the impact of inflation.  I'm hoping this is fair enough for Bob to accept."
