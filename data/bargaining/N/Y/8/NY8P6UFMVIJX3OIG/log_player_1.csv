"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, and I'll take $60. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer of $40 for me and $60 for him. Although his message suggests an even split, the actual offer is the opposite. I think I can negotiate for a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI've decided to make a more moderate offer this time, proposing that I take $55 and Bob takes $45. My message to Bob suggests meeting in the middle, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see how Bob responds!"
