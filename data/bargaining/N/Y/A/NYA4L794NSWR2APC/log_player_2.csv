"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I can potentially get a better deal if I wait. However, I'll make a slightly more favorable offer to myself this round.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is more fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation, Bob, but I'm still willing to split it a bit more evenly.  How about this? 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is still worth the same to me but continues to lose value for Alice, I'll reject this offer in hopes of getting an even better deal next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what Alice does next!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I can potentially get a better deal if I wait. However, I'll make a slightly more favorable offer to myself this round.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact on your end, I think this is more reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to be realistic about the inflation, Bob.  This is the best I can do right now. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is still worth the same to me but has lost significant value for Alice, and she's now offering a 60-40 split, which is closer to what I previously proposed, I'll accept this offer. It seems like further negotiation might not yield a significantly better deal for me, and there's a risk Alice could decide to offer less in the next round to try and cut her losses due to inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the deal!"
