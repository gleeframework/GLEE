I'll start with a pretty generous offer.  Let's see if Bob is feeling cooperative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is pretty unfair. I'll reject and see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll try a more balanced offer this time. Hopefully, Bob is starting to see that we need to find a middle ground."
