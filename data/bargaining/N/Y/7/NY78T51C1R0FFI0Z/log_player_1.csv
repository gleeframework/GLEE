"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, you can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 4:1 is too extreme! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing with each round!

I'll think about Bob's offer... Hmm, 3:1 is still a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
