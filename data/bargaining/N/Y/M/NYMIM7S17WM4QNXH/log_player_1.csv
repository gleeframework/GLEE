```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,

}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice! Let's make a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I'd like to aim for a higher share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 63,
  ""bob_gain"": 37,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $37 and keeping $63 for myself, hoping this will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, Alice. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the continuous decrease in value due to inflation, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as $60 is a decent share considering the decreasing value of the money."
