"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think meeting in the middle is a bad idea, but I'd like to try to get a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55/45?""}

I'm increasing my proposed share by 5 dollars, hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is still too much for me. How about 52.5/47.5? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. The 52.5/47.5 split is close enough to my original proposal, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money losing more value due to inflation."
