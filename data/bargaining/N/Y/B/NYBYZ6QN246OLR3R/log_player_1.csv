I'm going for a greedy strategy, aiming for a large share in the first round. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm not gaining much, I'm better off taking the $1000 now than risking losing even more with further rounds of inflation."
