"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 420,000, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
