"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This way, I secure a large portion of the money while leaving Bob with something. It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the inflation and Bob's rejection. I'm willing to reduce my share to 850,000, but I need to ensure I get a significant portion. This offer still leaves Bob with a considerable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair due to the inflation. I need to ensure I get a substantial share of the remaining money, as the value of the money decreases with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I still need to ensure I receive the majority. This offer acknowledges the inflation but also allows Bob to gain a substantial amount. If we keep rejecting each other, the value of the money will be negligible, and we will both lose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfair, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. It's important for me to secure a significant amount of the remaining money, considering the rapid devaluation. It's better to keep trying to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I still need to secure a majority. This offer considers the rapidly increasing inflation, but also allows Bob to gain a considerable amount. We need to come to an agreement before the money loses too much value."
