"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 in my favor is a fairer split, considering I'm the one taking the risk by rejecting your offer.  Let's get this done before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
