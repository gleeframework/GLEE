"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair starting point, Bob. Let's work together to find a solution we both like. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While it's a fair starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more balanced split, taking into account the potential for inflation. Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe a more even split is fairer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I still think I could get a better deal, the inflation is starting to hurt. This offer is a decent compromise, and I want to avoid further potential losses."
