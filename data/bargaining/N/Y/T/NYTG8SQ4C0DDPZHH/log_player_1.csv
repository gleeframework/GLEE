"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority but you'll get a decent share""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40% or $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 30% I'd get in Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split, no hard feelings""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
