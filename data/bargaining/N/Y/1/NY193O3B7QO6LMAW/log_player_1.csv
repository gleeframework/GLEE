  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate much""

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since my gain is worth 5% less, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than I would have gotten in the first round.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the decreasing value of my share. I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the erosion of value.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is catching up! Considering the significant decrease in the value of my share, I'll have to be more cautious. However, I don't want to give up too much either. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal to account for the significant decrease in value. I'll aim for a higher share to make up for it.
