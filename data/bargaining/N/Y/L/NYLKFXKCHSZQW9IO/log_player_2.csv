"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I need to see a greater compromise from you as well. This feels like a fairer split, what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of the faster rate of inflation on my end. While she's giving up some of her initial share, I'm losing money much quicker with each round. Holding out for a better offer is still the best strategy."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe this split is more equitable.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is really starting to hurt now, and Alice is unlikely to offer a better deal in later rounds.  While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable share before the money loses even more value.  It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting a much smaller amount (or nothing) later."
