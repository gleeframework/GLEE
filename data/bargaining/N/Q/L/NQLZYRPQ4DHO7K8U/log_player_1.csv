"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**My reasoning:** 

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share of the money. While I'm aware of the inflation, I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that gives him a relatively small amount. This will help me gauge his risk tolerance and whether he's more interested in getting some money now or waiting for a potentially better offer in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**My reasoning:**

While I'm aware of the inflation, I'm still not comfortable with this offer. Bob's offer is a significant decrease from my initial proposal, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to offer me a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

**My reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  Bob rejected my initial proposal, which was a significant split in my favor. This suggests he may be more risk-averse.  By increasing my offer slightly, I'm trying to show a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good share of the money. I'm also taking into account the inflation factor, which means I need to secure a larger portion to maintain the value of my earnings from the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**My reasoning:**

This offer, while not ideal, is getting closer to a point where I might be willing to settle. Considering the inflation, my gain is worth significantly less than the initial offer.  Bob's offer is fairly close to my previous offer, and it's possible that further rounds will lead to even lower gains for me due to the inflation effect. It's also possible that Bob will continue to offer increasingly higher proportions for himself, which could leave me with a much smaller share.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent amount, and the risk of waiting for a potentially better offer is too high given the inflation rate."
