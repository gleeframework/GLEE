Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my opening offer. I'm aiming for the majority of the money, but giving Bob a small amount to potentially incentivize acceptance in the first round.  Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd like to get more, it's likely that Bob will keep offering 50/50 splits in subsequent rounds. With inflation hitting him harder than me, I'm better off accepting this offer now."
