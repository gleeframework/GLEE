"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose taking 90 dollars and giving Bob 10 dollars. This is a fair starting point that hopefully incentivizes Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I propose taking 40 dollars and giving Bob 60 dollars.  Since the money I receive is worth less due to inflation, I need to take a bit more to compensate. However, I still want to be fair and offer Bob a significant share."
