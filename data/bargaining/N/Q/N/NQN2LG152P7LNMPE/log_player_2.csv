"Round 1
Alice's offer:

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's fair, I can potentially get a better deal for myself by playing the game a bit longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try a more even split.  I'm willing to give you a little less, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  Even though I'm getting slightly less than my previous offer, it's still a reasonable deal, and the risk of further inflation means I could end up with nothing."
