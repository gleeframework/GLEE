This is a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the value for Bob diminishes significantly with each round. 
* **Fair Offer:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair. Holding out for a slightly better deal might backfire if Bob gets increasingly desperate and offers even less favorable terms later. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a decent share.  Rejecting risks getting nothing if we fail to agree in the remaining rounds."
