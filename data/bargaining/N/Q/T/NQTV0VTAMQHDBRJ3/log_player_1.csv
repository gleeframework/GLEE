"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to take $550,000, which is slightly more than half of the total amount, and offering Bob $450,000. I've included a message suggesting that this division is fair, considering I'm taking on the risk of the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time. I'm willing to take a slightly larger share since I'm losing more value each round. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the effects of inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a larger share in the next round. Additionally, Bob's argument about taking a larger share due to losing more value each round doesn't convince me, as I'm still losing value, albeit at a slower rate. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance this time, consider the future rounds""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to take $580,000, increasing my share from the previous rounds, and offering Bob $420,000. My message to Bob emphasizes that I'm taking a firmer stance this time, implying that I'm willing to take a harder line in negotiations. I'm considering the decreasing value of money in future rounds and trying to maximize my gain. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
