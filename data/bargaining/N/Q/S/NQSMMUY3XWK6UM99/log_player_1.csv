"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. I'm aiming for a quick resolution, but also don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more favorable to him, and even though I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives him such a large advantage. I believe I can still get a better deal if I make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share slightly, but still offering Bob a fair amount. This offer is a compromise, aiming to reach a deal before inflation erodes the value of the money further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has hit me hard, Bob's offer is still better than what I would get if we continue and the value continues to decrease. I'll accept this offer."
