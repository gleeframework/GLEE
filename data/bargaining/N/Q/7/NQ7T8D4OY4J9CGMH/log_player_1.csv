"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial $10,000, and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly proposal to split the money in a 4:1 ratio, which I think is a fair starting point."
