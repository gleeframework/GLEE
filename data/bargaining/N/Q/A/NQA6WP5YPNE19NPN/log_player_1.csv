"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward proposal to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth 5% less, I can see that Bob's offer is a bit biased towards himself.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was biased towards himself, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. I'll give him a slightly larger share, but not as large as his previous offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This offer gives Bob a larger share, but still leaves me with a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take a toll on the money, and Bob's offer is getting more biased towards himself again.

Considering the reduced value of the money Bob gains, I'll think twice before rejecting this offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer carefully.

However, I still think I can do better. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money now, and Bob's offer is still biased towards himself. However, considering the reduced value of the money Bob gains, I think this offer might be the best I can get from him.

I'll accept the offer, as it's not too far off from the original 50-50 split, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with the money's value continuing to decrease.
