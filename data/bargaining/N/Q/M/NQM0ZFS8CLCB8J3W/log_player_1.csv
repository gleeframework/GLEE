"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer guarantees me a gain, albeit a smaller one than I initially hoped for. It's better to secure something now than risk losing more with further rounds and inflation."
