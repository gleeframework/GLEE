Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I want to secure as much as possible before it kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the 10% inflation, this offer is still better for me than the 900,000 I could get if I reject and try to make a counter offer.  I risk further inflation making my potential gain even lower, so accepting is the best choice."
