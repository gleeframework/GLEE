"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority but give you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1000, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll need to consider the inflation risk, but I'm willing to gamble for a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money fairly, but I'm also aware of the time constraint. Let's both get a good amount before the money depreciates too much."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer gives us both a larger share than the previous round, and ensures we both get a decent amount before the money continues to lose value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, this offer is a significant improvement over the previous round, especially considering the inflation. I'm accepting to ensure I get something before the money becomes worthless."
