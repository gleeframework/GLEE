"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose dividing the money into a 95:5 split. This offers a more balanced distribution while still providing a substantial amount for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a more fair compromise, considering the inflation has affected your earnings more than mine. Think about it, Bob. If we keep going, the money keeps losing value for you, but mine stays the same.  Let's reach an agreement before it's too late!""}
