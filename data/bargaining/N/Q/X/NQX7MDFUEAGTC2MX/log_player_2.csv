""message"": ""I propose dividing the money into a 95:5 split. This offers a more balanced distribution while still providing a substantial amount for both parties.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This time, I'm proposing a 90:10 split.  It's a more fair compromise, considering the inflation has affected your earnings more than mine. Think about it, Bob. If we keep going, the money keeps losing value for you, but mine stays the same.  Let's reach an agreement before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
