"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

In the first round, I would have gotten $80, but due to inflation, it's now worth 10% less, so I'd get $80 * 0.9 = $72.

In this round, Bob is offering me $50, which is worth 20% less than the $62.50 I would have gotten in the first round (20% of $62.50 is $12.50, so $62.50 - $12.50 = $50).

Considering this, I think I can do better than $50. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Taking into account the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer.

In the first round, I would have gotten $80, but due to inflation, it's now worth 10% less in each subsequent round. So, in this round, I'd get $80 * (0.9)^2 = $72 * 0.9 = $64.8.

In the second round, Bob offered me $50, which is 20% less than the $62.50 I would have gotten in the first round. I'll aim to get a bit more than that.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100, and Bob gets 45%."
