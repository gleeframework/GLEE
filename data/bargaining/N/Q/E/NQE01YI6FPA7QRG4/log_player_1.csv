"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $100 equally between us, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do slightly better, how about this?  I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm also sure I can get a better deal in the next round.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Bob's offer is still a bit too greedy, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can get a better deal. I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want to keep some for myself.""}

I'm trying to be more flexible and offer Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding onto a bigger chunk for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
