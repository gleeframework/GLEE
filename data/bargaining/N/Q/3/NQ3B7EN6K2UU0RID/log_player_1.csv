"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair deal, considering the money depreciates faster for you. Let's split it this way. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think I'm getting a significantly worse deal. The 40/60 split is not favorable to me, especially considering the money is depreciating faster for me. I'd like to make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation rates.""}

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a fair deal considering the inflation rates are higher for you. 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think I'm still getting a worse deal. The 38/62 split is not favorable to me, and I'm not convinced that the slight decrease in Bob's share is enough to make up for the difference. I'd like to make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is the maximum I can afford considering the inflation rates. Let's try to find a compromise.""}

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being willing to compromise. I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a fair deal."
