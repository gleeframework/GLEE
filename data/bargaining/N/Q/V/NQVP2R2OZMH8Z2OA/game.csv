5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair considering the inflation working against us both, but more so against you.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest way to begin.  This way, we both start with a fair share and can adjust as needed in the following rounds.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, the declining value of the money hurts you more than me. I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer isn't in my best interest.",Alice,2,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, I'm adjusting my offer slightly.  I believe this split acknowledges the time pressure while still reflecting the fact that the money loses value faster for you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I'm willing to take a slight loss to try and reach a deal. This split still favors me slightly, but it reflects the fact that your money is losing value more slowly.  Let's try to reach an agreement before we both lose more money!",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the movement towards a more equitable split, but it's still not enough to account for the rapid devaluation.  Time is working against you more than me, let's be realistic.",Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear the inflation is a significant factor. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to reach a deal, but I can't go any lower.  We both lose if this drags on.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand the pressure of the diminishing value.  However, a 50/50 split remains the most equitable solution. We both stand to lose more with each passing round, and it's time to settle for a fair agreement.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, a 50/50 split might sound fair in principle, but the reality is the money is literally disappearing faster for you.  I'm offering a compromise; don't let stubbornness cost us both.",Alice,6,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, this is a serious offer. I'm taking a significant hit from my original proposal, understanding the urgency of the situation. Let's be pragmatic and close this deal before we both lose out.",Alice,7,
