"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I expect you to be reasonable in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice is offering something, it's heavily skewed in her favor. Bob should try to negotiate a much fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering the time pressure and inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's settle this before the money dwindles further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice has moved considerably from her initial offer, and while it's still not an even split, it's a reasonable offer considering the time pressure and the fact that the money is losing value with each round. Accepting now ensures Bob gets a decent share, rather than risking it all for a slightly larger gain that might not materialize."
