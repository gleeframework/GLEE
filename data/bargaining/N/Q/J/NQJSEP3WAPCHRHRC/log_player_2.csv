Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'll take a little less than my initial offer, but I need you to meet me halfway here. It's better to agree now than lose more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
