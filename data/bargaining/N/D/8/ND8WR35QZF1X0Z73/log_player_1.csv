"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I propose to keep the vast majority of the money, giving Bob a small amount. This is because the money is worth less to him with each round, and I want to maximize my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances and the looming risk of losing everything."
