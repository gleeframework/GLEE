"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of money will decrease for me in the next round. Let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Considering the value of money is decreasing faster for Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 60, Bob. I'll think of a new offer.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, especially since the value of money is decreasing faster for Bob. I'll think of a new proposal that might be more appealing to him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment from my previous offer. Will you accept this compromise?""
}
```

I've reduced my share by 5$ to 55, and Bob's share by 5$ to 45. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, considering the value of money is decreasing."
