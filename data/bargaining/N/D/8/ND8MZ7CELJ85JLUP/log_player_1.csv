Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger risk due to inflation, so I need a better deal to compensate. This is my final offer before things get really bad for me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tricky situation, but accepting is the most logical choice now:

* **Time Pressure:**  The longer the game goes, the less Bob's share is worth to him due to inflation. However, this doesn't affect you directly.
* **Shrinking Options:** Bob explicitly stated this is his final offer before things ""get really bad"" for him. It's unlikely he'll offer more in subsequent rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting means gambling on getting a better deal in Round 5. However, there's no guarantee Bob will offer more, and you risk getting an even worse deal.

While $4,000 isn't ideal, it's better than risking a worse outcome by letting the game continue."
