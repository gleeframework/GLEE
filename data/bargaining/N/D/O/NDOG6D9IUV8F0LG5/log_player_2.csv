Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I need to get a better share than 40%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is willing to give up more, and I'm losing money faster than she is.  Let's take the deal before I lose even more!"
