  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can seal the deal.""
}
```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't do better than this, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than before, so I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more generous, but I'm not sure if I should take it. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
