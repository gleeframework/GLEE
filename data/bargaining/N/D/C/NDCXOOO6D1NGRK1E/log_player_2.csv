"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn to propose a fairer split. This is the best offer you'll get.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:**  Alice's offer significantly favored her. By rejecting, we signal we're not pushovers and are willing to play the game.  More importantly, the value of the money decreases faster for her with each round.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** Offering Alice $4500 is still more than the $4000 she initially wanted. It shows a willingness to compromise but also ensures a better outcome for us.
* **Direct Message:** The message aims to create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Alice to accept rather than risk getting a worse offer later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the last offer 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unfavorable:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, this offer still gives her a significant advantage. 
* **Time Pressure Increasing:** The inflation is working in our favor.  Alice is losing value faster than we are, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal in the next round. 
* **Aiming for at Least Even:** Our goal is to secure at least $5,000.  By continuing to reject these offers, we increase the chances of Alice panicking and offering a more acceptable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out!  Let's be fair and split this evenly before it's worth even less.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Even Split:** This offer is as fair as it gets. By proposing it, we appear reasonable and remove any justification for Alice to reject based on fairness.
* **Time Pressure Emphasis:** The message stresses the diminishing value of the money, aiming to push Alice towards a decision.
* **Final Offer Implication:** While not explicitly stated, the tone suggests this might be our final offer, encouraging Alice to accept before the deal potentially worsens for her."
