"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent share to get the ball rolling.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, I'll try to do better! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation.

I don't think Bob's offer is good enough, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject it and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous round's rejection, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy! I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm still the one calling the shots.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time to get serious, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the reduced value, Bob's offer seems like a decent compromise. Meeting in the middle is a reasonable approach, especially since I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't agree.
