Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal. How about we switch it up -  $55 for me and $45 for you?  The value decreases quickly, so it's best to settle sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
