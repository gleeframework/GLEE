"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a fair split is tempting, there's a lot of money at stake and the inflation will heavily impact Bob.  Rejecting allows Bob to propose a deal more favorable to him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, I'll take a bit more to compensate for the coming inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still quite favorable to her, and the inflation is starting to hurt.  Rejecting keeps the pressure on Alice to make a more equitable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and avoid further losses. A 50/50 split is fair given the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit, but I still think I deserve more. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the inflation is hitting hard, rejecting keeps the pressure on Alice. Bob can still afford to wait, and there's a chance she'll be forced to offer something more fair due to the dwindling time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  We're losing too much money with each passing round, and I need to be able to recoup some of my losses.""} 
```"
