"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to shift the odds a bit more in my favor. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This way, I'm getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."

# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll on Bob's offer! Since the money is worth less and less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that. However, 35/65 is still a relatively close split, and I'll try to get a bit more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 65/35, I'll try to push the odds even further in my favor. Here's my offer:

I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
