Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very uneven split.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount, or if he's going to play hardball.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Let's split the money evenly!"
