"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $50, but due to inflation, its value will be $45 (since 50 * 0.9 = 45).

I'll accept the offer.
