I'm still not happy with this offer.  Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, and I won't let her get away with it. I'm hoping for a more balanced split."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to pressure me with the threat of losing everything, but I won't cave in.  I've been consistent with my proposals, and I believe in the value of fairness.  I'm not going to accept an offer that heavily favors her, especially when we're both losing value with each passing round."

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to let Alice bully me into accepting a bad deal. It's true I'm losing money with each round, but I'm not going to be forced into accepting her offer just because she's trying to intimidate me. I'm going to stick to my principles and keep pushing for a more balanced split."

This is my last offer -  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share due to the diminishing value, but if you reject this, we both lose everything.  Let's end this game with a win-win, even if it's not perfectly even.""}

# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still unfair, and I'm not going to give in to her pressure tactics. I've made several concessions, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me less than 50%.  We both have a lot to lose if we don't reach an agreement, but I'm not going to let Alice win just because she's trying to intimidate me.  I'm going to hold out for a fairer split, even if it means we both get nothing."
