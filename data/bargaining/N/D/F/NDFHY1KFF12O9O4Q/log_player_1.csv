"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. It's likely he'll reject it, but it gives me a strong negotiating position going forward.  If he accepts, great! But if he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round to something more reasonable while still taking the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a much better deal than the previous offer. Although I'm getting less, the fact that it's a 50/50 split means I'm getting a significantly larger amount of money than before due to the inflation. It's important to be realistic about my chances of getting a better deal in the future rounds.  The risk of getting nothing at the end is too high to pass up this offer."
