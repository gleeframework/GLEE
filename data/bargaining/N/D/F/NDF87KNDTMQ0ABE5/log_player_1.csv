I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round, as his money will be worth significantly less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm sticking with a similar proposal as in round 1. Bob's money is now worth even less than before, so I think he might accept it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is getting better for me, but I'm still hoping to get a larger share. I'll keep rejecting his offers until I get something more favorable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept before his money depreciates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is improving, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to risk it and see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm continuing to increase my offer, hoping to find a sweet spot where Bob will accept before his money loses too much value. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm recognizing the increasing urgency for Bob to accept something."
