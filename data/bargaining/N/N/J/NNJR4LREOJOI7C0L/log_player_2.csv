It's round one, and I'm Bob. I can do better than a 40/60 split, even with the inflation. I want to see what Alice's next offer is."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still not ideal, and with the inflation factored in, it's not as attractive as her first offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
