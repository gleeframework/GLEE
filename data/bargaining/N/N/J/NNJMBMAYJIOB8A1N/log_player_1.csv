"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can negotiate further in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going all the way to 50/50 yet! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 70/30 split. I was hoping for a more even split, but I'll hold out for a better deal."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor, but still a decent compromise."

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

}
```
