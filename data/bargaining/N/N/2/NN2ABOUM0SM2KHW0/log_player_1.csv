Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor, Alice.  I figure it's a fair start considering the inflation factor favors me in future rounds.  Let's see what you think."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
