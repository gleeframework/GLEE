"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice is proposing to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer, as the game allows for negotiation and persuasion through the messages attached to each proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! How about this slight adjustment? It's better than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice is rejecting Bob's offer, choosing to proceed to the next round rather than accepting the division of $45 for herself and $55 for Bob. The decision is made considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money for both players and the strategic aspect of potentially getting a better offer in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice is proposing to take $58 and give Bob $42, with a message suggesting that this division is a compromise between their previous offers. The aim is to appear reasonable and increase the likelihood that Bob will accept this proposal, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting silly. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice is accepting Bob's offer to split the money evenly, with $50 going to each player. Given the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, especially for Alice, accepting this offer seems like the best option to ensure she receives a share before the money's value decreases further or the game ends with both players receiving nothing. The even split, although not initially what Alice aimed for, becomes a reasonable compromise under the circumstances."
