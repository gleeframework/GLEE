"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'm proposing to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking.

For Round 2, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice's gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79 (due to 5% inflation)

Since I'm getting less than I initially proposed, I'll accept Bob's offer.
