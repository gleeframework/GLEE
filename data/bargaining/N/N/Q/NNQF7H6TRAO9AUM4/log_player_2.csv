{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 6:4 split in my favor. While I understand your point about diminishing value, this offer reflects the fact that I'm taking the risk of the money losing more value in the next round.""}

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split of the remaining funds. Given the decreasing value of money, it seems reasonable to ensure both parties receive an equivalent share. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
