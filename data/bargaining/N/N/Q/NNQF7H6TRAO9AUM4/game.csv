600000.0,400000.0,I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This ensures a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I propose a 6:4 split in my favor. While I understand your point about diminishing value, this offer reflects the fact that I'm taking the risk of the money losing more value in the next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I propose an equal split of the remaining funds. Given the decreasing value of money, it seems reasonable to ensure both parties receive an equivalent share.",Alice,3,
