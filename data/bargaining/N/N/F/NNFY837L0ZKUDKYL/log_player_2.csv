{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe a 6:4 split is fairer, considering inflation will likely impact the value of the money more in later rounds. Let's agree to this now and avoid further potential losses.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation risk, I propose a 50/50 split to ensure both of us receive an equal amount without risking a larger loss in future rounds. This also promotes fairness in our division of the funds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
