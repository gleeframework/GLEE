Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest offer, and we both get a good amount before the value starts to decrease. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
