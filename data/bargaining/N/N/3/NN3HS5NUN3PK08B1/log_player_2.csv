"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is extremely unfair to Bob.  Even with inflation, one dollar is better than nothing.  Let's see if Alice will make a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
``` 
I propose a fair split of $50 for each of us.  This seems like the most logical way to divide the money."
