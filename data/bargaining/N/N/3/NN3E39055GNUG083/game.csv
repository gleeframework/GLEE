75.0,25.0,"I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem like a generous offer considering the first round, but please note that with each passing round, the money becomes less valuable due to inflation.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I can do better than 3:1. Let's try to find a better ratio.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Considering the value loss due to inflation, I propose a more balanced division of 60:40. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for the diminishing value of money as we progress through the rounds.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think I can still get a better deal. Let's try to find a sweet spot.",Bob,4,

55.0,45.0,"Considering the impact of inflation, I propose a division of 55:45. This offers a slight improvement over the previous round while still being mindful of the diminishing value of money. I hope this proposal will be acceptable.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the value of the money decreasing. I think it's time to aim for a more balanced split. Let's try to meet in the middle and split it 50/50.,Bob,6,
