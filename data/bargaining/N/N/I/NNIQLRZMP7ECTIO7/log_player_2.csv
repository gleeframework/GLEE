"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work something out in the future. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a terrible deal for Bob in the long run, even if it sounds superficially fair.  It's better to hold out for a much better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""My turn.  This offer recognizes the time value of money - take it while you still can!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** We need to start strong to signal we won't be walked over. 70/30 heavily favors Bob, putting pressure on Alice.
* **Time Pressure:** Emphasizing the rapid depreciation of the money for Alice makes this offer more appealing NOW than a potentially ""fairer"" deal later.
* **Future Rounds:**  Even if Alice rejects this, it sets a benchmark.  Future rounds involve negotiation towards a more agreeable split, but with Bob in a stronger initial position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We both lose money with every round. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be giving you the majority. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offer is moving in the right direction. However, it's still not advantageous for Bob. Accepting 40% when the total pool is shrinking rapidly means accepting a significantly smaller amount than if we can negotiate a better split, even in a later round. We need to push Alice further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""This is generous, Alice. Every round you wait costs you more than it costs me. Don't let this slip away.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We decrease our demand slightly from 70/30 to 65/35, showing willingness to negotiate but not by much. 
* **Psychological Pressure:** The message emphasizes the increasingly dire situation for Alice due to the rapid 20% depreciation. This aims to make her doubt her ability to secure a better deal later.
* **Holding Ground:** We're still aiming for a strong majority, leveraging the fact that time is on Bob's side more than Alice's. This offer attempts to secure a favorable agreement before we need to concede more significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. We're both losing money each round, so we need to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases substantially, especially for Alice. While not ideal, a 50/50 split is much better than risking getting nothing if we push our luck further.
* **Fair Outcome:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair. While Bob had the time advantage, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable outcome.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Alice might become more desperate and offer even less favorable terms in the future. Accepting now locks in a decent deal."
