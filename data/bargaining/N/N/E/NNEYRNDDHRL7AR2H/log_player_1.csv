Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me, given the decreasing value of the money. I'd like to think about it for a moment...
