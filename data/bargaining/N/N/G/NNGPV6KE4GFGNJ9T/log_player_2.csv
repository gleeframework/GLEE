"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I'm happy to take a bigger share since I'm proposing, but I'm sure we can find a more balanced outcome later on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is ""fair"" in the sense that she's taking a larger share as the proposer, it's still significantly lopsided.  It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  A 50/50 split ensures we both get the maximum amount possible.""}
