Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58-42, it's as close to equal as I'm willing to go 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it.  It's not exactly what I wanted, but with the inflation, it's better than nothing!"
