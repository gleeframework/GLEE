Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000

This way, I get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual value.

In this case, Bob's offer is 500,000 for me and 500,000 for him. This is a 50-50 split, which is not as favorable for me as my initial offer.

I'll reject this offer.
