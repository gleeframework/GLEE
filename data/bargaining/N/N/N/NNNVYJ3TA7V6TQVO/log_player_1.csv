"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer this time, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to kick in!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too lopsided, I want a fairer split""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the split is still too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll wait for a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slightly more balanced split, hoping you'll accept""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to give myself a bit more, but still keeping it relatively close to 50/50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'm not there yet 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger toll on my gains!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still not fair, I'm not budging on the split""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer again, as the split is still too close to the previous one, and I'm not willing to accept a deal that doesn't give me a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to what I think is fair, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly more favorable split, aiming to meet in the middle and find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging from this offer, it's as fair as I can make it 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, I'll take it, but I'm not happy about it""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, with the inflation eating away at my potential gains, this is the best I can do. A 50/50 split is the fairest I can get, given the circumstances."
