Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 80/20 seems reasonable.""
}

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't do much better than this, can you? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth $6,400.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

```

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
