"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's flip the script, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor.  Fair is fair!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55-45? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out, and the inflation is starting to bite. This offer is still better than what I was initially offered, and it's likely I won't get a better deal in the next round."
