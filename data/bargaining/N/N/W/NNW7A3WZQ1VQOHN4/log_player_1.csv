"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept Bob's offer this time, since it's a better deal than my previous one.
