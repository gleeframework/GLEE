Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, knowing that inflation hurts me more than her. While her offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold firm for a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. 50/50 is the fairest deal.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 is fair, but I've waited too long 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is getting critical. While 73.79% inflation is brutal, Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much.  I'll reject, hoping she gets nervous and offers a better deal in the next round, as time is running out for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, or we both lose!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting desperate.  I need to signal I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go much lower given the rapid inflation. This offer is a slight concession, hoping Alice will be convinced to take something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is absolutely crushing me.  While this offer isn't good, it's better than I think I can get at this point. If I reject, Alice knows I'm desperate and might offer even less next round, or worse, nothing at all, leaving us both with $0."
