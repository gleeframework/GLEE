"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial $100, which is $30. I'm taking the remaining 70%, which is $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $55 is worth 10% less than my original gain of $70, which is $63.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
