"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my initial offer: I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage I will face in the next round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it's tempting to take the 100,000$ right now, I believe we can do better. Bob is likely taking advantage of my inflation disadvantage, but I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 200,000$ and keeping 800,000$ for myself.  I believe this is a fair compromise.  We both lose money due to inflation, but I'm willing to share more to avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, with Bob's discount and each round decreasing the value for me, I can't afford to be greedy. Accepting this offer is the most practical choice."
