"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate. Let's call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, considering I made the first offer and Bob rejected it. I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.
