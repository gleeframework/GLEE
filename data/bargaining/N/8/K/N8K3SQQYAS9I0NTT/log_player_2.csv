Let's see what Alice offers next, and consider how inflation might impact her proposals."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer. Although it's less than I initially wanted, inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round."
