"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the original $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20% or $20. I'm trying to make a reasonable offer to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to fight 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $80 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $72.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a fair proposal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I accept the offer.
