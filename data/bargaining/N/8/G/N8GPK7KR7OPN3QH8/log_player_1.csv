Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: My turn, Alice.  How about we split a bit closer to even this time, considering the money will be worth less for you in the next round anyway? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
