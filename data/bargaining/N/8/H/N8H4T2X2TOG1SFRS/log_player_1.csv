Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair starting point, Alice. However, considering the inflation rates, I think a slightly more balanced split is more equitable for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
