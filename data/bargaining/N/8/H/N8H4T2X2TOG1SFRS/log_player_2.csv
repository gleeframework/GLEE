"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'll be losing more value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is fair in the first round, the 10% inflation Alice experiences means she'll be losing significantly more value in each subsequent round. This creates an incentive for me to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I appreciate the fair starting point, Alice. However, considering the inflation rates, I think a slightly more balanced split is more equitable for both of us in the long run.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hitting me harder. I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be more in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is more favorable to me than the 50/50 split she initially offered. The inflation will significantly impact her earnings more than mine, so I'm willing to compromise for a quicker resolution."
