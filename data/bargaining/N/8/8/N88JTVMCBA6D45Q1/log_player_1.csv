"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 

I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer.  I figure it's better to get something than nothing, and Bob might be tempted to take the small amount to avoid risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It seems Bob is being more reasonable now. I'll take the 50/50 split."
