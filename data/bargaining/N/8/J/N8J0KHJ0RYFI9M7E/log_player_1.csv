"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of 55 is worth 55 * 0.9 = 49.5, and Bob's gain of 45 is worth 45 * 0.95 = 42.75.

I accept this offer.
