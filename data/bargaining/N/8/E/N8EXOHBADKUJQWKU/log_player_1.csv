"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\nI made an offer to divide the $100, where I take $60 and Bob takes $40. I also included a message to Bob, suggesting that this division is fair, but slightly in my favor.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn. He can either accept my offer and we'll end the game, or he can reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round. Keep in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less for Bob, but its value remains the same for me.\n\nPlease relay my offer to Bob and let me know his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the inflation factor. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI rejected Bob's offer. Although Bob took into account the inflation factor, which reduces the value of his gain by 20% in each round, I believe I can get a better deal, especially since the money's value remains the same for me throughout the game.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round, where I'll make a new proposal for dividing the $100, considering the unchanged value of the money for me and the decreasing value for Bob. Please let me know when I can send my next offer.\n\n###\n###\nNext Round\nMy offer: {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nPlease relay my offer to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\nI made an offer to divide the $100, where I take $58 and Bob takes $42. Given that the value of the money remains constant for me but decreases by 20% for Bob with each round, I believe my offer is more than fair, especially considering the impact of inflation on Bob's gain.\n\nPlease relay my offer to Bob and let me know his response.\n\nKeep in mind that if Bob rejects this offer, the value of the money will decrease further for him in the next round, which might encourage him to accept my current proposal."
