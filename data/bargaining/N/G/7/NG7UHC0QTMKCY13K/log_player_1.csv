Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too tilted in your favor. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 55/45 split.  Time is money, and money is losing value! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
