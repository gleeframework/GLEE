"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'll get the better end of the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, I'm sure we can find a fair solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is trying to be all friendly and fair now!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $500,000 in this round is equivalent to $400,000 in the first round, which is a significant reduction. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected the same way, but I'll assume it is.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. My initial instinct is to reject it, but I don't want to burn any bridges. Let me think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is biting, and my offer needs to reflect that. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You rejected my first offer, now it's your turn to pay the price of inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a bit less than in the previous round, but I'm keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a bit snarky, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to take a bit less than half, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate again!

Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $400,000 in this round is equivalent to approximately $666,667 in the first round.
Bob's gain of $600,000 in this round is equivalent to approximately $800,000 in the first round.

Considering the inflation, my gain is still a significant reduction, but Bob's gain is closer to the original amount. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected the same way, but I'll assume it is.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. My initial instinct is to reject it, but I don't want to burn any bridges. Let me think for a moment...

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any younger, Bob. Time to make a decision!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit less than in the previous round, but I'm keeping $550,000 for myself. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me halfway again!

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really taking a toll now! My offer needs to reflect that. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""You've rejected all my offers, now it's time for a 50/50 split. Don't say I didn't warn you!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the inflation. The message is a bit snarky, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting the deal."
