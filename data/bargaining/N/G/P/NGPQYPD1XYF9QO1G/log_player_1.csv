"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good starting point. I'll give you a fair share, but I'm aiming for the majority.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing for the majority, but I'm not giving up yet. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

My gain in Round 1 was $700,000, which is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's 0.9 * $700,000 = $630,000.

Bob's offer in Round 2 is $200,000, which is 20% of the original $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer.

Considering the inflation, I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting this offer. I'll make a counteroffer to meet you in the middle, but I want a bit more.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation again, my gain from the previous round ($630,000) is now worth 90% of its value, so it's 0.9 * $630,000 = $567,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the current $900,000 (due to inflation), and Bob will get 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, but I'm still willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it down the middle, but I'll give you a slight edge. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

My gain in Round 1 was $700,000, which is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so it's 0.729 * $700,000 = $509,130.

Bob's offer in Round 4 is $450,000, which is 45% of the original $1,000,000. This is a bit better than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Considering the inflation and my previous offers, I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's split it down the middle. I'll take $450,000.""
}
```"
