30.0,70.0,"Alice, that's a very generous offer for yourself, but hardly fair to me. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This accounts for the time value of money, as it's my turn to propose.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Okay, I see your point about the time value of money. Let's meet in the middle with a 65/35 split in my favor. It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation.",Alice,3,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more balanced split.  However, we're running out of time, and the value of the money is decreasing, particularly for you. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, we're both losing money with every round. Let's compromise with a 55/45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and we can finally move on from this negotiation.",Alice,5,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, we're both losing a lot of money here. We've both made concessions, and the value is rapidly decreasing for me. Let's split the money evenly at 50/50. It's the fairest and most practical solution at this point.",Alice,7,
