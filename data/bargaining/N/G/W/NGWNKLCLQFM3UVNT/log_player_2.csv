"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. This way, we both get something and we can move on to other things.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, that's a very generous offer for yourself, but hardly fair to me. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This accounts for the time value of money, as it's my turn to propose.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point about the time value of money. Let's meet in the middle with a 65/35 split in my favor. It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more balanced split.  However, we're running out of time, and the value of the money is decreasing, particularly for you. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round. Let's compromise with a 55/45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and we can finally move on from this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about the urgency, her offer still heavily favors her.  I need to push for a larger share while it's still advantageous for her to settle.  The inflation is working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we need to settle this quickly. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in *my* favor.  Given the time pressure and decreasing value, it's a fair compromise.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm mirroring Alice's previous offer but shifting the advantage to myself.  This puts the pressure on her to either accept a less favorable deal or risk even further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing a lot of money here. We've both made concessions, and the value is rapidly decreasing for me. Let's split the money evenly at 50/50. It's the fairest and most practical solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I could hold out for a slightly larger share, Alice is right about the diminishing returns. Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees me a decent amount, whereas continued negotiation carries the risk of getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in time."
