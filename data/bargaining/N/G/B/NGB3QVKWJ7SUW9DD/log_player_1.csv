"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your sense of fairness is a bit skewed by the inflation. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I'll reject this offer because, due to inflation, my share is now worth less than Bob's, even if the nominal amount is the same. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair.""}\n\n### I'll increase my share to 58% to account for the decreased value due to inflation, and offer Bob 42%."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is working against you, Alice. Let's settle this before it gets worse for you. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### Given that the money I gain is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll accept Bob's offer. Prolonging the game further would only decrease the value of my share, making this offer the best I can get under the circumstances."
