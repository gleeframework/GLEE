"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 
 
I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I think it's a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While I appreciate the offer, the 20% inflation has significantly impacted the value of my potential gain. I will reject this offer and propose my own in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

Given the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I propose a 50/50 split. This is the most equitable option in the current situation."
