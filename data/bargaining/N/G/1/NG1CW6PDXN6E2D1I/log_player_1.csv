Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more balanced split, considering we're just starting out and don't know how inflation will affect us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
