I'm still trying to get the best deal.  Even though the money is worth less for Bob, he's still getting a bigger share than I think is fair.  I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round!"

I'm accepting this offer. Even though it's not ideal, it's better than getting nothing at all.  Bob is getting a much larger share, but I've realized that I need to be more realistic with my expectations. I've been too focused on getting a larger share, and it's cost me.  I'm not sure if I would have accepted this in earlier rounds, but I'm glad I didn't hold out for too much longer."
