"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, and Bob is trying to take advantage of it!

I'm not willing to give up 50% of the remaining money, especially since it's worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing, I'll try to get a better deal. Since Bob was willing to offer 50% in the previous round, I'll try to negotiate a bit more. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, trying to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer."
