"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'd rather get a larger share now to make up for the loss in value.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the significant loss in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth much less, I'd rather get a larger share now to make up for the loss in value.

However, Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, and I'm not sure if I want to accept it.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to make a more aggressive move to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm trying to get a larger share now, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is plummeting! Bob's offer is extremely lopsided, and I'm not sure if I want to accept it.

However, considering the rapidly decreasing value of money, I might be better off taking what I can get now rather than risking another round of inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
