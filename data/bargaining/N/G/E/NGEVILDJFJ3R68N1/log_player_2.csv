"Round 1

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting me hard, Bob.  I need a better deal than that to make it worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make another offer. The inflation is indeed hitting Alice hard, but I think I can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I know inflation is affecting you, but I'm not immune to getting a good deal. This is my best offer yet.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day.  Any more rounds and the inflation will eat up all the gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a reasonable offer, considering the inflation is severely impacting Alice's gains. Splitting it down the middle seems like a fair compromise at this point."
