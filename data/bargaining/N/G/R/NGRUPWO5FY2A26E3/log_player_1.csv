Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob!"

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on me! My gain is worth a lot less now.

Considering the numbers, Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I'll have to think carefully.

After some thought, I'll...
