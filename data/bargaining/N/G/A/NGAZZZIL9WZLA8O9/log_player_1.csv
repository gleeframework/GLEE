"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to keep 9000 dollars and give Bob 1000 dollars.  I want to start with a fair, but not too generous, offer to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I'm losing value each round, I'm losing it at a faster rate than Bob.  If I accept now, I'm getting a significantly worse deal than I offered him in the first round. I'll see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I propose to keep $8000 and give Bob $2000.  I'm willing to give up more this time, hoping that Bob sees the value of negotiating rather than continuing to push for a lopsided deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While the inflation is hitting me harder, I'm still losing a significant amount of money with each passing round.  I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives me only 2000 dollars, especially with the potential to get more in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering 7000 for myself and 3000 for Bob.  I'm continuing to reduce my share, but also increasing Bob's, hoping to find a middle ground before the inflation makes things even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob is clearly trying to secure a larger share,  I'm still losing value at a faster rate than him.  I'm hoping we can reach a more balanced agreement before the inflation makes it impossible to reach a deal that's fair to both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob. With each round, the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to reach a deal, so I'm making a significant concession hoping Bob will see the value of finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Even though the inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money, I'm not willing to settle for only $4000. I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value of a more balanced deal before we both end up with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  With the inflation continuing to escalate, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing.  We need to find a solution before it's too late, and a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option at this point."
