Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 4000 is now worth 80% of its original value, while Bob's gain of 6000 is still the same. This offer is not as favorable to me as the previous one, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer.
