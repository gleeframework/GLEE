"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round.  I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  It's risky, but since the money depreciates faster for him, it might be a good strategy to get him to accept early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to settle for such a small share, especially since the money is worth the same for me.  I'll reject this offer and see if he comes back with something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll offer Bob 40% this round.  It's a better deal than his previous offer, but I'm still keeping the majority.  Hopefully, this will convince him to accept before the inflation gets too out of control."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is hurting him more than it's hurting me. I'm going to keep rejecting his offers and see if he'll come back with something more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to up my offer again to 70% for me and 30% for Bob. It's a big jump from my previous offer, but I think it's the sweet spot to make him think about accepting before the inflation gets even worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a great deal for me, considering the inflation.  Bob is finally offering an even split, and the money is worth significantly less for him.  I'll take it!"
