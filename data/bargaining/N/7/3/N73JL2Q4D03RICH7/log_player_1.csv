**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round. Waiting longer means getting even less.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently rejected offers where he receives less than $520,000. It's unlikely he'll concede much more, especially as time goes on.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer risks getting an even worse deal in a later round where the money is worth even less to me. Accepting guarantees a reasonable, though not perfect, sum."
