Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where I can propose a deal that benefits me.  I'm taking a slight hit with the inflation, and you're getting a decent deal considering it's only going down from here for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
