Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently using the dwindling time and inflation against me.  While my gains are diminishing, I still have several rounds to go and she's not offering a significantly better deal than before.  I need to show firmness to improve my position, otherwise, she'll keep pushing for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is it - a fair and equal split. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains even more.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make a strong move and propose a 50/50 split. This accomplishes a few things:

* **Shows Strength:**  After rejecting her offers, proposing an even split demonstrates I'm serious about getting a fair deal.
* **Time Pressure:** With the remaining rounds diminishing, the pressure is on Alice to accept a reasonable offer.
* **Simplicity:** A 50/50 split is easy to understand and eliminates the need for complex negotiations.

If Alice is rational, she'll understand that rejecting this offer risks her walking away with nothing as the value continues to decrease for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and your share is shrinking fast 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but time is running out. While Alice's offer isn't great, rejecting it means risking even further losses due to inflation.  She's clearly leveraging the dwindling rounds to her advantage. Accepting now guarantees at least something, whereas continuing the game holds the potential of walking away with nothing."
