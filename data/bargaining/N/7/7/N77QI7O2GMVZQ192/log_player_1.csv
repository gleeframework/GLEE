"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have taken the 50/50 split, now you'll get less 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the 10% reduction in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me $400,000 when I could have had $500,000 in the previous round. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect much more""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, giving Bob $550,000 and keeping $450,000 for myself."
