Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob.  Let's compromise. I'll take 5500, you take 4500. It's a fair deal considering inflation is hitting you harder. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
