"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a fair compromise, I'd rather try to get a better deal to account for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a good deal to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal to compensate for the reduced purchasing power due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, my potential gain is worth even less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a fair compromise, I still think I can do better to account for the significant reduction in the value of my potential gain due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get closer to a fair share considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal to compensate for the significant reduction in the value of my potential gain due to inflation."
