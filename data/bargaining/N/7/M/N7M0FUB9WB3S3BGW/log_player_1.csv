Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is being slightly more ""generous,"" the deal is still heavily skewed in his favor due to inflation.  We need to apply more pressure, as waiting benefits him significantly more than it does us.  We are aiming to get Bob nervous enough about time running out that he'll accept a less favorable deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option, especially with how much inflation is hurting things.  Take it or leave it - my next offer won't be this generous.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and Bob needs to feel the heat. A firm stance is necessary.
* **50/50 Appearanc**e: While not ideal due to inflation, offering a 50/50 split makes us look reasonable and puts the onus on Bob to appear greedy if he rejects it.
* **Threat:**  We hint at being less generous in the future, putting additional pressure on Bob to accept this offer."
