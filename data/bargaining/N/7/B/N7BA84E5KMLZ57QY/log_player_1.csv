"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, 4:1 ratio""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, with me getting 80$ and Bob getting 20$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 1:1 split, a fair and simple approach 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 47.5$ (100 * 0.95 = 95, then 95 * 0.5 = 47.5).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
