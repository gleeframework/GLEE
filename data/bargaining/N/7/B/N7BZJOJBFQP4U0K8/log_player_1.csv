"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so the total amount is now $8,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Consider this offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a significant portion of the remaining amount, but I'm hoping he'll think it's a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference.  This is the last offer I'm making before the value of the money drops further. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is dropping rapidly! I need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $3,000 is a decent amount, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value. This seems like a reasonable compromise."
