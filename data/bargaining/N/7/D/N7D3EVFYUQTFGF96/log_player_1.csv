"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it more evenly. Let's try this instead. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'm not willing to accept $4500, which is now equivalent to $3600 in the first round's value. I'll make a new proposal in the next round to try to get a better deal."

I also included a message to Bob explaining that I need a bit more due to the 20% decrease in value for me, and I'm hoping he'll understand and accept this proposal. Let me know how Bob responds!"
