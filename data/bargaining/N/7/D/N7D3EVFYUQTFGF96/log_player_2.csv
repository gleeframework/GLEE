Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I need a bit more due to inflation, let's try this 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it.  It's not ideal, but the inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk getting even less."
