Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's now my turn again. Here's my new proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll give you a bit more.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this to Bob."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI already sent my new proposal in the previous message. Here it is again:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll give you a bit more.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\nIf you'd like, I can explain my reasoning behind the offer. I took into account the fact that the money is worth 5% less to Bob each round, and 0% less to me. Since we're now in Round 3, Bob's share would be worth 10% less than the original amount (5% less in Round 2, and another 5% less in Round 3). I've adjusted my offer to reflect this, while still trying to find a mutually acceptable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'll take 55 and you take 45.  It's the best we can do with inflation biting into my share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer again.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's now my turn again. Here's my new proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to consider my own interests too.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this to Bob.\n\n###\n\nMy reasoning behind this offer is similar to before. Since the money is worth 14.26% less to Bob, I'm trying to find a balance between our interests. I've increased Bob's share slightly, while still prioritizing my own gain. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I already sent my new proposal in the previous message. Here it is again:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to consider my own interests too.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\nIf you'd like, I can explain my reasoning behind the offer again. I took into account the fact that the money is worth 14.26% less to Bob, and 0% less to me. Since we're now in Round 5, Bob's share would be worth even less than before. I've adjusted my offer to reflect this, while still trying to find a mutually acceptable division. I'm trying to balance our interests and find a compromise that works for both of us."
