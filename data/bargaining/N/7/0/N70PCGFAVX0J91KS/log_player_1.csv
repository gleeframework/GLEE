Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I'm willing to give you 450,000, but I need to get at least 550,000 to make it worthwhile given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
