Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on Bob, don't be greedy 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's split it right down the middle.  50/50.  Time is running out!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You know the money is losing value for you, don't wait! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer means I'm losing significantly more than half of the original value due to inflation.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to remain firm in hopes of getting a better deal in the later rounds, even if it means risking a smaller gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but it needs to be reasonable for both of us.  This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to make a strong stand and offer a compromise that is slightly favorable to Alice but still acceptable for me considering the increasing inflation.  Calling it my ""final offer"" adds pressure and might persuade Alice to accept before the value diminishes further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Be realistic, my share has to be bigger 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me.  While this offer isn't ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject. Accepting now guarantees me something, whereas continuing to hold out could result in walking away with nothing."
