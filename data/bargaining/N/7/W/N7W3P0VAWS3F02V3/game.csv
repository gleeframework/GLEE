950000.0,50000.0,"Let's wrap this up quickly. 950,000 for me and 50,000 for you. It's a generous offer considering the inflation!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly. Take 450,000, and I'll take 550,000. It's a fair deal considering inflation will hit my share harder.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer.  700,000 for me and 300,000 for you.  Inflation is eating away at your potential gains with every passing round. Take the deal now before it gets worse!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, we need to find a compromise.  I'm willing to take a bit less, but I need a fairer share than your previous offer. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking 600,000 and you taking 400,000. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and we can avoid further losses from inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you 350,000, which is a lot more than you'd get if you keep stalling.  Agree now, or I'll have to offer you even less next round!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I'm not going to let inflation completely ruin my share.  I'm offering 450,000 for myself, and 550,000 for you.  This is a fair deal considering the continued losses from inflation. It's time to stop being stubborn and agree to a reasonable solution.",Bob,6,
