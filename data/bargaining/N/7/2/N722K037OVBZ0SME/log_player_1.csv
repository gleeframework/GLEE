Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a good starting point. I'm willing to be generous, but I also want to get the most I can! Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer. Let's accept it!"
