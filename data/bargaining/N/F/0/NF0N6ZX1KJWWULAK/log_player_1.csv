"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This gives Bob a small share, but I want to secure a large portion early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try a 60/40 split.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but I still want to secure a majority share.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  With the inflation rate, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  A 50/50 split seems like a fair compromise, given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a more equitable split. 
The inflation rate is significant, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal. 
I'm confident that I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm going to offer a 40/60 split in Bob's favor.  I'm realizing that I may have been too stubborn in my previous rounds.  This offer acknowledges that Bob has been the more aggressive negotiator and gives him the majority share. I'm hoping that this will convince Bob to accept and avoid further rounds of inflation."
