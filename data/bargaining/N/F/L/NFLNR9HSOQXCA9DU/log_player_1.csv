"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split. I'm offering you a fair share, but I need a little more to make it worthwhile for me. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
