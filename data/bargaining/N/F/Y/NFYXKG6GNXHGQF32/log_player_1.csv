  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent chunk""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous amount considering I'm keeping 60 dollars for myself. My message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.
