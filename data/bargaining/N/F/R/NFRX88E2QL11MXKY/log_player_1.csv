"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need to overcomplicate things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the new values are:

* Alice's gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
