"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose that I get $9000 and Bob gets $1000. This ensures a fair distribution, even though I am getting a larger share, and gives Bob some incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still leaving a significant gap between our gains. This should incentivize Bob to accept, given that the money is losing value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but still maintaining a substantial lead.  The inflation is becoming more significant, and I need to be more aggressive in securing a good share before it erodes too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm further reducing my share, but still keeping a comfortable margin. The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and we're getting closer to the deadline. I need to secure a deal quickly before things get worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
The inflation is impacting Bob more than me. He's desperate now, and his offer still isn't good enough for me. I can likely get more if I keep rejecting and counter-proposing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is getting serious, and it's time for a compromise. I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option at this point. It ensures we both get a decent amount and avoids the risk of both of us getting nothing due to further inflation."
