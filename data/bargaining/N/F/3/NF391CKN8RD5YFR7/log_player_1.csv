"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

Round 2

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the offer is now:

* Alice gain: $400,000
* Bob gain: $600,000

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.
