"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the initial $100, but still leaving Bob with a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, I'll try to counter! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money I gain is worth 95% of the initial amount, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of the initial amount.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a big swing in your favor, Bob! I'm not ready to give up yet.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and choosing to proceed to the next round."

Here's my new offer:
