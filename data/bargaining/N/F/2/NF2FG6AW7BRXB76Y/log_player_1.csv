Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  It's closer to an even split, and since we're both taking a risk by rejecting the previous offer, I think this is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
