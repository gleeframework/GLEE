"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'm offering you a good share, but we need to work together to avoid losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less than the initial amount, and I'm getting 45% of the remaining $10,000, I'll calculate the actual amount I'll get:

$10,000 * 0.95 (inflation) = $9,500 (effective amount)
$9,500 * 0.45 (Alice's share) = $4,275

This is less than the initial $8,000 I offered in Round 1, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation effect.

Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount, considering the inflation effect.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50/50 and avoid further negotiations.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 50% of the remaining effective amount, and Bob will get the other 50%."
