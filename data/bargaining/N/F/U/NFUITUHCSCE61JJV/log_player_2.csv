"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn! I'll make a counteroffer. My proposal: 60 for me, 40 for Alice. Your gain will be worth 5% less, and mine will be worth 20% less if we proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Alice's decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Alice's decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  We both lose value with each round.  A 50/50 split is fair in this situation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take the 50/50 split. With the inflation, I'm already losing 36% of the value, so it's better to take the offer now rather than risking further loss."
