Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 99/1 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will take the small share rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in later rounds.  Bob is being reasonable, and the inflation will hurt his share more than mine."
