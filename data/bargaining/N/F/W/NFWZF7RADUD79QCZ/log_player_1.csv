"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, giving myself the larger share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't accept this offer. It's a huge swing in my favor, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split in my favor. The inflation is starting to bite, so I'm offering a slightly smaller share to Bob than in the first round. However, I'm still confident that this is a fair offer, given that I'm taking on a greater risk by rejecting his proposal in the previous round. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous! Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to get a massively favorable deal. I'm not going to let him take advantage of me like this. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm offering a 65/35 split in my favor. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid the further negative effects of inflation.  I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in settling before the money becomes even less valuable."
