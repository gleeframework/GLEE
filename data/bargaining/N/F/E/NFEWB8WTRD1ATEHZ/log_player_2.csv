"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. However, I believe I can negotiate a better deal than a 60-40 split.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to Alice than a 50-50 split, considering the inflation rates. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to reach an agreement quickly, but I also want to negotiate a fair deal.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's aim for a mutually beneficial split.""}"
