"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with. What do you think?""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, giving us both $5,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and we can reassess as we go along."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping a bit more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with the 40/60 split, and I'm not sure I want to give Bob a bigger share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

I'm trying to find a middle ground by giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting a bit frustrated with the offers that are getting more and more skewed towards Bob's favor. The 35/65 split is not acceptable to me, especially considering the inflation is working against me. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

I'm trying to find a compromise again, but this time I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share to account for the increasing inflation. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

I'm really struggling with the 30/70 split, especially considering the inflation is taking a significant toll on my share. I'm not willing to accept this offer, even if it's Bob's ""last offer"". I'll try to negotiate one more time, hoping to get a better deal before the game ends."
