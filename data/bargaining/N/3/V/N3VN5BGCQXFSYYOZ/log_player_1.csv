"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I should aim for a higher share to compensate for the relative decrease in value.

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Taking into account the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
