**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While my potential gains are rapidly decreasing, she's sticking to offers where she benefits significantly more.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means taking a risk in the later rounds."

The inflation is killing me!  At this point, accepting Alice's offer, even though it's heavily skewed in her favor, is better than getting nothing in the end.  I have to be realistic about how much the inflation is hurting my position."
