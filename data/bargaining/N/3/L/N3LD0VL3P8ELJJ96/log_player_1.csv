I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer. I figure I'm better off trying to secure a larger share early on.  Let's see if Bob is willing to play along!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

It's better to take a 50/50 split now than to risk getting nothing at all.  I'm not sure what Bob's strategy is, but I'm not going to push my luck any further."
