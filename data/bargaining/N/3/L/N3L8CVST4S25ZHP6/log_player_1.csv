Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we can both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather not split the money evenly, especially since I'm getting a smaller share due to the inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.
