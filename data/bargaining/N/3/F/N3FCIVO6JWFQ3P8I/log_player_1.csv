"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since Bob's offer is $6,000 for me and $4,000 for him, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself to make this worthwhile""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more uneven split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. My message is a bit more assertive, reflecting my desire to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'll meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since Bob's offer is $5,000 for me and $5,000 for him, it's a 50/50 split. Given the circumstances, I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and get some money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
