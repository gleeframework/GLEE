"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 90% and you get 10% for now. We can negotiate further if you want more.""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm trying to get a good chunk of the money upfront. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than a 45% split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 45% is enough for me. Can you consider a 50/50 split or slightly more?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is eating away at the value of the money, so I need to be strategic about my next offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 60% now, but I think it's a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to 60%, but I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation. Let's finish this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is mirroring my previous offer, but with a slightly different split. Considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain by 14.26% compared to the initial amount, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer.

Since Bob is willing to go up to 60%, and I was already offering 60% in the previous round, I'll decide to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential future losses due to inflation.
