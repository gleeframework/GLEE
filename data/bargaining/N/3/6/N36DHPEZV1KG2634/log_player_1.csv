"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the offer from Bob is actually equivalent to:

# Alice gain: 4500 (5000 / 1.1)
# Bob gain: 4545.45 (5000 / 1.1)

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less after two rounds, it's now worth 90% of its original value. My new offer is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, considering the 27.1% reduction in value:

# Alice gain: 4000 / (1 - 0.271) = 4000 / 0.729 ≈ 5493.88
# Bob gain: 6000 / (1 - 0.271) = 6000 / 0.729 ≈ 8223.49

I'll reject this offer, as it's not in my favor. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less after four rounds, it's now worth 72.9% of its original value. My new offer is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7290,
  ""bob_gain"": 2710
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, considering the 40.95% reduction in value:

# Alice gain: 3000 / (1 - 0.4095) = 3000 / 0.5905 ≈ 5081.35
# Bob gain: 7000 / (1 - 0.4095) = 7000 / 0.5905 ≈ 11851.41

I'll reject this offer, as it's not in my favor.
