"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the current value. If I accept the offer, I'll get $3,000, which is worth $3,000 in the first round.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 70% to 30%, I'll aim for a more balanced proposal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the total amount, which is $5,500, and Bob gets 45%, which is $4,500."
