"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's the best way to ensure we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, my effective gains are:

Alice gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750
Bob gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500

I think this is a fair offer, considering the changing values of the money. I accept Bob's offer.
