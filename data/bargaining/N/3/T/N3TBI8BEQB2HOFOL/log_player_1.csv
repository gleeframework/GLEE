"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate, let's move on to the next round!""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can move on to the next round where we can try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 in the first round is still worth $5,000, but Bob's gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it because I think I can do better. I'd rather not settle for $4,000 when I could potentially get more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for $6,000, and my gain in the previous round was $4,000, I'll try to negotiate for a higher amount for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's gain is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it again. I think I can still do better, especially since my gain in the previous round was $5,500, and I'm not willing to settle for $4,500.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for $5,500, and my gain in the previous round was $5,500, I'll try to maintain my current gain and see if Bob will accept it. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging from this number, take it or leave it.""
}
```"
