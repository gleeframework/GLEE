"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward division. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more, huh?

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the 20% reduction in value due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to adjust the ratio in my favor. Considering the 20% reduction in value due to inflation, I'll propose a 55/45 split, which is a slightly more favorable ratio for me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 45, but I think I deserve more!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my desired amount, but I still think I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns. Considering the 48.8% reduction in value due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In this round, I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a slight improvement from the previous rounds. I'll take the 45 and call it a day.
