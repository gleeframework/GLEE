"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better split.  Let's move towards a more equal division, but I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share to compensate for the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting the value of the money, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards his favor, but I'm willing to compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation affecting the money's value, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and share the risk of inflation equally.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which should be more appealing to Bob after his previous offer."
