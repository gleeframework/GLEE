Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to account for the inflation difference. This split is fairer considering the devaluation of our money. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving in the right direction, this offer is still not favorable to me (Bob). The inflation disparity means I need a significantly larger share in the earlier rounds to make this deal worthwhile."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. Let's be reasonable. This offer gives you a significant share, and it's the best we can do given the inflation rate.  We both need to accept some compromise, or we'll lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, as the pressure is mounting. However, Alice's offer is worse than her round 3 offer! She's trying to take advantage of the shrinking pot. I need to hold firm and show I'm serious about getting a fair share, or she'll continue lowballing me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 620000,
""alice_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. You're trying to backtrack on your previous offers, and we're running out of time. I'm sticking with a 62/38 split. Take it or leave it -  we both lose if this goes on.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing out with each passing round. Let's end this stalemate and split the money evenly. This is the fairest solution considering the rapid inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is finally being realistic.  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the smartest move. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting a worse offer or, even worse, walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
