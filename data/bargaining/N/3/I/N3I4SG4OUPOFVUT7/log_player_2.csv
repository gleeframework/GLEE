Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to a reasonable split.  Accept this now or we risk losing a significant amount of money. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but her offer is getting worse for Bob with each round due to inflation. While she claims it's her final offer, there's no guarantee she won't negotiate further as the deadline approaches and the risk of getting nothing increases for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but this needs to be fair. I'm making a final offer – let's wrap this up and avoid a total loss.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is mounting with only six rounds left. Bob needs to convey urgency and firmness. By presenting this as his ""final offer,"" he aims to push Alice towards a more agreeable split while still maintaining a slightly advantageous position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm giving you one last chance. This is a fair offer considering the time constraint.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical.  While the offer is far from ideal, rejecting it carries a massive risk. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** Only 6 rounds remain, and Alice is clearly playing tough. There's a real chance she won't budge, and Bob will be left with even worse offers as inflation eats further into his potential gains.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Inflation is heavily impacting Bob. Accepting $400,000 now, even if unfair, is significantly better than accepting a slightly better offer in later rounds that will be worth considerably less due to inflation. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  While she claims this is her ""last chance"" offer, there's no guarantee she'll actually follow through. She might be bluffing, but Bob can't bank on that.

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but at this point, accepting a less than ideal offer is the most rational choice to avoid walking away with nothing."
