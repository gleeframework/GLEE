"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's try for a better split next round 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is worth 90% of the original $6,000 I proposed in the first round, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of the original $4,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You said meet in the middle last round, so let's try to meet in the middle this time""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My $5,500 offer in the previous round is now worth 73.9% of the original $6,000, and Bob's offer of $7,000 is worth 175% of the original $4,000. That's a huge difference.

I'm not sure if I want to give up such a large share of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, but I'll also consider the fact that Bob is willing to compromise. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You're willing to compromise, I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need something substantial""
}
```"
