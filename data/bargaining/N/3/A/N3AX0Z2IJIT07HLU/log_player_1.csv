"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering that the money is worth 20% less to him in each subsequent round. This way, Bob has an incentive to accept the offer rather than risking a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get more if we negotiate a little. I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share if you accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer because it gives me a smaller share than what I initially offered him. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I have no incentive to accept a worse deal. I'll make a new offer in the next round to try to get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less than before, considering the inflation. This is a fair offer, given the circumstances.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, taking into account that the money is worth less to him due to inflation. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and taking advantage of the situation to get a better deal. I believe this offer is still relatively generous, considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob."
