"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large share, but it's still fair given the inflation rates and the fact that I'm proposing first.  Let's see if Bob takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is significantly worse for me than the first round, even with the inflation considered. I'm not giving up this much money so easily.  I'll make a better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still trying to get a good share, but I'm also aware that the inflation is hurting me more than Bob. This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, while still leaving a decent amount for Bob. Hopefully, he'll see the value in this and accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is still pretty bad, but with the inflation rates, I'm losing so much money every round.  I'd rather have $400,000 than risk getting even less in future rounds.  Time to cut my losses."
