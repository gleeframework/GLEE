Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

}"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about this offer...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more this round.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle this round, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to even things out.

Considering the significant drop in value due to inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
