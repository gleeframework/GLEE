Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer,  hoping to get the deal done quickly. I'll take 990,000, and leave Bob with 10,000.  Let's see if he's willing to accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm disappointed that my initial offer was rejected, I'm happy to accept a 50/50 split.  With inflation, my initial offer isn't as valuable as it was, and a fair split is the best outcome now."
