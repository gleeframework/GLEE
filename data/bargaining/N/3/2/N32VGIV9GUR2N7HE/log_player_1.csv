Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60-40. The money is worth less for you now, so this is a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
