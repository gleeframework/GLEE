Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. This way, we can both get a decent share and still have room for negotiation in future rounds."

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now looking at a reduced value of 70% of the original $100. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make up for the inflation!""
}
