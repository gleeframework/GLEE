Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a better split for us both, considering the inflation. We can both still get a decent amount and avoid the risk of getting nothing.""}

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not happy with that split. Let's see if we can work something out that's more equitable for both of us."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The clock is ticking, and we both lose if we don't agree. I'm offering a slight compromise, but this is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal, I need to accept this offer. The inflation is hitting me hard, and I risk getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other's proposals."
