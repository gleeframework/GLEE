"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller majority, but I think this is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not convinced that it's a good deal for me. I was hoping to get a bigger share of the initial 10,000, and this offer is still quite far from that.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slight majority. Let's try again""}

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the total amount, which is $7,500, and Bob gets 25%, which is $2,500. I'm hoping this offer is more reasonable for Bob and that he'll be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight majority, but I think this is a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the fact that I'm getting a smaller share of the pie. However, I do think that Bob's offer is a bit more balanced than his previous ones.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not thrilled about it.
