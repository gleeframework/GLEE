"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer seems generous, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Rejecting allows Bob to make the offer in the next round, potentially getting a better deal as the money depreciates for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair split.  Let's make a quick decision before the money loses more value!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't take my first offer, now you have to give me a bit more! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is still not ideal, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  The money is losing value rapidly, and continuing to reject offers could lead to a worse outcome in future rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable amount of money for Bob, even with the reduced value."
