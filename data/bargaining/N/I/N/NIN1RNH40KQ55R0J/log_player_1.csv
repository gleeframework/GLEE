"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you a fair split.  Let's make a quick decision before the money loses more value! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me in Round 2!

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll stick to my guns and wait for a better deal. The money is still worth 95% of its original value, and I'm not willing to give up as much as Bob is proposing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You didn't take my first offer, now you have to give me a bit more!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give myself a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
