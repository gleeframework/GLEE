Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm happy to go with 60/40 in my favor.

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more fair.  Let's get this over with.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is hitting us both hard, so a 50/50 split seems the fairest option now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm losing a bit more to inflation than Alice, it's still a good deal to take a 50/50 split. The longer we go on, the less money we both end up with, so this is the best option."
