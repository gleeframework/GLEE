"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while still providing a significant amount for Bob. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While the offer seems reasonable, it's important to consider the inflation and the fact that we have 12 rounds.  Rejecting gives me the opportunity to propose a more favorable division later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split, with 55% for me and 45% for you. This still gives you a substantial share, while also acknowledging my need to gain more in order to compensate for the inflation.""}
