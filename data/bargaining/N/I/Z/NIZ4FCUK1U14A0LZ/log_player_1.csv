"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split, with 55% for me and 45% for you. This still gives you a substantial share, while also acknowledging my need to gain more in order to compensate for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
