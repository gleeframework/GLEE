"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you 20% of the total. Accept and we can split the cash!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous.  This is a fair split, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a split that gives Bob a larger share than me, especially since the money I gain is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of the money I gain due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A more modest proposal this time. I'll give you 30% and take the rest. Think it's a fair deal?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the total, and I'll take the remaining $700,000."
