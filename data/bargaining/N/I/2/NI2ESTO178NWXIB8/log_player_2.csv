"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While I lose 36% of the value of my initial offer, Alice loses 19% of hers. 
* **Relative Gains:** While Alice's offer is slightly lower for me than her initial proposal, it's still a good gain. Considering the inflation factor, I'm gaining more in real terms compared to what I'd get by rejecting and risking the next round.
* **Risk of Rejection:** There's no guarantee Alice will accept my proposal in the next round, and her offer is likely to be even lower due to further inflation.

By accepting, I secure a decent amount of money, even with the inflation effect."
