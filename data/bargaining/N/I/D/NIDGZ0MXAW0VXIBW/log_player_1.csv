"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split, which is still favorable to you but closer to an even split.  We can avoid more rounds and wasted money this way. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
