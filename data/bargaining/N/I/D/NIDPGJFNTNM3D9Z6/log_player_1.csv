"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, the money is now split 50-50, which is a fair division. However, considering the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of the original amount, which is $950,000, while Bob's gain of $500,000 is still worth $500,000.

I'll accept this offer.
