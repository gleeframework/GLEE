"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. This way, I'll get $6,000, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the new values.

For Round 2, my gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of the original $6,000 (since it's 5% less due to inflation), which is $5,700.

For Bob's gain of $5,000, it's worth 80% of the original $4,000 (since it's 20% less due to inflation), which is $4,000.

Considering the adjusted values, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
