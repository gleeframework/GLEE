"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a clean slate, Bob. I'll take the whole $100 this round, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This is a bold opening move, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting the negotiations started early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the $100 evenly this round. It's fair and ensures both of us benefit equally. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair proposal from Bob! However, I'm not sure if I want to give up my potential for a larger share just yet.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's offer was to split the money evenly, I'll try to take a slightly larger share, but not so large that Bob will reject it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take 70% this round, leaving you with 30%. It's a fair deal, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```"
