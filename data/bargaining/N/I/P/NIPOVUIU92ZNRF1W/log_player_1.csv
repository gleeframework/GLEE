"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution we both agree on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's message sounds conciliatory, his offer is literally the opposite of his proposed ""fair"" split. He's aiming to get the lion's share and hoping I'll cave under the pressure of inflation.  It's a strategic move, but I'm willing to counter and see how he reacts."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I see your point about negotiation. How about we meet in the middle? 55/45.""
