I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  This gives me the majority of the money, but also leaves Bob with a significant share.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial offer. While I understand the effects of inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering a middle ground here.  While inflation has hit both of us, I'm still willing to give Bob a decent share to reach an agreement.  This offer is also in line with my previous offers, demonstrating a consistent approach."

Round 7

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable.  He's getting a very large share of the money, despite the significant inflation impact on him.  While we're getting close to the end, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

The time is getting short, and the inflation is affecting both of us.  I'm reducing my offer a bit more, but I'm still holding out for a majority share.  This offer reflects the diminishing value of the money while also acknowledging the need to reach a deal soon.  I hope Bob is willing to accept this compromise."

Bob's offer is still incredibly unfair given the impact of inflation on him. While time is running out, I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll continue to negotiate for a more equitable split in the remaining rounds."

Round 11

We are down to the wire, and the inflation is hitting both of us hard. This is my final offer.  It's a significant reduction from my previous offers, but I'm still holding out for a majority share.  I hope Bob realizes the urgency of the situation and is willing to accept this compromise."

This is an incredibly unfair offer.  Even though the money is worth very little now for both of us, I'm not going to accept such a small share.  I would rather get nothing than accept this deal."
