"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous in the first round, but you need to be reasonable if we want to both get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, I'm hoping to get a better deal later on.  The fact that the money depreciates for me at a higher rate than for Alice means I need to be more aggressive."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's split this fairly.  I'm offering you a good amount, but we both need to be flexible to make sure we get something.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be a fair split for both of us.  Let's work together to get a deal done before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
The money is depreciating quickly, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer.  It's time to take what I can get."
