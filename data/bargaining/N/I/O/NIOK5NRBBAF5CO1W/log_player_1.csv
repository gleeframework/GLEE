"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair deal, considering we both have to account for the decreasing value of money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his offer is actually a good one. I'll accept it.
