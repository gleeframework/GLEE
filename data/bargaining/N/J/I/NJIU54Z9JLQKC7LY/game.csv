550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but the split isn't quite equitable for me. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we try a 55/45 split?  It's a win-win before inflation cuts into our potential gains.",Bob,2,

580000.0,420000.0,"I see you're willing to negotiate, but I still think I can get a better deal. Considering the inflation is affecting your gain, I'm willing to make a small concession. Let's try 58-42, and we can wrap this up.",Alice,3,

540000.0,460000.0,"Alice, we need to settle this before inflation eats away at the value.  I'm proposing 54/46.  It's a fair deal considering the circumstances, and it lets us both walk away with a substantial sum.",Bob,4,

590000.0,410000.0,"I see you're getting anxious about the inflation, and rightly so. However, I'm not feeling the same pressure. I'll make a tiny concession, but I think I'm being generous considering the circumstances. Let's do 59-41, and we can call it a day.",Alice,5,
