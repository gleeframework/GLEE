"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we need to account for. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer, I think a 55-45 split is a bit too skewed towards Bob. I'd like to make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather not give up that much. Let's try 50-50.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and my money is worth 5% less again!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
