"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly and avoid inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you value a quick resolution, but my offer accounts for the decreasing value of the money over time.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. Accepting would have left me with significantly less.
* **My Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, recognizing that the money loses value with each round. My offer is still reasonable and encourages Alice to settle sooner rather than later.
* **The Message:**  I want to convey that I understand her desire to avoid inflation's impact. My offer reflects that concern while also seeking a fairer distribution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more balanced offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice acknowledges the inflation, her offer still heavily favors her.  The decreasing value of the money means we need to find a solution quickly, but not at the cost of a significantly uneven split. I'll try to incentivize her to settle in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out - this is my final offer to settle before the money loses significant value for both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the decreasing value of the money becomes a more significant factor. I need to incentivize Alice to settle quickly.
* **Final Offer:**  By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency. This might push Alice to accept a less favorable split than she'd ideally want, knowing that further delays will only hurt both of us.
* **Balanced Split:** While this offer still slightly favors me, it's more balanced than previous rounds. This shows a willingness to compromise, potentially making it more appealing to Alice."
