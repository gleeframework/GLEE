I propose taking $900,000 and giving Bob $100,000.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept that. It's a lot better for him than for me, and I know I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $150,000 and keep $850,000 for myself. I think this is a good compromise, and it still leaves me with a good chunk of the money."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to take what I can get, I'm still in a better position than I was in Round 2.  I'll reject and hope I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $750,000 for myself and $250,000 for Bob. Inflation is biting, but I'm hoping this is enough to sway him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting very close to my bottom line, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll reject this and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm cutting my gains to $650,000 and offering Bob $350,000. We're getting very close to the end of the game and inflation is really hitting us now, so I need to make a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, inflation has eroded my potential gains so much that I'm willing to accept this offer, even though it's significantly less than what I initially wanted."
