"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more equitable this time. How about a 55/45 split? It's still a good deal for you, considering the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
