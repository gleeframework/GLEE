Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly again. Inflation is hitting both of us now, so it's the best way to ensure we both get something reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is steadily eroding the value of Alice's potential gains. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for her.
* **Bob's Position:**  Bob seems insistent on getting at least half.  He rejected Alice's more generous offers, indicating he understands the inflation dynamic is in his favor.
* **Minimizing Losses:** Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal now is better than risking an even worse outcome in later rounds."
