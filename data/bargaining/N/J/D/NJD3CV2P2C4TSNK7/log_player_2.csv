# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It accounts for inflation and is still a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the inflation, this deal is relatively better for me compared to the previous offers, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next rounds."
