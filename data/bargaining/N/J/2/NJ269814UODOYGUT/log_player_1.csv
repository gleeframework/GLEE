"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. I'll take 80, you can have 20.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this time, let's try to find a compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is worth less than my gain of $80 in the first round.

I'll think for a moment...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of $50 is worth even less now, so I'll aim for a higher share this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you can have 40. Let's compromise and move forward.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to give you a smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. With a 14.26% reduction, my gain of $35 is equivalent to about $30 in the first round.

Considering the previous offers, I'm not thrilled about giving up a larger share, but I don't want to risk waiting for an even worse offer.
