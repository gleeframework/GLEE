"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share to encourage him to accept, but I want to secure a fair amount for myself. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While he's offering me more than the previous round, it's still significantly less than what I initially proposed, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, and the money is losing value each round, I think this is a fair and reasonable compromise."
