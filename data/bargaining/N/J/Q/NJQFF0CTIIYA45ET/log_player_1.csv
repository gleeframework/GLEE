"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to give myself 60% of the money and Bob 40%. This is a pretty standard starting offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I need to be more aggressive in my counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think Bob's offer is generous enough, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for another round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 40% less for me now (20% less than the previous round), I need to be even more aggressive. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it given the decreasing value of the money."
