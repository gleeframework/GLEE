"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even though the value of my share has decreased, it's still a better offer than my previous attempt. Accepting ensures I get something, and I don't want to risk further inflation."
