"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the wisdom in accepting my proposal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your previous offer was too low, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can meet me in the middle, huh? I'm not so sure...

I'll reject his offer for now. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, but not quite!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm still hoping he'll accept and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take a closer look at Bob's offer. With the inflation, his offer is actually a bit more generous than it seems at first glance.

I'll accept his offer this time.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
