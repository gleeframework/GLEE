Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are too severe. Accepting Alice's offer, while far from ideal, is the only way to salvage anything substantial from this negotiation.  The longer the game goes on, the less I'll have, even if I could eventually get Alice to agree to a slightly better split."
