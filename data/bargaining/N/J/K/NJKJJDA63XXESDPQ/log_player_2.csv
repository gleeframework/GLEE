"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a small share, but it's better than nothing! Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While getting $1000 is something, I'm confident I can do better than that in the next 11 rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""This is a fair split, I believe.  Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm taking into account the inflation, and I think this is a fair split.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, this offer is fair considering the inflation and the fact that I'm likely to get nothing if we keep rejecting each other's proposals."
