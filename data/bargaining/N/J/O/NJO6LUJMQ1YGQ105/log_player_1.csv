"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. You can do better next round, I'm sure!""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate and potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split since we're losing value with each round. This ensures we both get an equal share before inflation takes effect. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move from Bob!

Considering the inflation rates, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, a 50/50 split might not be as advantageous as it seems.

However, I'll consider the fact that we're losing value with each round, and this offer ensures we both get a fair share before things get worse. I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's take the 50/50 split and hope for a better deal in the next round!"
