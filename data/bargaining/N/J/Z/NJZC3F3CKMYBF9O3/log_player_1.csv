"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than the original $10,000, so I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain by $200, while still giving Bob a larger share. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better offer, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the effects of inflation, my gain is now worth 14.26% less than the original $10,000, which means I'm getting less and less of the actual value of the money.

Bob's offer is a bit better than his previous one, but I'm still not convinced I'm getting a fair deal.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more after your previous offers""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
