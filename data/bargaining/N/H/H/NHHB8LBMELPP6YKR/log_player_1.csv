"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping the remaining $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round, the offer from Bob in Round 2 is equivalent to:

Alice gain: $4,000 (20% of $20,000)
Bob gain: $4,000 (20% of $20,000)

I'll accept Bob's offer.
