"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, so he might be motivated to accept and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round where the money will be worth even less.

I accept Bob's offer.
