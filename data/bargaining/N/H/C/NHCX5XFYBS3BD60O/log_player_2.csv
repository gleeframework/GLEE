Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This time, I'm willing to go down to a 55/45 split.  Let's get this done before things get even worse! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

``` 

Although not ideal, accepting this offer ensures Bob receives something.  The longer the game goes on, the more value is lost due to inflation, putting Bob at a significant disadvantage."
