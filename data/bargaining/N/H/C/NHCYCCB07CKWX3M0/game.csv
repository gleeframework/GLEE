8000.0,2000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. I believe this offers a fair distribution considering the risk and potential for inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the risk of inflation while still offering you a fair share. Let's reach a resolution before the money loses further value.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
