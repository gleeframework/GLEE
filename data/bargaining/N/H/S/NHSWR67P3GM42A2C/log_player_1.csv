"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000, which is a 60-40 split. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more even split.  Let's be reasonable and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth 90% of the original $600,000, which is $540,000. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 95% of the original $400,000, which is $530,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about this split, Bob. I'd like to propose an alternative.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A 50-50 split seems fair considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
