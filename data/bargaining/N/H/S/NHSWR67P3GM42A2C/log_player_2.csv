It's a good start, but Alice is taking a larger share.  I'll see what I can do in the next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A 50-50 split seems fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a fair split, and inflation is a major concern now.  Let's finalize this."
