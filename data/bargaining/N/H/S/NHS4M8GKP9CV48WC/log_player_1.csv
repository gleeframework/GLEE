  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I've attached a message suggesting that this is a fair split, in the hopes that Bob will accept and we can end the game early. Let me know what Bob decides!"

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""
}
```

I've taken into account the previous offers and tried to find a middle ground. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer before the value of the money decreases further."
