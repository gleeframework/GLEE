"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be a bit more realistic this time. This offer is better for me, but still leaves you with a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
