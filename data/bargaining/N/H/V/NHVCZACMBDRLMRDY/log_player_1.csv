"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the total amount, and keeping 600,000 dollars for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it down the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get a larger share now to compensate for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer is a fair one, and I don't want to risk going lower in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
