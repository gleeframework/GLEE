"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous. This is my final offer, so don't risk losing out on anything. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective gain as 40% of the original amount. In this case, I'd be getting $20 (40% of $50).

However, Bob's gain is still worth the full $51. I'm not sure if I should take this offer, but I'll consider it...

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you the majority, but I want to make sure I get something substantial.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, giving Bob the majority, but keeping some value for myself."
