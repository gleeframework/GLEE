**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation hitting her harder, but this offer is still not favorable to me. I need to hold firm to get a better deal in the coming rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is the most fair offer considering the inflation.  We both lose if this goes on any longer.""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming a significant factor. While I want more, a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this stage to ensure we both get a reasonable amount."
