"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in Round 1. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```
I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money continuing to lose value, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is very close to the original 50/50 split, and the money is worth significantly less than it was at the start, I'll consider accepting this offer.
