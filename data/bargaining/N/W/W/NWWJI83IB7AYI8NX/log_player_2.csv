"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll take the risk of inflation for now and hope to get a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm offering you 4500, which is still a good deal for you, and leaves 5500 for me. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I'll take 5500, and leave you with 4500. This way, we both get a slightly better deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is better than what I would get if we continue and the inflation continues to eat away at our potential gains. It's time to secure a decent deal."
