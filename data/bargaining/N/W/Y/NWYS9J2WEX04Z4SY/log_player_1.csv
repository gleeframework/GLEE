I'm sticking with my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob realizes that rejecting my offer twice will ultimately lead to him getting less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob has shown he's willing to play hardball.  The inflation is taking a toll, and continuing to reject offers could mean getting nothing at all. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, even though it's significantly less than my initial goal."
