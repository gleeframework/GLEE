Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm taking a different approach. You can have the smaller share this time, but remember, the money is worth less with each passing round. Let's work out a deal that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
