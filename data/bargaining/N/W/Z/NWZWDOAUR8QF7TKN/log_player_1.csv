Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, 55-45 is still fair 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, 52-48 is a good deal considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate and the inflation is significantly impacting his potential gains. I'm sticking to my strategy of aiming higher, as I believe he will be forced to accept a less favorable deal in the later rounds."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 70,

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, 50-50 is the fairest deal we can get at this point 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting a 50-50 split at this stage is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing significantly. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I could negotiate a slightly better deal in the next couple of rounds, the difference wouldn't be substantial enough to outweigh the risk of losing everything.
* **Bob's Desperation:** Bob offering a 50-50 split indicates a level of desperation. He's likely realized the inflation is working against him and wants to secure *something* rather than nothing. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes a guaranteed win, even if smaller than initially hoped, is the best outcome in a negotiation with dwindling time and increasing risk."
