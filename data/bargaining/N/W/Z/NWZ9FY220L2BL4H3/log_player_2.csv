Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, are you serious? This is getting ridiculous! I'm offering you a very generous amount, considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation on my end. Take it before we both lose out! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is getting desperate.  We're past the halfway point, and her offers are getting worse for her.  Holding firm is in Bob's best interest right now."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{

""message"": ""Alice, it seems you're starting to panic. Don't worry, I'm offering you a lifeline. Take this deal, and we can both avoid a total loss.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Apply Pressure:** Alice is clearly feeling the heat of inflation. This round Bob increases the pressure with a slightly more aggressive offer. 
* **Exploit Desperation:**  Her messages indicate increasing desperation.  Bob needs to leverage this to his advantage.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With fewer rounds remaining, Bob needs to secure a deal soon while still aiming for a favorable outcome."

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is insane! Inflation is eating away at this deal, and you're stuck on getting a bigger share. Let's be realistic and end this. This is my final offer! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Power Dynamics:** Alice is now using stronger language, indicating a ""final offer."" This suggests she may be reaching her breaking point and could make even worse offers in the next rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal is becoming increasingly risky. While Bob could potentially get more in later rounds, there's also a chance Alice's offers will become unacceptable, leaving him with nothing.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds remaining, the pressure is on.  Delaying further significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing. 

This offer gives Bob a reasonable share of the money.  While not ideal, it's better to accept a decent offer now than risk getting nothing later."
