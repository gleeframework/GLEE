Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be fair and split the difference, accounting for the devaluation. This offer ensures we both benefit from a quick agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
