**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently offering less than half, hoping I'll panic as inflation eats into the value. However, his offers are getting slightly better.  I need to hold firm and signal I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to secure a better deal.  There's still time, but I need to start aiming for an agreement soon."
