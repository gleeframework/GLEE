"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a big share, but I'm leaving Bob with something to incentivize him to accept.  It's a risky move, but with the inflation in play, it's better to get as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to accept this offer. My share is much less than in the first round, but I'll get nothing if I reject and Bob's offer gets rejected again. The next round will leave me with a much smaller share."
