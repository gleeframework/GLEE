Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a division of 450,000 for me and 550,000 for you. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the decrease in value of money. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000
