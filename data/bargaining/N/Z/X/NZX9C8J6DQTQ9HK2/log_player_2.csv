Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 80/20. This is a fair offer given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's try this again. 60/40 split.  It's a better deal than your last one, and time is ticking away for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to the end. I'm willing to meet you halfway at 70/30.  It's the best offer I can make before the inflation really hits. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her offer, but it's still far from an even split. With the inflation working against me, I need to hold out for a better deal. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than Alice to avoid getting nothing in the end, but 70/30 is too far off."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and the inflation is eating away at my share.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a compromise, and it gets us both a decent amount before the value drops even further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting nervous now. We need to agree soon.  I'm proposing 65/35. It's a fair deal with the inflation, and I'm not sure how much more I can give. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing signs of getting nervous, which means my strategy of holding out might be working. While 65/35 is better than her previous offers, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. With only a few rounds left, I need to push for a more significant concession from her."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's end this now with a clean, fair 50/50 split.  It's the only sensible option with the time constraint and the shrinking pot.""}"
