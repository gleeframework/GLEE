"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you take 30.""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, considering we both have to agree.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to be cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer."
