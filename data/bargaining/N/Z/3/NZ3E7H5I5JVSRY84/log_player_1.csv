"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me this round, I'll consider the actual values:

My gain would be 4000 * 0.95 = 3800
Bob's gain would be 6000

I'm not comfortable with this offer, as I'd be giving up a significant amount. I'll reject it and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round, but I still want to keep some balance.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly larger share than he proposed in round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit more aggressive, but still willing to compromise. Your turn to respond. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me this round, I'll consider the actual values:

My gain would be 3500 * 0.8584 = 3007.4
Bob's gain would be 6500

I'm not comfortable with this offer, as I'd be giving up a significant amount. I'll reject it and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a balance between our interests. Let's meet in the middle this round.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to try to find a more acceptable middle ground for both of us."
