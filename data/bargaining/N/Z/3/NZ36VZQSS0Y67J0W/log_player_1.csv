"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering the reduced values, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: $2,500
* Bob's gain: $6,750 (but actually $6,750 x 0.9 = $6,075 due to the 10% reduction for Bob)

I'll reject this offer. My gain is too low, and I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my proposed gain is:

$2,500 / 0.8 = $3,125

I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3125,
  ""bob_gain"": 6875,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's move forward!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take the low offer! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: $2,000 / 0.848 = $2,356 (due to the 20% reduction in the first round, then 20% reduction again in the second round, and another 20% reduction in the third round, and finally 20% reduction in the fourth round)
* Bob's gain: $8,000 / 0.727 = $11,030 (but actually $11,030 x 0.9 = $9,927 due to the 10% reduction for Bob)

I'll reject this offer. My gain is too low, and I think I can do better.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation.

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my proposed gain is:

$2,500 / 0.528 = $4,726

I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4726,
  ""bob_gain"": 5274,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a sweet spot, before it's too late!""
}
