"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the effective amounts are:

Alice gain: 7,000 * 0.95 = 6,650
Bob gain: 3,000 * 0.8 = 2,400

I'll accept this offer.
