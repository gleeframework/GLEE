"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I'll aim to get a better deal. Let's see what I can propose in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's adjust the split to account for inflation. This way, we both get a decent share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the remaining money evenly.  Inflation is a factor for both of us, so this seems like the fairest solution. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 19% less for me now, the actual value of the $5000 is approximately $4050. Considering this, I'll make a decision based on the adjusted value.
