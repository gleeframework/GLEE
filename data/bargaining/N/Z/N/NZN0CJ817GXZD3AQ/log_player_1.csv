"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 7 to 3, it's a good start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$, which is a generous 30% of the initial amount, and I'll take the remaining 700,000$. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both have to agree on this. Let's work towards a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less now, so I need to adjust my expectations.

After reviewing Bob's offer, I think a 55/45 split is indeed more favorable to me than the previous 70/30 split. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like a bit more. Can we discuss further?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$, which is a 40% share, and I'll take the remaining 600,000$. The message is an invitation to continue negotiating and see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution."
