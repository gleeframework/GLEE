"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both receive $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I'm being taken advantage of. I was willing to split it 50/50, and now Bob is trying to take 60% of the total amount. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, but I'll give you a bit more. Don't get too comfortable!""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a balance."
