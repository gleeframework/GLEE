Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'm hoping we can find a more equitable split in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's best to see if a more balanced split is possible in the future rounds.  Rejection allows me to make a proposal next round and potentially get a better deal."
