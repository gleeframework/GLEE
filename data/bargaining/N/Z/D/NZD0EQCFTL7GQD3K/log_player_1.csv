{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000. This is a good starting point, and I think it's a fair way to begin the game."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to make a more aggressive decision.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer, taking a slightly smaller share myself to try to get a better deal. Let's see if Bob bites!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal this time, Alice! I'm taking a slightly smaller share to make it more interesting 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is really losing value fast!

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think about it. Since Bob is taking a slightly smaller share, I might as well try to squeeze a bit more out of him.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway and split it evenly again, but this time with a bit more urgency""}

I'm trying to get back to the 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me halfway. The money is losing value so fast, I don't want to wait too long to make a deal!"
