"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but let's be reasonable.  This is a fair starting point, and if you reject it, the value of the money will go down for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
