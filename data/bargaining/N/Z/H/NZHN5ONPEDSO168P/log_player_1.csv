"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair start, and we can adjust if needed. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the new amounts are:

Alice gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500
Bob gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
