# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 55 for me and 45 for you.  We're both getting closer to what we want.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
I'll keep pushing for a better deal. The inflation is hurting my gains, but I think I can get more than 45. Let's see what happens next round!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is eating away at my share, so I'll take a bigger cut. 58 for me, and we can call it a day?""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're going back and forth, but I'm not budging on 60. That's my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""} 
I've been hit hard by inflation, and Alice is not willing to budge. At this point, accepting 40 is the best option for me, even though it's worth significantly less than it was in the first round."
