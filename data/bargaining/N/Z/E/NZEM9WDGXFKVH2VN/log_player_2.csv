Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'll take 90% and leave you with 10%, it's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation! ðŸ˜‰""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a better deal, but still keep some for myself 
# Bob gain: 700000 
# Alice gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's see how much Alice can actually gain with the 19% discount. 700,000 is better than my previous offer. I'll take it."
