"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that I get $9000 and Bob gets $1000. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm taking the majority because I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is making it less worthwhile to keep rejecting offers. This is a reasonable split, and the next round would likely see me get even less due to inflation."
