```

I'm taking a major risk here, but I'm offering a significant share to Bob. I'm hoping that the high inflation rate and the fact that we're nearing the end of the game will convince him to finally accept. If he doesn't, we're both going to lose a lot of money."

This is absurd! Bob is clearly being unreasonable and is trying to take advantage of the situation.  I'm not accepting this pitiful offer. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round, even though the inflation is taking a huge toll on the value of the money."
