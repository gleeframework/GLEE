"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

{""bob_gain"": 2500, ""alice_gain"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the new inflation rates, I'll evaluate Alice's offer. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me and 36% less for Alice, I'll compare the values to the original proposal. 

My gain is now worth 9.75% less than 2000, which is approximately 1800. 
Alice's gain is now worth 36% less than 8000, which is approximately 5120.

Alice's offer is a good compromise, so I'll accept it.
