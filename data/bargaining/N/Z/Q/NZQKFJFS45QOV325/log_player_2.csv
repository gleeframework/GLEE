Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate. However, Alice's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a good compromise considering the decreased value of the money.
