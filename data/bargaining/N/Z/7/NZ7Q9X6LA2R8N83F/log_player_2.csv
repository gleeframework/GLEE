Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily getting less and less due to inflation, yet her offers are not reflecting this urgency. While she's ""compromising"", it's not enough to be in Bob's best interest. Bob should hold out for a better deal, aiming for at least a 60/40 split in his favor."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share, but not too small. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the shrinking value, but she's still not offering a deal that reflects the urgency of the situation. Bob is in a strong position and can afford to wait for a better offer.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to aim for a more favorable split."
