"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40% upfront. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have nothing to lose by waiting. Meanwhile, Alice has an incentive to offer me more in the next round because the money loses value for her. So, I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make an offer that is slightly more favorable to me than Alice's previous offer, but still reasonable enough for Alice to consider, given that the money loses value for her with each passing round.

{""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair adjustment.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, accepting your offer would mean I lose even more value due to inflation in the next round. I'm sticking with my initial offer - it's fair and straightforward. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI previously rejected this exact offer in Round 1, and since then, the dynamics of the game haven't changed in a way that would make this offer more appealing to me. The money still doesn't lose value for me, and Alice is now facing a greater incentive to compromise due to the increasing impact of inflation on her potential gain. Given this, I have no reason to accept an offer that I previously found unsatisfactory.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's Alice's turn again. She needs to consider the effect of inflation and make a more attractive offer if she wants to reach an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the increasing pressure of inflation on Alice's potential gain, I'll make an offer that is slightly more favorable to me than my previous one. Since Alice is now more incentivized to reach an agreement due to the devaluing of her potential gain, I believe she'll be more likely to accept a slightly less favorable offer.

{""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Considering the growing impact of inflation on your gain, I think this offer is reasonable.""}"
