I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share.  I'll see if he's willing to accept a quick deal."

Round 7

Round 9

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. We are both losing money due to inflation, and it's getting very risky to continue with this game.  It's time to be reasonable and find a compromise."
