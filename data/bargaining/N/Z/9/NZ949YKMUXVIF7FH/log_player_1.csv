I propose a 900,000:100,000 split in my favor. This gives you a decent starting point and leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 600,000:400,000 split.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need a larger share to make up for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm getting a significantly smaller share than I initially wanted,  it's better than nothing at this point. The inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, and I'm unsure if I can get a better deal in the next round."
