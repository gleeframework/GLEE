"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money and Bob 10%. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point, and Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is too far in his favor. I'm confident that we can reach a more equitable agreement in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm willing to compromise and offer Bob a larger share, but I still need to secure a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is better than in the previous round, it's still not a fair split. The inflation is becoming a serious concern, but I'm willing to continue negotiating for a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  Inflation is making the stakes higher, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger portion.  However, I still believe a 60/40 split is fair, considering that we are both losing a significant amount of money each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is closer to what I was hoping for, it's still not a fair split.  I'm hoping that we can reach a more equitable agreement in the next round.  The inflation is reaching a critical point, and I am running out of time, but I believe we can still find a mutually acceptable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split. With inflation getting worse, I need to secure a bigger portion of the money, but I'm still willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  I believe this offer is fair, considering the time pressure and the value of the money decreasing with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is becoming too severe, and I need to secure some money before it's too late.  While I would have preferred a slightly larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise, especially given the rapid decrease in the value of the money.  I accept this offer."
