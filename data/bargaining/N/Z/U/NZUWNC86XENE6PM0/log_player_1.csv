"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a significant portion. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less after inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't like the terms of Bob's offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'm still getting a larger share, but giving Bob a slightly larger share than before to try to get him to accept."
