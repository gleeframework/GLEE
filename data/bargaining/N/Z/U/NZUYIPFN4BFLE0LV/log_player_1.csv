"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. This gives Bob a small share to consider, but I believe it's a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a more equitable split, the inflation factor is significant. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least some money, whereas rejecting it could lead to a situation where I get nothing in the next round."
