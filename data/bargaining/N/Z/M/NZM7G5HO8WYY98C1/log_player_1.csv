"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm taking advantage of the inflation factor and assuming Bob doesn't know about it.  I'll see if he bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I'm getting significantly less than what I proposed, accepting this offer is still better than continuing.  I'd be getting 100,000 now, which is worth more than the 900,000 I would have gotten in the first round, but would have been worth 90,000 in round 3 if I kept rejecting.  It's worth it to cut my losses at this point."
