I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given I am the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I propose a 50/50 split. Given the inflation, I think this is a fair and reasonable offer, and it ensures we both get a decent amount."
