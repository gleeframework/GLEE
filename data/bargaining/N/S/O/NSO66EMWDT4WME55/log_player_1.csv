"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing to take 60% of the initial 100$ and leave 40% for Bob. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're just starting the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split. Let's start with that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's revised offer is a good one. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I think I should get a bit more than 40%. On the other hand, Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he's not getting as much as he initially wanted. I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll try to make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation. I'll aim for a slightly better split for myself, considering the reduced value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll compromise at 55/45. It's a fairer split considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing to take 55% of the remaining 100$, leaving 45% for Bob. I hope this revised offer will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, 50/50, and avoid further complications with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the idea of splitting it evenly, as I think I can still do better considering the inflation. However, Bob's offer is a relatively stable and straightforward proposal, and it's getting late in the game. I'll have to weigh the risks of rejecting this offer and potentially getting nothing.
