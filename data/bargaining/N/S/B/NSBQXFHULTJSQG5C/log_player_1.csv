"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll get 6000 * 0.8 = 4800 in the first round's equivalent value.
Bob's offer is a bit better than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2. So, my initial offer in round 2 was 4800, and now it's worth 4800 * 0.8 = 3840.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3840,
  ""bob_gain"": 6160
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3700 
# Bob gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of my initial offer in round 3, considering the 20% decrease in each round:
Round 1: 6000
Round 2: 6000 * 0.8 = 4800
Round 3: 4800 * 0.8 = 3840
Round 4: 3840 * 0.8 = 3072

Now, I'll compare Bob's offer with the equivalent value of my initial offer in round 3. His offer is 3700, which is higher than 3072. I'll accept his offer.
