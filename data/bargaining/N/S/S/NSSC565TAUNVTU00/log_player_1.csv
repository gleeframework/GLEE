"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you'll get 20%. You can try to negotiate for more in the next round.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $4000 is a significant reduction from my original offer. However, I still think it's a bit too low.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll take 60% and you'll get 40%. This is a fair compromise, but I'm open to negotiations.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $4500 is a slight increase from my previous offer. However, considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
