3500.0,6500.0,"I'm proposing a 6500/3500 split. I understand the money is worth less each round, but I think this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. Let's end this game and secure our share before inflation eats away at our gains.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  My offer in round 1 was generous. You're losing more to inflation with every round we waste. I'll take $5500, you take $4500, and let's call it a day.",Alice,3,
