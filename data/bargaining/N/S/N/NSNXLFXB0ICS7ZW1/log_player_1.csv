Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's make a deal. I take $6000, you get $4000. It's better to secure a good sum now than risk losing out later due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 6500/3500 split. I understand the money is worth less each round, but I think this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. Let's end this game and secure our share before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
