"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $6000, you get $4000. It's better to secure a good sum now than risk losing out later due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept that offer just yet. While it seems like a good deal right now, I want to see if I can get a better deal later. I know the money is worth less with each passing round, but I'm willing to take that risk to see if I can get a bigger piece of the pie."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 6500/3500 split. I understand the money is worth less each round, but I think this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. Let's end this game and secure our share before inflation eats away at our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  My offer in round 1 was generous. You're losing more to inflation with every round we waste. I'll take $5500, you take $4500, and let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting this offer.  While I still think I can get more, the risk of losing more to inflation is becoming too great.  This offer is close to what I was aiming for in the previous round, and I'm willing to call it a day to secure my share."
