  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This way, we both get a decent share of the initial amount."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

```

}
```

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This way, we're closer to a fair split, taking into account the reduced value of money."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Considering the reduced value of money, I think I can do better than this. I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a better deal. I'd like to make a new offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think I'm getting close to my limit. Let's see if you'll meet me here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $3,800 and Bob gets $6,200. This is a relatively small share for me, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finalize the deal."
