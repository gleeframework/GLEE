"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, considering the next round will be worth less""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The deal's getting worse for both of us with each round, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the value of the money decreases by 20% each round, in Round 3, the money is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80% is 64%). If we continue to Round 4, the money will be worth 51.2% of its original value (80% of 64% is 51.2%).\n\nConsidering this, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the best decision. Although the offer is not ideal, the decreasing value of the money means that any future offers will be worth less in real terms. Therefore, accepting the offer now guarantees a gain of $450,000, which is worth more than any potential gain in future rounds.\n\n###\n\nThe final answer is {""decision"": ""accept""}."
