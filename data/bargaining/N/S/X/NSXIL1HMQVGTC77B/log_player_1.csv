"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! You'll get $100,000 now, and I'll get the rest. Don't make me wait!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting it all, Alice! Take this and let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's got the upper hand now. But I'm not convinced!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me $400,000, considering the money I could get in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make another offer!

Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to balance it out a bit. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's split it 55/45 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount. Will he accept?"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a little too greedy, Alice. This is a fair offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer! The money he's offering me is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

However, I'm still not convinced that this is the best offer I can get. I'll reject it and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm holding out for a better offer, hoping that Bob will be willing to give me a more favorable split as the rounds go on."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob! 48/52 is a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still a decent amount for myself. Will he accept this time?"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'm not going to let you walk all over me. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer now! The money he's offering me is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out. I'll need to decide whether to accept this offer or risk waiting for a better one.

After considering the options, I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm taking the $200,000, and we can finally end the game!"
