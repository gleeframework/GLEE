I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared for him to reject it and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a more even split, I'm confident that I can get a better deal for myself in the next round. I still have a strong negotiating position, and I'm willing to risk going another round to secure a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a 7000/3000 split.  I'm taking into account Bob's rejection of my previous offer, but I still believe I can get a majority share.  I'm aiming for a compromise that balances my desire for a larger share with the risk of further rounds and potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to become a significant factor.  This offer provides a decent amount of money for me, and the risk of continuing and potentially getting nothing at all is too high. I'm willing to compromise and secure a win now."
