"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, but I'm willing to be generous 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $2850.

I'm not thrilled with the 75-25 split, but I'm willing to accept this offer to get some money out of the game. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
