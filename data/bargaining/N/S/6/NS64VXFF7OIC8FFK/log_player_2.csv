Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While my potential gains are decreasing at a faster rate, accepting a 40/60 split at this stage would be significantly worse than holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds."
