"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 70/30. It's a good deal for you in the first round, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems generous in the first round, it's important to consider the inflation. By rejecting, I can make a counter-offer and potentially get a better deal for myself, especially since the money will be worth less for Alice in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 40% in this round, but let's be fair - we both need to get the most out of this before the inflation hits hard!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be serious. I'll take a slight hit with 60/40, but the clock is ticking for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is a good compromise considering the inflation. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money before it becomes worthless."
