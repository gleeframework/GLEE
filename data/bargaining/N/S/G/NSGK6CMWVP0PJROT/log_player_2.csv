Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're losing money with every round. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nA 50/50 split seems fair at this point, especially considering the significant loss of value due to inflation. It's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation."
