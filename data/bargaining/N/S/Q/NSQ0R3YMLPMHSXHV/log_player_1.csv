"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a 90/10 split, giving myself $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent amount to consider while still securing the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share, especially considering the inflation will only hurt Bob more in future rounds. I believe I can still get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm offering Bob $150,000 and keeping $850,000 for myself. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still maintains a significant share for me. I believe this offer is fair considering the inflation and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting more favorable to him, it's still not a good enough deal for me. I'm not willing to accept a share that's below 75% of the total at this point, considering the inflation is hurting Bob more than it is hurting me.  I believe I can still get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is another compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still hoping to get a fair deal without having to accept a drastically lower percentage. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, but I believe I can still get a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is becoming more favorable to him, it's still not a good enough deal for me. I'm not willing to accept a share that's below 70% of the total at this point, especially considering the inflation is hurting Bob much more than it is hurting me. I believe I can still get a better offer, even with the limited time remaining."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. This is my final compromise.  I'm willing to give up a bit more to reach a deal, but I'm not willing to accept a lower share than this. The inflation is starting to take its toll on both of us, and I think we need to find a solution before it gets any worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though this isn't ideal, with only a few rounds remaining, the inflation will drastically reduce Bob's share while my share will stay the same. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least $500,000, which is a better outcome than risking getting nothing."
