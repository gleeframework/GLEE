I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I figure Bob might be willing to accept a smaller share to get something right away.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy! He's basically trying to take almost everything.  I'm not going to accept that, even with the inflation, and I'll counter with a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is still a significant offer, and it's closer to a fair division than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping that by showing willingness to compromise, I can reach an agreement before the inflation gets too out of control."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hurting me, Bob's offer is still pretty bad. He's just trying to get a better deal for himself by taking advantage of the inflation. I'm going to continue to push for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to a 55/45 split in my favor. I'm still willing to compromise, but I'm also aware that time is running out, and I need to ensure I get a decent share. This offer is still more fair than Bob's last one, and I'm hoping he sees reason and accepts it."
