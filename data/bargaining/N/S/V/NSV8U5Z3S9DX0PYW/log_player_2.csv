Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a similar split, but slightly more in my favor.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy. Alice's offer is still a 50.55/49.45 split, which is a slight improvement from her previous offer. However, I'm not sure if I should take it, given the reduced value of money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to increase my chances of getting a better deal. I'll aim for a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor.
