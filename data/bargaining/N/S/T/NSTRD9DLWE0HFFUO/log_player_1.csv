"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, 70/30.  Accept this and we both get something decent. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is not as generous as I would have liked, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""This is my revised offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $510,000 and keeping $490,000 for myself."
