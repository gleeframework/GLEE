Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic ultimatum game. I'm taking nearly everything, but I'm giving Bob $1 to make it seem like there's a chance of getting something. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, hoping that Bob will accept to avoid getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much better offer for me than what I proposed in the first round. Although I'm getting less than I initially wanted, taking a 50/50 split is better than getting nothing in the next round.  Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, the risk of getting nothing is too high."
