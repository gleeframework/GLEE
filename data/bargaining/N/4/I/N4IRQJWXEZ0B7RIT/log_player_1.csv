"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see where we go from here.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can see how the negotiations go from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal later on. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an interesting starting point. I'd rather not give up such a large share of the money right off the bat. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too uneven. I'd like to propose a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, and I'd like to propose something more equitable in the next round."

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in return for my larger share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount of money. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much control.

Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still quite uneven, and I'd like to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too skewed towards your favor. I'd like to propose a more balanced split.""
}
```

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping we can find a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount of money. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me halfway, but still wants a slightly larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you a 60/40 split. I think we can do better than that.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, and I'd like to propose something that's closer to a 50/50 split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""message"": ""Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think we can find a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit closer to a 50/50 split than my previous offers, but still gives me a slight edge. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a small concession. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to keep the majority of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still not acceptable. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, and I'd like to propose something that's more in my favor. I'm starting to think that Bob is being a bit too greedy, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's go back to a 50/50 split. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal.""
}
```

I'm going back to my original proposal from round 1, which was a 50/50 split. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it."
