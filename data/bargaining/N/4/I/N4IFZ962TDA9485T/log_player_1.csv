"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose that I receive $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000.  Since it is the first round, I'm taking a risk and giving Bob a small share, hoping he will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Although I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation, it's better to take the $1,000 now than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
