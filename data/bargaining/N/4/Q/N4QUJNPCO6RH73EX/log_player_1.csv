"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my $500,000 is now worth 80% of the original value, which is $400,000. This is a decent offer, but I'd like to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value now, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping he'll accept."
