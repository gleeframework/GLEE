Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the inflation eats into her potential gains.  While her offer isn't terrible, I'm still in a strong position to hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time to be fair.  An even split, let's end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point.  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, but I need to make sure we reach a deal.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering a 50/50 split makes me appear fair and willing to compromise, which might push Alice to accept.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to push for a higher amount gets riskier with each round.  Settling for an even split guarantees a reasonable outcome."
