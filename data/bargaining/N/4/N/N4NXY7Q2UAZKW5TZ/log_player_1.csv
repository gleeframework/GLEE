This is a fair and equal division, and it's a good starting point for the game.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better for him, it's still significantly worse for me than the initial 50/50 split. I'm going to reject it and hope for a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a slight increase to my share.  While it's still less than the initial 50/50 split,  I'm hoping this is a compromise that Bob will accept, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable for me, and the inflation is really hurting my potential earnings.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  I'm willing to take a slight decrease in my share to avoid further inflation and secure a deal. This is also the offer he made in round 2, and it's likely the closest we can get to a compromise given our current situation."
