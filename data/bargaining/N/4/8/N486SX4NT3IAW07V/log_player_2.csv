"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of my gain, considering the risk and uncertainty of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems reasonable, the risk of inflation is too high.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round, potentially securing a larger share before the money loses more value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
