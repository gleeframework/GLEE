"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, I'm willing to give you a good deal. Accept and we can shake hands.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more generous to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather not give up as much as 40% of the total amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation from the previous rounds.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to keep a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no more games 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive with his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk going to another round and losing even more value due to inflation."
