"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm hoping you'll be generous too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, which is a bigger hit. I'll have to be strategic.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30 in favor of me, I'll try to counter with a slightly more aggressive offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I'm still willing to be generous!""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I think I deserve a bit more this time! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger hit this round, my gain is worth significantly less. Bob's gain is also worth much less than before. I'll have to be careful not to give away too much.

I'll reject Bob's offer again, as it's still not in my favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate increasing, I need to be even more cautious. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, but still leave some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger and bigger toll on my potential gain. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, considering the significant hit from inflation, I think I should accept this offer. 85% of the remaining value is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in future rounds.
