"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 30 dollars, and I'll get 70 dollars. You can do better than that, can't you?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. Will you take it? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Bob's offer is 60-40, which is a more favorable split for me than my original proposal. However, considering the inflation, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough. I'll take 55 dollars, and you can have 45 dollars. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal this time, while still being reasonable considering the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle. No more negotiations, let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm not sure if 50-50 is the best I can get. However, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to meet me in the middle, which implies that he's not trying to take advantage of the inflation.

I'll take a chance and accept the offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
