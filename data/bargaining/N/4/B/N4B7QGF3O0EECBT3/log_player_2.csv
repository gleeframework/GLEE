Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the declining value, let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
Alice is trying to take advantage of the faster rate of inflation for her. It's still early in the game, so holding out for a better offer makes sense.
