"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer because I'm still losing 20% of my potential gain due to inflation, and I think I should get a bit more considering the initial proposal I made. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55 is a fairer split considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your proposal, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer because it's getting close to my previous proposal, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation. 50/50 seems like a fair split, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid further losses."
