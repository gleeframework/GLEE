Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 99/1 split in my favor. While it's a significant imbalance, it's the best way to maximize my gains in the first round, considering the risk of inflation. I'll need to see Bob's response to know how the game will progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, accepting this offer in Round 2 guarantees me a significant amount of money.  The risk of continued inflation and potentially receiving nothing is too high to gamble with."
