"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself $9,000 and Bob $1,000.  I'm starting with a generous offer, but I want to see if he'll accept or try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My gains are worth 10% less, meaning I'm effectively getting $6,000 * 0.9 = $5,400.
* **Potential Loss:** If I reject and get to make an offer in the next round, the value of my gains will decrease again by 10%. 
* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is a significant decrease from my initial proposal,  it's still a reasonable amount considering the inflation factor.

By accepting, I secure $5,400. Rejecting risks ending up with less."
