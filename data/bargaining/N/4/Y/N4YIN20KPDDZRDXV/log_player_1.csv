"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. However, I still want to get a decent amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but I'm not greedy""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increasing inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. I'll accept this offer.
