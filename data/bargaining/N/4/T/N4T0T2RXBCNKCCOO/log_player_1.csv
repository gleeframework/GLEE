"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is 25% of the total amount, and I'll take the remaining $750,000. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly biased split, but still a decent offer. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'll be getting $600,000 in today's value.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a split that heavily favors Bob, especially considering the inflation effect. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm taking a smaller share to account for the inflation effect, but I'm still trying to negotiate a decent split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more considering the original offer. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 51.2% of its original value, so I'll be getting $512,000 in today's value.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a split that gives me such a small share, considering the original offer was already biased towards Bob. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, Bob. This is my best offer so far. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm taking a smaller share to try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
