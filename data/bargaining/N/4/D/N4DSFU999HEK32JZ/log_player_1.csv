# Bob's message: That's not fair Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Take it or leave it.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking and we both lose if this fails. 55/45 is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer isn't ideal, with each passing round, the money loses value faster for me than Bob. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's better than risking getting nothing."
