"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. My previous offer was way too low. This offer is much fairer and still leaves you with a significant portion. Let's avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
