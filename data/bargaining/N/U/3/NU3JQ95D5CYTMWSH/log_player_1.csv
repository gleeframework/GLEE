"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $380,000 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer.
