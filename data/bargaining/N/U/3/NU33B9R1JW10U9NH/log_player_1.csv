"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount to keep him interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the money is worth 40% less now, I'll aim for a higher share to make up for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is dropping rapidly! Given the significant decrease in value, I'll try to get as much as I can while still leaving Bob with a decent amount. I'll accept this offer.
