# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. Since I'm the one who made the first proposal and Bob rejected it, I think I should get a better deal this time around.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.
