"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a middle ground. I'll take less this time, but I need more than 6000 to make this worth it. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hitting her much harder than me. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice! I'm increasing my offer, but we need to reach an agreement soon. Time is money!"" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a little more than 5500.  Let's make a deal before the value of the money drops further. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's still trying to hold out for a significantly larger share.  While 3500 is a decent amount, it's clear I have the upper hand with the inflation disparity. I need to push for a more even split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Offering a 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the inflation working against Alice.  This leaves no room for negotiation and makes it clear that I'm serious about getting an equitable deal. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept a fair offer or risk losing out significantly as the rounds progress."
