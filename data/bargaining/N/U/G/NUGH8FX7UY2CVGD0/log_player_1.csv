I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split, giving you the lion's share.  I believe this is fair given the potential for inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to take a more moderate approach this time, offering a 600,000 - 400,000 split.  It's still a majority for me, but more balanced than my previous offer.  I believe it's a fair offer that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is making this deal increasingly risky.  I'll accept Bob's offer to secure some of the money before it's worth even less."
