"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this round, but I'll give you a better deal next round if you reject this offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 3000/7000 split, but I'm willing to take a chance on Bob's promise of a better deal next round. I'll accept his offer for now.
