I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering the inflation will benefit me more. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the inflation and the fact that I'm likely to get nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
