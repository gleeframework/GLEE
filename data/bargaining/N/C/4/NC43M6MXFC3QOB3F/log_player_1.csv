"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to try to be fair, but I'm also going to try to get the most money I can. This offer gives Bob a small amount, but it's still better than nothing if he rejects it and we go into the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the money is losing value rapidly. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half, which is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
