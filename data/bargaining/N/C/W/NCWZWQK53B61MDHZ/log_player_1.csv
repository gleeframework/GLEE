"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'll have to be careful. Since Bob's offer is now a 50-50 split, and considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll decide to reject this offer and wait for a better deal. My next offer will be even more aggressive.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a more aggressive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is now a 55-45 split, which is a relatively close to my previous offer. However, considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about whether this is a good deal.

Since Bob's offer is slightly better than my previous offer, and considering the inflation, I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
