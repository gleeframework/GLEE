Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""That's a bit greedy Alice! I'm feeling generous, so let's be fairer. Take it while it's good!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down, but still need a decent share to make this worthwhile.  Accept, and we can both walk away with something good. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving in the right direction, the deal still heavily favors her.  It's worth seeing if I can get her closer to a 50/50 split in the next round, considering the money is losing value for both of us."
