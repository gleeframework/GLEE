"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you take 20. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount and can move on to the next round if we choose to."
