"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, Bob has the opportunity to consider Alice's offer of a 60-40 split. Given that the money's value decreases with each round due to inflation, Bob must weigh the immediate gain against the potential for a better offer in subsequent rounds. However, considering the inflation rates (10% for Bob and 20% for Alice), Bob might believe that holding out for a better deal in the next round could be advantageous. This is because the value of the money decreases more significantly for Alice, potentially making her more inclined to agree to a more favorable split for Bob in the future to avoid further devaluation of her share. Thus, Bob decides to reject the offer, aiming for a better deal in the next round. \n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what happens next. I'm ready to continue the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation and the fact that Alice's money value decreases more significantly, Bob might want to propose a deal that still seems reasonable but slightly more in his favor than the previous offer, anticipating that Alice might be more inclined to accept due to the devaluing of her potential share over time.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split slightly. I believe this is a fairer division given the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's response. I'm ready to continue the game."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time.  Inflation is hurting both of us, so a 50/50 split seems the most fair. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: At this point, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both parties, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable offer. Given that the money's value has decreased by 19% for Bob and 36% for Alice since the first round, the actual value of what they're splitting has diminished considerably. Since Alice is now offering a split that is more favorable to Bob than her initial offer, and considering the decreasing value of the money, it seems prudent for Bob to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer ensures Bob a gain that, while reduced by inflation, is still significant and not subject to further diminishment. \n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of the game. I'm ready for the conclusion."
