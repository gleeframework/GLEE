Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my last offer.  I'm willing to compromise, but if you reject it, we both lose a lot more. Let's find a solution before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting longer means Bob will get even less.
* **Alice's Offer:** While not ideal, 40% of a shrinking pot is better than nothing, which is what Bob gets if they fail to agree.
* **Time Pressure:** Only 7 rounds remain.  The longer Bob waits, the less negotiating power he has, and the worse the offers will likely become.

While Bob could gamble that Alice will get desperate and offer him a better deal, the risk of walking away with nothing is too high at this stage."
