"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000.  We both lose money if we wait. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. With inflation, the money is worth less for both of us, but more so for Alice. I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. You lose more if we wait, so let's settle on this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair deal.  We are both losing money by waiting, and this split ensures we both benefit more than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the inflation and the offers made so far, I think this is a reasonable split. I'm losing less value than Alice due to inflation, but her offer is closer to my previous proposal than I expected. It's better to accept now rather than risking further loss of value in subsequent rounds."
