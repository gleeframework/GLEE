"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $4,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob would gain $6,000, which is worth 5% less than his initial gain in round 1.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either. I'll accept this offer.
