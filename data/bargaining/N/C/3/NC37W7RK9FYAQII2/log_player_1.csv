Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better.  Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share this time.  It's a fair compromise given the inflation we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
