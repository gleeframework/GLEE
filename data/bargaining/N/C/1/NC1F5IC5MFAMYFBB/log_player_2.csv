Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and end this. Any more rounds and the inflation will eat us both alive. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's finally time to accept.  Alice is desperate and the deal will only get worse from here. Taking the guaranteed $500,000 is the best move now."
