"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll accept the offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
