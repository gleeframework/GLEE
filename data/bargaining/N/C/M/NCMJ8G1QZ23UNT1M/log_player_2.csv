"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm happy to take a slightly bigger share, but I believe we can find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. We're both losing value with each round, so a fair compromise is the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nThe offer seems reasonable, and considering the inflation, it's better to accept a fair split now rather than risking further devaluation."
