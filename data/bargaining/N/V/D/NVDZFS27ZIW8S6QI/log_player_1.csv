"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering I lose value each round.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. This seems reasonable, given that the money loses value for me with each passing round, but not for Bob. Let's see how he responds!"
