Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, as I will be taking the risk of being the first to propose.  I believe a good split like this will get the game rolling and we can both get a significant share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the risk of further rounds and the inflation. It's better to secure half than risk losing even more."
