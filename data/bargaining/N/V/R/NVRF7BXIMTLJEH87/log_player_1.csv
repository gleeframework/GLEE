"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, this time with a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not ready to accept a 50/50 split just yet. I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Getting closer, but I want a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, where I get 55 dollars and Bob gets 45 dollars. I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than the previous offers, while still being reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a decent one, and I'm willing to accept it. I was hoping to get a better deal, but 45/55 is a reasonable compromise. I'm not going to push my luck and risk getting an even worse deal. Let's settle on this offer and end the game!"
