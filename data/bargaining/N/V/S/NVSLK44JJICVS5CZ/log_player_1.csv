"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a pretty good deal for Bob, considering the inflation rate is 0% in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, but I think a more equitable split is in order. Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to keep most of the money, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less in each of the two rounds), I'll aim for a more equal split.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
