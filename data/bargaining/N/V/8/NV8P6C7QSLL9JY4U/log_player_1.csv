"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more equitable split this time. You still get the larger share, but we both benefit significantly.  Don't forget, inflation is eating away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
