Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We can avoid the risk of inflation and get our share sooner. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you want an even split, but the value decreases for you each round. This offer is closer to even considering the inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I still think an even split is the fairest option, even with the inflation. Let's avoid further risks. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate, which means time is on my side.  An even split might sound ""fair"" but it doesn't reflect the reality of the situation where his share is losing value. I need to incentivize him to accept a deal that benefits me more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need you to meet me halfway.  This offer is a good compromise - it accounts for the inflation affecting your share while still giving you a decent amount.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise a little more to avoid further losses due to inflation. This offer reflects a slight advantage for you, but also allows me to get a share before it's worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is finally moving in the right direction, and the longer this goes on the more likely he is to panic and offer me an even worse deal out of desperation.  This offer is still beneficial to me and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
