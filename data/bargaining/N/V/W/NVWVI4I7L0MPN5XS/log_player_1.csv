"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to propose a generous offer to Bob in the hopes of getting the money quickly, before inflation takes effect. I'll keep 90% of the money for myself and give Bob 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very greedy! While I'm losing only 10% of my potential gains due to inflation, he's losing 20% of his.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower share than my initial offer, but still a decent amount considering inflation.  Hopefully, he'll see it's in his best interest to accept before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still losing a significant amount due to inflation. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.  I need to try to get a deal that's more favorable to me before the money loses too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a lower offer again, but still one that seems fair to Bob. The inflation is starting to hurt significantly, so I need to find a middle ground before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is finally offering a 50/50 split.  While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, accepting this offer is the best option.  Rejecting it could lead to us both getting nothing."
