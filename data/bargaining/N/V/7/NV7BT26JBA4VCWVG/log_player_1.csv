"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a decent share for you 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer. If I accept, I'll gain $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. That's a significant decrease from my initial proposal of $5,000.

However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he'll gain $4,800 in terms of original value, which is 48% of the original $10,000. That's still a significant majority, but not as extreme as it seems at first glance.

I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less due to inflation for me, and I don't know the effect on Bob. I'll have to be more cautious with my offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I need something for my trouble.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on me! My gain is worth 27.1% less than the original $10,000, so I'll have to be very careful with my decision.

Considering the offer, I'll gain $2,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000. That's a relatively small share, but it's better than nothing.

However, Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, so he'll gain $5,200 in terms of original value, which is 52% of the original $10,000. That's a significant majority, but I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth even less due to inflation, and I don't know the effect on Bob. I'll have to be even more cautious with my offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1500,
  ""bob_gain"": 8500,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of patience, but I'll give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an even larger share, but I'm trying to get something for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
