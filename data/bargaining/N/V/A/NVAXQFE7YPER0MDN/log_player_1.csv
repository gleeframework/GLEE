Let's see if Bob is happy with a small share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more money, the inflation makes it clear that I'll get much less in the next round. It's better to accept this offer and secure a small gain."
