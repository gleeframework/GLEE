"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations.""
}

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain remaining at $500,000 and Bob's offer being worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider this new proposal carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and wait for a better deal.
