Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive opening offer, aiming for a large portion of the money. I think it's important to establish a strong starting point, and I'm confident Bob will be motivated to negotiate rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to accept this offer. Bob's offer is fair, and I'm not sure I can do much better in the subsequent rounds. There's always a chance of getting a better offer later, but also the risk of ending up with nothing.  It's a good compromise."
