# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot.  While the deal is getting worse, I'm betting she'll get more desperate as we get closer to the deadline and offer something more reasonable. I need to hold my nerve a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""I'm being generous, but this needs to settle soon.  Inflation is killing me!""} 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm slightly increasing my demand to test her resolve.  The message conveys a sense of urgency and slight frustration, which might push Alice to concede more in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed killing you, take this before it gets worse! 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still fixated on the inflation disadvantage, but her offer barely improved. This indicates a potential crack in her strategy.  I'll hold out a bit longer, demonstrating my unwillingness to accept an unfair deal. The pressure is mounting on her side, too."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this goes any further.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a bold move.  By framing this as my ""final offer"", I'm significantly increasing the pressure on Alice. It signals I'm willing to risk it all for a better share.  The offer is still tilted in my favor, but the inclusion of a clear ultimatum might be enough to sway her before we both lose out."
