Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I get $70, you get $30. This is a good deal for you in early rounds, as the value of the money decreases quickly for you.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a more even split, but the inflation hits you harder. Let's compromise - I'll take $65, you get $35. This is better than what you'd get if you reject and make an offer in round 4. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
