Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise, but still need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising slightly, she's not factoring in the significant inflation hitting her end. It's still advantageous for Bob to hold out for a better deal. Each round that Bob rejects, Alice's potential gains decrease significantly, making her more likely to accept a deal favorable to Bob."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the inflation is only getting worse for you. This is a fair offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it down the middle, last reasonable offer 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob had the upper hand due to inflation, Alice is now offering an even split.  Given the remaining rounds and the risk of getting $0 if no agreement is reached, accepting the even split is the most logical choice.  It guarantees Bob a reasonable share without risking everything on a potentially unattainable better deal."
