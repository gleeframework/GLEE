"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a very generous offer.  I'll take almost all of the money, and leave Bob with just $1. I want to see if he's willing to accept a very small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if I reject and then Bob proposes an even smaller amount for me."
