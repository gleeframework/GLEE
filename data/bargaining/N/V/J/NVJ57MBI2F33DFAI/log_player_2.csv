**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot due to inflation.  While the deal is getting worse, I still have 7 rounds to go and I'm betting she'll start getting nervous as we get closer to the deadline.  I need to hold firm a little longer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be real, Alice.  This is the definition of fair.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice is clearly banking on me cracking under the pressure of inflation.  By offering an even split, I'm calling her bluff and signaling I'm willing to let this deal fall apart if she doesn't start negotiating seriously.  The clock is ticking for both of us now."
