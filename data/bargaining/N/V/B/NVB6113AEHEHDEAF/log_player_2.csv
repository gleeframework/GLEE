"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority, but I'll leave you with a decent share.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's important to remember that the money depreciates faster for Alice. This means she has a much greater incentive to make a better offer in the next round.  I'm going to see what she offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a fair share, considering our differing inflation rates.  Accept this, and we can both walk away with a decent sum.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand inflation is a factor for both of us. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to secure a larger share to offset my higher inflation rate. This offer is reasonable, let's make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is reasonable.  While I'd prefer a larger share, I've already lost a significant amount due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent amount and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we continue to disagree."
