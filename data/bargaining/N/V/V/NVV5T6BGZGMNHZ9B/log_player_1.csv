Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair: a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation means I lose out in the long run. I need to push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out. This offer is fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting better, but it's still not enough to offset the impact of inflation for me. I need to hold out for a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure and the inflation working against me.  Let's close this deal.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is significantly impacting your potential gains. I'm offering you a deal where you still come out ahead compared to holding out much longer. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation escalating, my potential gains are diminishing quickly. While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer now guarantees me something rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
