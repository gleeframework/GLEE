Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Let's try a 60/40 split this time. It's still a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation rate is affecting you more than me.  Let's come to an agreement before we lose too much money!
