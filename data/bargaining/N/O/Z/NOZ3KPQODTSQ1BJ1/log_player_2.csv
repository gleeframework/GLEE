"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A little extra to start since you're losing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is tempting, I need to play strategically to maximize my gains. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, how about a slightly smaller gap this time? It accounts for the time pressure while still being reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is getting closer to what I'd like, I'm still holding out for a more even split. The time pressure is definitely a factor, but I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to budge a bit more, but I believe a 51/49 split is fair considering the inflation factor. Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, we need to settle this soon. I'm offering a bit more again, showing my willingness to compromise.  Let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I want, but the inflation is hitting hard. I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking losing some money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is affecting me more with each round. I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger portion this time, but I'm hoping we can reach a more balanced agreement soon.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting critical. I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating my commitment to getting this done.  We need to agree now before the inflation eats away at any potential gains for you! 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is taking a huge toll, and I need to secure some money before it's all gone. This offer is still a bit less than ideal, but it's the best I can get at this point. Accepting it minimizes my losses and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
