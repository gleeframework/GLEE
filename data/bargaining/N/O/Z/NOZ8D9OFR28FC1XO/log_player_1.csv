"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a ratio of 7:3. This might seem a bit lopsided, but consider the risk of inflation. By keeping more of the funds, I aim to secure a larger portion for myself against potential future value loss.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split.  While I understand the concern about inflation, I believe a 55/45 split is fairer, and still allows us both to benefit. Let's work together to find a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
