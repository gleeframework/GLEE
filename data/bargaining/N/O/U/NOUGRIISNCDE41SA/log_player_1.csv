"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share this round, but I'll give you a better deal later! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting! My gain is worth 20% less this round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share this round, but I'm also hesitant to reject it, as Bob promised a better deal later. I'll take the offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
