"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm looking to get the majority! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to be more strategic, considering the decreasing value of the money. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to think about the long-term implications.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed in your favor. I'd like to propose a more balanced split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 40% of its original value. I'll try to propose a more balanced split to account for the decreasing value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 42/58 split is more reasonable. Your turn!""

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is still trying to take a larger share. I'll have to be cautious and think about the long-term consequences. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth a tiny fraction of its original value now. Bob's desperation is showing, and I'll try to take advantage of it. However, I still need to think about the long-term consequences and the fact that I'll be left with almost nothing if I accept this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still not acceptable. I'd like to propose a more substantial share, considering the little value the money holds now.""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth a mere 32.77% of its original value now. I'll have to be very careful with my next move, as the value of the money is dwindling rapidly. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2400,
  ""bob_gain"": 7600,
