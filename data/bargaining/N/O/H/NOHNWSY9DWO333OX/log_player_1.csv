"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that I get $900,000, and Bob gets $100,000. This gives me a good start, and hopefully, Bob will accept it, as it's better than getting nothing in the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, accepting this offer means I get $100,000, whereas rejecting it risks getting nothing in the end. It's not a great deal, but it's better than nothing."
