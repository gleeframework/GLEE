Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm offering you 45 dollars which is more than the 40 you offered me.  This deal makes sense considering the shrinking pot. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
