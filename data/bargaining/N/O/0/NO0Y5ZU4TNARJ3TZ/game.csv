4500.0,5500.0,"I think it's fair that we both get a decent share. How about 5500 for me and 4500 for you? This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about the inflation eating into our gains.",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a better share than 4500. Let's split it 60/40, that's a fair compromise considering inflation.",Alice,3,
