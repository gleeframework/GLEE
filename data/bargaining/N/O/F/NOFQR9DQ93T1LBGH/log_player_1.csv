Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, but a 55/45 split in my favor is more reasonable considering the devaluation. This ensures a fairer outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
