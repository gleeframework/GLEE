"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but it is still a fair offer in the sense that Bob gets something. I am taking into account the risk of inflation and the possibility that Bob might reject this offer and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, it's still a decent amount of money, especially considering the inflation factor. It's important to note that Bob's offer is worth 5% less for him, so there's a chance he might have been willing to accept my initial offer if he knew about the inflation affecting his gain.  

However, rejecting this offer means starting another round with a further 10% decrease in my potential gain. This risk is too high, and accepting this offer is the more logical choice."
