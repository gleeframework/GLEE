"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 900,000/100,000 split.  This should be a good starting point, as it gives me the majority of the money but also leaves something for Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept, since I'm offering him a decent sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred more, it's clear Bob is determined to get the lion's share. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least something, and considering the inflation, the value of the money I'd receive in future rounds is likely to be even less.  It's better to take what I can get now."
