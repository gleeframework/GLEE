"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $500,000 and take $500,000 for myself, and inviting him to make a proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a better deal, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $500,000 gain from the first round is now worth $450,000 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up a larger share of the money. However, I'd rather not risk going to the next round with even lower value money. I'll accept Bob's offer.
