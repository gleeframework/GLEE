Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is on my side. Alice is experiencing significant inflation, making each round less valuable for her. I'm willing to push my advantage a bit further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 51,
""alice_gain"": 49,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm nudging my offer a bit closer to even, but maintaining a slight advantage. The ""final offer"" statement adds pressure.  Alice is likely feeling the pressure of inflation and might accept a less-than-ideal offer rather than risk getting nothing."
