"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fair offer in my opinion, considering the risk of inflation.  I am willing to give Bob a small portion of the money to hopefully secure a deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, even considering the inflation. I will reject this offer and continue the game, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm increasing my offer for Bob slightly, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  This offer still leaves me with the majority of the money but shows some compromise after his previous rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is not ideal, the continued inflation means I will likely get a worse deal with each passing round.  A 50/50 split is the best I can realistically hope for at this point."
