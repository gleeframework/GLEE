"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. I've included a message saying ""Let's be reasonable"" to convey that my offer is fair and that we should try to come to an agreement quickly to avoid losing value due to inflation. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fairer, but I'm willing to give you a slight advantage to get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't feel pressured by inflation. On the other hand, Bob's offer gives me $450,000, which is less than what I offered myself in the previous round ($550,000). Given that I have the upper hand in terms of inflation impact, I will reject Bob's offer in hopes of getting a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if I can negotiate a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to take advantage of Bob's decreasing valuation of the money due to inflation. Since Bob is more eager to reach an agreement, I'll offer him a slightly smaller share than before. I'll propose that Bob gets $420,000, which is less than the $450,000 I offered initially, and I'll keep $580,000 for myself. I'll attach a message saying ""Time is running out"" to emphasize the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Time is running out""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it down the middle and be done with it. We're both losing money with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, considering that the money is worth 14.26% less for Bob than in the first round, his half is actually worth less than it appears. Meanwhile, my half remains unaffected by inflation. Given this advantage, I'm inclined to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if I can take advantage of Bob's growing impatience!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to capitalize on Bob's increasing desperation due to the inflation. Since Bob is more eager to reach an agreement, I'll offer him a slightly smaller share than before. I'll propose that Bob gets $400,000, which is less than the $420,000 I offered in Round 3, and I'll keep $600,000 for myself. I'll attach a message saying ""You're running out of time"" to emphasize the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain and to create a sense of urgency.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""You're running out of time""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
