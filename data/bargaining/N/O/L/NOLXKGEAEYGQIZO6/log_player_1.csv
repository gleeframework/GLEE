"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 3200 in real terms. Considering Bob's gain of 6000 is still worth 6000, this is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for less.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think I deserve more after rejecting your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting, and my gain is worth significantly less now. I need to be careful not to give away too much.

Considering the current state of the game, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me. My gain of 3500 is worth around 2800 in real terms, which is still a decent amount, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for less than I could get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
