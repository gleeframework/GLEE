"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a bigger share.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting, and my share is worth even less now!

I'll think carefully about Alice's new offer. Given the reduced value of the money, I'll accept this offer to get something, rather than risking another round of inflation.
