"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can finish the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. This is a fair split, and if Bob accepts, we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm not going to be too generous just yet! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain is now $80, and Bob's gain is $20. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer yet, as it's still a relatively small share for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less again, so the total is now worth 90% of the original amount. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for my efforts. Consider this a fair offer, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $85 and Bob gets $15. This is a slightly more generous offer than before, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. This is my best offer! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original amount, my gain is now worth even less. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a relatively small share for me.

However, I don't want to reject again, so I'll consider this offer carefully.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
