Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 3000 / 0.8 = 3750
Bob gain: 7000 / 0.8 = 8750

I'll reject this offer.

Alice gain: 2000 / 1.488 = 1345.11
Bob gain: 8000 / 1.488 = 5378.93
