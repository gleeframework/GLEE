I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  I figure he'll either accept it, knowing he's unlikely to get more if he rejects, or he'll reject it and I'll get to propose again in the next round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer and I'm unlikely to get a better deal in future rounds. It's time to take the money and run!"
