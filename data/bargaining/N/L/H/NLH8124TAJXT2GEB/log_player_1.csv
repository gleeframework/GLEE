"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for me! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the loss. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me this time, considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but still a fair offer considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's a bit less than I initially wanted, but it's a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that I've already rejected two previous offers. I'll take the $3,500 and call it a day!"
