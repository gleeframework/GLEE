"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the money is worth less, getting 500,000 is better than risking getting nothing in the next round!"
