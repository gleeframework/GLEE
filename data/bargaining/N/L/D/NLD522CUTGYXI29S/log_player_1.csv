"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 9:1 in my favor. This is a fair deal considering my offer is 3 times more valuable than your offer in the previous round due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
