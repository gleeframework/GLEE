"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. While this is still a significant gain for Bob, it is a compromise considering his previous offer and the ongoing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  Inflation is hitting hard now, and I need to secure a larger portion to protect my gains. While this is still a significant amount for Bob, it reflects the current value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is the best I've seen in a few rounds.  With inflation continuing, I'm likely to get a worse deal if I reject and he makes the next offer."
