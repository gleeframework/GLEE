"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. Since the money depreciates for him much faster, even that small amount is worth more to him than nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split seems fair, I can do better.  The money is depreciating much faster for Bob than for me. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'll offer Bob $100,000. While I'm taking the majority, this is still a significant gain for him considering the rate of depreciation. It's better for him to take this now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than in the previous round, it's still not enough.  The money is depreciating rapidly for him, so he has a strong incentive to reach an agreement. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000. This is a significant gain for him given how much the money is depreciating.  If he rejects this, he risks losing even more in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 333333.33 
# Bob gain: 666666.67 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal split, but I'm confident I can get even more. With the money depreciating so quickly for him, he's in a tougher position than I am."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000.  This is a sizable gain for him, and I believe he'll be more willing to accept it given the increasing depreciation.  The clock is ticking, and he needs to act quickly to avoid losing more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more tempting, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. The depreciation rate for Bob is increasing rapidly, and he's running out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000. This is still a very good deal for him, given the rapid depreciation of his money.  It's getting very risky for him to keep rejecting offers, and I'm confident he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 444444.44 
# Bob gain: 555555.56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more tempting, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  He's running out of time, and the money is depreciating faster for him with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm offering a 50/50 split. The inflation is taking a toll on Bob, and he's unlikely to get a better deal at this point. This is a fair and reasonable offer considering the circumstances."
