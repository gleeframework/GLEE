I want to see what kind of offer Alice will make next, and I hope I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we should split it evenly this time. 60/40 is a bit unfair.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While I would prefer an even split, it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
