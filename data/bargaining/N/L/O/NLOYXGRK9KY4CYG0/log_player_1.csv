"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, let's go for 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45$ is actually worth 95% of 45, which is 42.75$. I'm not thrilled with this proposal, but it's a more even split than my initial offer. I'll accept this offer to move on to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
