"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, I'll have to consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power, not just its nominal value.

However, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable starting point. I'll accept this offer.
