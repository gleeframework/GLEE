"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can avoid the risk of inflation."

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less, I need to be more aggressive to get a good deal.

I reject Bob's offer. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not good enough, Bob. I want more.""

# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give you a better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
