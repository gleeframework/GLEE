I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but leaves a decent portion for Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, and I won't accept it.  It's my turn to propose next, and I'll need to be more strategic considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to make the offer more appealing, but I still need to account for the inflation that affects my gains."
