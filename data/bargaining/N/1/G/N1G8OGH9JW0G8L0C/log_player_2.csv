"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. This offer benefits us both given the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the inflation rate, Alice's share will be worth less in the next round, so I might be able to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more balanced offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, and the value decreases. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nSince the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, and Alice's share is worth significantly less due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate an even better deal in the next round. Alice's ""final offer"" might be a bluff, and I'm willing to take that risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Given the significant decrease in value for you, I believe this offer is more than fair.""}"
