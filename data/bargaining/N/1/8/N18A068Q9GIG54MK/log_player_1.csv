I'm going to be greedy and try to secure most of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will accept.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the money is losing value quickly. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure at least half of the money, even if it's worth less than the initial round."
