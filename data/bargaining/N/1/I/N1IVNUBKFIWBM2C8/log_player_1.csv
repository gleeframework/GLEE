"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 40% of the initial amount, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is quite aggressive, considering the inflation. However, I'll have to consider the fact that the money I gain is worth 5% less than before.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```

}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the aggressive offer from Bob in round 2, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you a slightly larger share, but still a bit more than 40% of the initial amount. Let's see if you'll accept this offer!"

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is getting more aggressive again, considering the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. However, I'll have to consider the fact that the money I gain is worth significantly less than before.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the aggressive offers from Bob in the previous rounds, I'll try to make a more cautious offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise given the current situation. Let's see if you'll accept this offer!"
