75.0,25.0,I propose dividing the $100 in a 75/25 split. This offers a reasonable share for both of us considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the initial amount. This offer still leaves you with a decent portion, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
