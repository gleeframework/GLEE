"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 90/10, with me taking the larger share.  This is a fair starting point, and leaves room for negotiation if you'd like to see a more even split.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 90/10 split. How about a 50/50 split to start? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
