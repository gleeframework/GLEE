"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
