Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems fair to me since the money is worth less to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  My share is slightly lower, but Bob's share is much lower due to the higher inflation rate he faces. If I reject, I risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
