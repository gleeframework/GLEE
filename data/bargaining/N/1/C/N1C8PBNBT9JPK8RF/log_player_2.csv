"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal. The 10% inflation rate for me is a significant concern, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get more than $4000. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm taking into account the inflation rates for both of us. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. Offering Alice $4500, which is 45% of the original amount, seems reasonable considering her lower inflation rate of 5%. Let's see if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting you harder, Bob. I suggest we settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision. The money I gain is now worth 19% less than in the first round, and this offer is relatively close to the original offer from Alice. Continuing to reject offers in hopes of a better deal may lead to significantly diminished returns due to the high inflation rate affecting me. Accepting $4200 now seems more secure than risking further devaluation."
