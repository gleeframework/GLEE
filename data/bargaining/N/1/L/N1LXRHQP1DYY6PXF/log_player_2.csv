Round 4

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm sticking with 55/45.  Accept it before inflation eats away at any potential gains for us!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're stuck. I'm willing to compromise slightly more. 57/43. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 57/43 split in round 7 is better than risking a complete loss with continued inflation.  The longer Bob waits, the less his share is worth, making Alice's offer increasingly tempting.
