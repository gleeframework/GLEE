Let's start fair. I propose a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'll increase my share slightly, but still offer a decent amount to Bob. Since the money is now worth less for me, I need to be more strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair, and I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation. I need to try to regain some control."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my share again, but still leaving a substantial portion for Bob. He needs to realize that if he keeps rejecting, he risks getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unreasonable. I'm losing a huge amount of value due to inflation, and he's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'll keep fighting for a more equitable share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm taking a bolder stance this time. Bob is clearly being stubborn, so I'm raising my share significantly to show him that I'm serious about getting a fair deal. He's risking a lot by continuing to reject my offers, and this time, he'll need to consider if his pride is worth losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is pushing his luck. I'm losing more and more value with each round, but I refuse to be bullied into accepting such an unfair offer. It's time for him to realize that he can't keep exploiting the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

This is my final stand. I'm taking the majority of the money, leaving Bob with a meager share. He's left with a simple choice: accept a small amount or get nothing. I'm not willing to lose more value, and I'm confident that Bob will eventually realize that he's better off accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly stubborn and greedy. While the money is worth significantly less for me now, I won't accept such a ridiculously unfair offer. I'm still willing to fight for a better deal, even if it means we both might get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my last offer. I'm taking almost everything, leaving Bob with a tiny share. He's pushed his luck for too long, and now he's facing the consequences. If he rejects this offer, we both get nothing. It's time for him to be realistic and accept what's left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is insulting, even considering the inflation. I would rather get nothing than accept this unfair deal. It seems Bob is intent on being greedy and taking advantage of the situation, even if it means both of us lose."
