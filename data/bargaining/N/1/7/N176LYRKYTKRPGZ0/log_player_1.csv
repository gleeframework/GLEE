Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the minimum, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's a significant reduction from the initial split, the inflation is eating away at my gains and it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
