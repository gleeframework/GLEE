Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but leaving a little for Bob. Hopefully, it's enough to make him accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much lower than my initial proposal, and while I'm losing value each round, I'm losing it at a faster rate than Bob is. I'm going to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than he offered me, but still taking the majority. I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept, as he's losing value at a slower rate than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still less than what I offered him in the previous round, even though the value of the money is decreasing for me. While it is tempting, I'm holding out for a better deal. I'm losing money faster than Bob, but I'm still in a strong negotiating position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than his last offer. I'm still holding out for a larger share, but I recognize that the inflation is starting to hurt my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the value of the money has decreased significantly for me, Bob's offer is the best I've seen so far. At this point, the risk of continued rejection and further inflation outweighs the possibility of getting a slightly better deal. It's time to accept and secure a sizable chunk of the money."
