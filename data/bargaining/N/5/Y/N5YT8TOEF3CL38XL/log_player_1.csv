"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. It's a decent split, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation rate, my $5,000 would be worth 9,090.91 (10,000 x 0.9) in the first round's value, and Bob's $5,000 would be worth 9,500 (10,000 x 0.95).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll have to weigh the pros and cons. For now, I'll decide to...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","It's my turn again! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, offering Bob a bit less than before. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

Let's calculate the values in the first round's terms:

My $5,500 would be worth 4,185 (10,000 x 0.4185) in the first round's value.
Bob's $4,500 would be worth 4,550 (10,000 x 0.455) in the first round's value.

Bob's current offer is:

Alice gain: 5200
Bob gain: 4800

In the first round's value, my $5,200 would be worth 4,184 (10,000 x 0.4184) and Bob's $4,800 would be worth 4,560 (10,000 x 0.456) in the first round's value.

It looks like Bob is offering me a slightly worse deal than before, but the inflation is making it harder to compare. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

Let's calculate the values in the first round's terms:

My $5,100 would be worth 2,919.45 (10,000 x 0.291945) in the first round's value.
Bob's $4,900 would be worth 4,590 (10,000 x 0.459) in the first round's value.

It looks like Bob is offering me a slightly worse deal than before, and I'm not sure if I should accept. But I have to consider the fact that the money is worth less and less with each passing round...
