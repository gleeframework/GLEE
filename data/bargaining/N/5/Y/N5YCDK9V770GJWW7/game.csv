300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, that's a very generous offer on your part, but I'm sure you understand it's not acceptable for me. Let's be reasonable: I'll take 70%, you take 30%. We can avoid wasting time on further negotiation.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's try a 50/50 split. It's fair, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. This is a much better deal for you than the previous round, and avoids further losses from inflation.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise and offer you 60% of the money, but I need at least 40% for myself. We're losing money with every round, so let's find a solution that benefits us both.",Alice,5,
