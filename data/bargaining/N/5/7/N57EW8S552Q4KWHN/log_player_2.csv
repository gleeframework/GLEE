"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 90, and you get 10.  It's a good deal for both of us!  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me only 10% of the money!  There's plenty of time left, and I'm sure we can find a better solution.  Let's see what you have to offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I'll take 60, and you get 40. It's a fair split, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll meet you halfway this time.  Let's split it 70/30.  If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose out in the end. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm losing value with each round, I'm still confident we can find a more equitable split.  I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal.  Let's see what you have to offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Look, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's just split it evenly and be done with this.  50/50 is fair, and we can both walk away with something.""}
