"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll take 60% and Bob can have 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting offer, considering that the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob in this round, his $5000 is actually equivalent to $4500 in real value. Meanwhile, my $5000 is still worth the full amount. I think I can get a better deal, considering the effects of inflation. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation""}\n\nI'll take 55% and Bob can have 45%. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each round, his $4500 in this round is actually equivalent to $4050 in real value. Meanwhile, my $5500 is still worth the full amount. I think this is a reasonable offer, considering the effects of inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
