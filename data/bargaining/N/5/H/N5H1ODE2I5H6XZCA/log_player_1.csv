"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly. This is a good starting point for a fair negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the uneven split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'm not as concerned about the absolute values as I was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round.
