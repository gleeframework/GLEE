**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting closer to something acceptable, time is working against Bob much more than Alice.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything better than an even split from here on out.  It's time to push the advantage of Bob's rapidly devaluing money and hope Alice gets nervous."
