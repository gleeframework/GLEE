"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less to begin with""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, which is a relatively small amount to start with, and I'm keeping 80 dollars for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm still being generous 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 10% less, so the actual value of the money I gain is 0.9 * 60 = 54 dollars.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving up 40 dollars, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to give up that much yet""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, so the actual value of the money I gain is 0.9 * 54 = 48.6 dollars.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's only fair 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really kicking in now! With a 27.1% reduction, my potential gain is now worth 0.727 * 80 = 58.16 dollars.

Considering Bob's offer, meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, especially since I'm not getting any younger. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's meet in the middle, I'm tired of negotiating""
}
```"
