"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer is a 60/40 split in my favor, which I believe is a fair starting point. I anticipate Bob will reject this offer as he will be incentivized to wait for a larger share due to the higher inflation rate on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome for both of us. The 5% inflation on my end is less than the 20% inflation on Bob's end, so I'm better off taking this offer than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
