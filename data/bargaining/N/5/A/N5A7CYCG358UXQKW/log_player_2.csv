"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I think this offer benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money's value decreases over rounds, it's strategic to aim for a higher share early on. With a 5% decrease in value for me (Bob) and a 20% decrease for Alice, there's a significant difference in how the value of money holds up for each of us. Given Alice's offer of a 40-60 split, I believe I can negotiate for a better share in subsequent rounds as the pressure of decreasing value mounts, especially on Alice's side. Accepting the first offer without trying to negotiate for more seems premature."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince I rejected Alice's initial offer, it's now my turn to propose a division. Considering the impact of inflation on both of us, but more significantly on Alice, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split than the initial offer but still be cautious not to push too far, as Alice might reject and we'd both lose value in the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 55,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer gives you a better deal than the next round, even with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven the current state of inflation and its impact on both of our potential gains, Alice's offer of a 45-55 split seems more reasonable than the initial 40-60 split, especially considering the devaluation of money over rounds. Since the money's value decreases more significantly for Alice, her willingness to offer a slightly better deal indicates an understanding of the pressure to settle before further devaluation. Given the decreasing value of money and the risk of further negotiations not yielding a significantly better offer, accepting this proposal seems prudent.
