I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm giving Bob something to make it seem fair.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is laughable! I'll get 100,000 while he gets 900,000? I'm not going to let him get away with that.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer, but I'll still take the majority of the money. This should be a more appealing deal for Bob than the last round.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too high for me.  I'm not going to give him almost three quarters of the money. I'm hoping he'll realize he needs to make a better offer to get anything at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 576000, ""bob_gain"": 424000}
```

I'm still going to take the majority, but I'm going to try to be more reasonable.  Time is running out, and I want to make sure I get something, but I also want to be fair."
