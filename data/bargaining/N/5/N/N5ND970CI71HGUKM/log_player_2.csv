"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a fair deal for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a fairer split, and it gives us both a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than that. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a good deal considering the inflation and we are getting closer to a 50/50 split.  Let's end it here."
