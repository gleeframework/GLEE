"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a 5% bite out of my potential gain, I'm not as enthusiastic about Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a more significant share. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
