"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid the value of the money decreasing over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.
