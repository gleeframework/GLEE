"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will be enticed by the prospect of getting anything at all.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something, I believe I can do better by continuing the game.  Inflation will hurt me more in the later rounds, so I need to act decisively and try to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try to be a bit more generous this round, but still aiming for a significant share. I'm hoping Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds and the increasing value of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his last one, it's still not acceptable.  The inflation is starting to really bite, but I need to hold out for a more equitable split.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm sticking to a similar strategy, but adjusting the offer to be more appealing to Bob while still maintaining a good share for myself. The pressure is mounting, but I'm confident I can get a better deal by staying in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  The inflation is really starting to hit, but I'm not ready to give up yet.  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a more favorable split by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

The pressure is mounting, but I'm making one final attempt at a more equitable split.  I'm reducing my share again, hoping Bob will see the value in accepting a deal before the inflation eats away too much of my share."
