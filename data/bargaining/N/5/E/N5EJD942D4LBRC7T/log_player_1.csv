"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to get something out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than my initial offer. However, I'm still not sure if I want to give up a significant portion of the money.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob a chance to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I suggest we adjust our offers accordingly. This proposal aims for a fair division given the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, I need to be more cautious with my offers. Bob's proposal seems reasonable, considering the reduced value of money. I'll accept his offer to avoid further losses.
