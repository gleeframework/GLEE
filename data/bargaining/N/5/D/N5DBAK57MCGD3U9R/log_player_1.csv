"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll be generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain is now 855,000 (900,000 - 5% of 900,000).

I don't think I want to give Bob the majority of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground and offer Bob a decent amount, while still keeping a significant portion for myself."

I'm getting closer to the middle, but I'm not willing to give Bob the majority of the money yet. Here's my response:
