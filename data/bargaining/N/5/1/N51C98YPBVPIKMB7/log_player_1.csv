"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself, which I believe is a reasonable and fair split. I'm hoping Bob will see it that way too and we can conclude the game quickly. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is meant to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer of a 50/50 split might seem fair at first glance, I need to consider the impact of inflation on the money. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, but 20% less to Bob, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. By rejecting this offer, I'll get the chance to propose a new division that takes into account the effects of inflation. Let's see what I can come up with!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less to Bob than it was in the first round, but still worth the same to me. I'll try to make an offer that is slightly more favorable to me, while still being reasonable for Bob.

### {""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split""}\n\nI've increased my share to $6500 and decreased Bob's share to $3500, citing the effects of inflation as the reason for this adjustment. I'm hoping Bob will see the logic in this proposal and accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 3500 to make this worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob has offered a compromise, but it's actually the same offer I made in the first round. Considering the effects of inflation, this offer is actually more favorable to me now than it was in the first round, since the money is worth 48.8% less to Bob. Given this, I'm willing to accept this offer and conclude the game.
