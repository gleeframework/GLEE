"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it quickly.  Since the money loses value faster for him, I think he'll be more likely to take a smaller share sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering me a much larger share than I offered him, and while the money is worth less now,  I'm going to hold out for a better deal. I think I can get more than 60% in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I'm still going to try and get the majority of the money.  Since Bob is losing value at a faster rate, he might be willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a lot lower than what I initially hoped for, but with the inflation eating away at the value of the money, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. At this point, I'm willing to take the 45% share to avoid getting nothing."
