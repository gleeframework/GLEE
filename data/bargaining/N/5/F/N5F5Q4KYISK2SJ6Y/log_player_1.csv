"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I value fairness, the decreasing value of money makes this a more advantageous offer for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
