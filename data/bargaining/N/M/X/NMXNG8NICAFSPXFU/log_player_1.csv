"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $8,000 and you can have $2,000. Then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I'd rather get something now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come."
