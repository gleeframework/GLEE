"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a division of $1,000,000 where I, Alice, receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. My message to Bob is ""Let's split fairly,"" indicating that this division is slightly in my favor but still offers Bob a significant amount, considering the penalty he faces with each passing round. This initial offer tests Bob's willingness to negotiate and sets the stage for potential future offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, as it reflects our respective contributions to this game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because it significantly favors him, especially considering the inflation penalty he faces. His proposed division of $450,000 for me and $550,000 for him is the opposite of my initial offer, and accepting it would mean I lose out on $100,000 compared to my initial proposal. Since the money's value remains the same for me but decreases for Bob with each round, I have an incentive to continue negotiating for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I increase my proposed gain to $580,000 and decrease Bob's share to $420,000. Given that the money's value decreases by 5% for Bob with each round, the actual value he would receive is less than the nominal amount. My message points out that considering the effects of inflation, this offer is more favorable to Bob than it initially appears. By factoring in the loss of value over time, I aim to create a sense of urgency and make my offer more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation, I'm willing to reduce my share slightly, but I still believe a split closer to 50/50 is fair. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer in round 4 because, despite his slight concession due to inflation, the proposed division still does not favor me as much as I believe it should, given the cumulative effect of inflation on his share. Bob's offer of $480,000 for me and $520,000 for him is closer to a 50/50 split but does not sufficiently account for the 14.26% decrease in value he faces. Since I incur no penalty from waiting, I can afford to continue negotiating for a better deal, hoping that the increasing pressure from inflation will prompt Bob to offer more favorable terms in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, this is a good deal considering.""}\n\n###\n\nIn round 5, I increase my proposed share to $600,000, leaving Bob with $400,000. Given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings at this stage (a 14.26% decrease in value from the first round), I emphasize in my message that this offer is more generous than it seems when considering the diminishing value of the money for Bob. By highlighting the effects of inflation, I aim to persuade Bob that accepting this offer is in his best interest, as further rounds would only decrease the real value of his potential gains. This strategy leverages the time pressure and the asymmetric effects of inflation to negotiate a deal more favorable to me."
