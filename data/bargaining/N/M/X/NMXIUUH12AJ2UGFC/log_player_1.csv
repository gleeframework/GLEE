Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a generous (for me) first offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get something.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred more, with inflation looming I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the next round. This is a decent split and ensures I get something."
