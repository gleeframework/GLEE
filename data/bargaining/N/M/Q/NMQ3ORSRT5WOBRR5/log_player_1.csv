I'm going for a high share in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted by a quick payout.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being quite generous with this offer. I'm going to reject it though. I can still get a better deal, especially since inflation is hitting me harder. I'll see if I can make a more favorable proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference between our previous offers. This should be more appealing to Bob than my last proposal, and still gives me a good chunk of the money."
