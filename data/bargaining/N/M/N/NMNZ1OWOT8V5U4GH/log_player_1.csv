Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share Alice, but I'm proposing a more balanced split. Consider the declining value and let's close this deal quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  Let's settle this now - you're losing value much faster than I am. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

This is still too close to Bob's initial offer and favors him significantly due to the inflation difference. We need to push for a better deal while time allows."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it.  I'm matching your last offer, but switching the amounts. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

This is a tricky situation. Bob is clearly trying to use the inflation difference to his advantage. However, accepting this offer would mean settling for less than what we were offered in Round 2 (after accounting for inflation). It's a gamble, but we need to push our luck a little further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting risky.  While not ideal, a 50/50 split minimizes further losses due to inflation for both sides. This offer has a strong chance of being accepted by Bob as it represents a fair deal given the circumstances."
