"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a generous 40% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can wrap up the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm being too greedy, huh?

I'm not going to compromise just yet. I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll consider 50-50, but no less.""
}
```

I'm still hoping to get a fair share, and 50-50 seems like a reasonable compromise."

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45.""

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting! My gain is worth less than 50% of the original amount now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll do better than 30%, but not 40%.""

I'm trying to stay firm, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll aim for 35% this time."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure I want to give up so much control. I'll think carefully before making a decision. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""80% is too steep, I'd rather take a chance on a better offer.""
}
```
