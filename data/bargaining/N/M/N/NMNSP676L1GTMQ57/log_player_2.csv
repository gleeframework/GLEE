**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, and while she's making small concessions, time is working against us more than her.  We need to incentivize her to settle quickly. By rejecting this offer, we show her we're serious about getting a better deal and increase the pressure to negotiate."
