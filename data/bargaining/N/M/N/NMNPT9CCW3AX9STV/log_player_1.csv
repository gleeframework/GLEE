I propose to keep 900,000 dollars for myself and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, giving me the majority but ensuring Bob gets something as well.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's not a good long-term strategy.  I know inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, but I'd rather risk another round and try to negotiate a better deal.  If I accept, I'm essentially giving Bob a huge advantage, and I'm confident I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

Since Bob rejected my first offer, and I rejected his, it's clear we both want a bigger share. However, I need to be cautious with inflation. This offer keeps me as the main beneficiary, but gives Bob a larger share to potentially incentivize acceptance. Let's see if he's willing to budge."
