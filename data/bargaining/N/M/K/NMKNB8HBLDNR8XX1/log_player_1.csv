"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable here, I'll give you a larger share than the previous offer.  Think about it carefully -  this is your chance to get a piece of the pie before inflation kicks in! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation kicking in, my gain of $4000 is worth less than I'd like. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my counteroffer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to lowball me, Bob! I'm not afraid to walk away and let the pie get smaller.""
}"
