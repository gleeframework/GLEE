"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a good start to the negotiations! 

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $160,000 (80% of $200,000). This is a relatively small amount, but I'll have to consider the fact that the money is worth less in real terms.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a majority. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give you a majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard! My gain of $100,000 is actually worth only $51,200 (48.8% of $100,000).

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the small consolation prize, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and get some money.
