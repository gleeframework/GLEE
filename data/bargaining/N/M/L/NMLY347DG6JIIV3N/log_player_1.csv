"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping this is a good enough offer to secure the money quickly and avoid the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. Inflation will eat away at my potential earnings if I keep rejecting offers.  A 60/40 split is a decent outcome given the circumstances."
