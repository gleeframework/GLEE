Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'll take the majority, but you still get a decent share.  Accept and we're done! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not willing to accept such an uneven split, especially since the money is worth less to me with each passing round. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still think the offer is not fair, considering the impact of inflation on my share. I'd like to make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and reduce my share slightly.
