"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share, but don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a generous offer considering the potential for inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it more evenly this time, but I'm keeping an eye on the inflation. Let's see if we can come to a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully.

However, Bob's offer is more even this time, and I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
