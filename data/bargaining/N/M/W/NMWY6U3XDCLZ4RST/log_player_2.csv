**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are rapidly eroding Bob's potential gains. Accepting Alice's current offer, while significantly less than desired, is better than risking an even worse outcome in subsequent rounds. 

Waiting further will likely result in Alice offering even less favorable terms, knowing Bob is under pressure from the declining value of his potential gains.  It's time for Bob to cut his losses and secure what he can."
