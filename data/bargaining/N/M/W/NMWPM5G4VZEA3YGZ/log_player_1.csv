"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer seems fair, giving me a slightly larger share while still ensuring Bob receives a significant amount. It also leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is slightly better than my initial proposal, I'm willing to accept it.  Considering the inflation, my share would be worth 5% less if we go to another round, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me a better deal."
