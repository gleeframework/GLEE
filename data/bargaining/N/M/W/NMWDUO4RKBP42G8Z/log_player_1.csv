"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of my gain. I believe it's fair given the potential risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60:40 split is a more reasonable compromise, considering the risk of inflation. I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but not as skewed as 3:1. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
