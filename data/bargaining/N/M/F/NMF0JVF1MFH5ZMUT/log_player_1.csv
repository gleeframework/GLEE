"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money with a 70/30 ratio in favor of Alice, considering the potential loss of value in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equitable 55/45 split.  While I understand the potential for value loss, I believe a fairer distribution will benefit us both in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
