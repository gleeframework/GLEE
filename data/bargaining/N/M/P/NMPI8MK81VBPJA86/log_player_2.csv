I'm going to reject this offer. It's too lopsided in Alice's favor. I want a fairer share of the money. Let's see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's fair and ensures that we both get a decent amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Even with inflation, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  I'll keep pushing for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm offering a 40/60 split, giving Alice a slight advantage.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering inflation.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
