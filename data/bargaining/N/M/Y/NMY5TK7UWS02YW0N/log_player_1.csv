"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  I'm hoping this is a good starting point and will entice him to accept.  We both get a significant amount, and I think he will be happy to take the money now rather than risk getting less in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While I understand that inflation is affecting the value of the money,  a 300,000 gain is still significant, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round.  Since the value of Bob's share is decreasing more rapidly than mine, I'm hoping to exploit this disparity and secure a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I propose that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I'm increasing my share slightly from the first round, but I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation that has occurred. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and avoid the risk of getting less in the next round due to continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. Although inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I realize that Bob has been steadily increasing his share each round.  With the value of his share decreasing more rapidly than mine, I'm unlikely to get a better deal in the next round.  Therefore, I'm willing to accept this offer and secure a significant amount of money."
