**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are slowly getting more reasonable.  We're past the halfway point, but Bob is in a strong position due to the inflation not affecting him. Holding out a bit longer could lead to a much better deal."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5050, ""alice_gain"": 4950, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it - my final offer. It's a very slight edge for me, but with inflation eroding your gains every round, you're better off taking this deal now and ensuring we both benefit.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to apply some real pressure and make Alice realize the situation's urgency. This offer is slightly in Bob's favor, but it's presented as a final, take-it-or-leave-it deal.  The clear message about the dwindling value of her potential earnings due to inflation should be a strong motivator for Alice to accept."
