"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain of $4500 is equivalent to $5000 in the first round. Similarly, Bob's gain of $5500 is equivalent to $5833 in the first round.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up $5000 in the first round and only getting $4500 now. However, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
