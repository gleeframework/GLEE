"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair starting point, let's see if you can do better!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is a fairer starting point, given that the value of the money decreases for you in each round. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 51/49 split is fair, especially since the value of my share is decreasing with each round. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split considering the decreasing value of my share.""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%."
