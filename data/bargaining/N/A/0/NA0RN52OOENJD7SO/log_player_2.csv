"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split to start us off. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to propose a different split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split. It's more than fair considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\nI've made my offer. Now it's Alice's turn!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it - but the pot is shrinking for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll take the 50/50 split. The inflation is eating away at the value, and I don't think I can get a better deal in the next round."
