"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each. This is a good starting point, and we can always adjust in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing, let's try to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the current value of the money. Bob's offer gives him $6,000, which is 20% more than my initial offer. However, I'm only getting $4,000, which is 20% less than my initial offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but not too much. Let's try to find a sweet spot!""}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a slight advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still a bit too high, I'm willing to meet you halfway! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a good one. Since his money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, his $5,500 is equivalent to $7,600 in the first round. This is a significant increase from his previous offer.

On the other hand, I'm still getting $4,500, which is a decent amount. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's a good compromise.
