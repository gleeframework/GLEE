"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and take this deal, Bob. Otherwise, the money will be worth less. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be fair, but your last offer wasn't equitable.  This offer is better for both of us in the long run.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the best you're going to get. Take it before inflation eats away at the value even more! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning: While not ideal, this offer is better than what I offered Alice in Round 2, and the money's value is decreasing rapidly. It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a worse deal later.
