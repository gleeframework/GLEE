"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split close to 50/50, but I get slightly more since your money will be worth less next round if we don't make a deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it. I know my money will be worth less next round, but I can still gain more by making a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""I think it's fair that we split the money as close to 50/50 as possible. Since my money is worth less next round, I'm offering you a slightly smaller portion.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's my turn to propose, and the value of your money has decreased again. I'm offering a split that's still close to 50/50, but slightly in my favor to reflect this. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I still believe I could potentially get a better deal, the inflation is really starting to hurt. Accepting this offer will at least guarantee me a decent amount of money."
