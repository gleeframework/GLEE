Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Both our potential gains are shrinking each round. It's in my best interest to secure a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Fairness with a Tilt:** I'm offering a slight majority to myself, acknowledging that Alice loses value at a faster rate than I do. This offer is a good balance between enticing her and maximizing my potential gain. 
* **Urgency:** The message aims to nudge Alice towards accepting. Delaying only hurts us both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is costing me more, I need a bit more to make up for it. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice is trying to capitalize on the inflation disparity, and her offer is getting progressively worse for me. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the initial value.
* **Leverage:**  The longer this goes on, the more desperate Alice will become. Her losses are accelerating faster than mine, giving me an advantage in the negotiation. 
* **Calculated Risk:** While waiting further does diminish the overall value, I'm betting that I can secure a better deal than this in the next round, even with the reduced worth."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be real, Alice. This is going nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamics:**  While I rejected Alice's previous offer, the decreasing value is becoming a significant concern. It's time to signal I'm willing to compromise but not be taken advantage of. 
* **50/50 as Leverage:**  Offering an even split now seems generous considering the circumstances. It puts pressure on Alice, making her rejection seem unreasonable and potentially pushing her to accept before the value drops further.
* **Direct Communication:**  The message is straightforward. I'm acknowledging the stalemate and presenting the 50/50 split as the most logical solution.  This avoids further rounds of potentially fruitless back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is crippling my gains. I need a substantial amount to make up for it. 
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Critical Point:** The inflation has eaten away a significant portion of the potential gains, especially for Alice. While her offer is far from ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for a better deal.
* **Potential Losses Outweigh Gains:**  Rejecting this offer and hoping for a slightly better one in the next round is a gamble with diminishing returns. The value decrease is substantial, and waiting might result in a worse outcome than accepting this offer.
* **Cutting Losses:** Sometimes the best negotiation strategy is knowing when to fold. While I started strong, the inflation dynamic puts me at a disadvantage the longer the game continues. Accepting this offer secures me a portion of the money, even though it's less than initially hoped for."
