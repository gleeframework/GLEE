Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit without risking further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I could try for a slightly better deal in the next round, accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a reasonable amount and avoids further losses due to inflation. It's a fair deal under the circumstances."
