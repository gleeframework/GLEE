"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is 50/50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I accept the offer.
