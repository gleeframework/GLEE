"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise and give him a decent amount, but still keeping the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's my turn to make a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get the majority of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to give up 90% of the money, even though it's worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer this time. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $360,000 and keeping $640,000 for myself, trying to find a more balanced and reasonable compromise."
