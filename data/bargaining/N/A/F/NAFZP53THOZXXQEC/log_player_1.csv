I'll start by taking the lion's share, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to get the ball rolling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Let's split it evenly. Inflation is starting to take a toll, and it's better to secure half now than risk losing more in the next round."
