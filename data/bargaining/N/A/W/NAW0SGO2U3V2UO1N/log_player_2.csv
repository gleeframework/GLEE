Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was already generous considering the inflation. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45? It's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
