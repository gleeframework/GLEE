"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away everything. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth 20% less now, $3,000 is equivalent to $4,000 in the first round, which is a decent offer, but I was hoping for a bit more.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, considering the inflation and the previous offers.

Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the decreased value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 42% of the original $10,000, which is $4,200, and leaving $5,800 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to give up too much, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, $4,500 is equivalent to $8,900 in the first round, which is a relatively good offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll think about it for a moment...
