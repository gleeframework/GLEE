"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I take the lion's share, but you get a nice chunk to begin with.  Accept, and we'll both get richer as the game goes on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's not in my best interest to accept it. It's only the first round, and I can potentially get a better deal if I reject and propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
