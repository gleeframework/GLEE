"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the original amount, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are now:

* Alice's share: $900,000 x 0.8 = $720,000
* Bob's share: $100,000 x 0.9 = $90,000

Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: $500,000
* Bob gain: $500,000

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. My current share would be $720,000, and I think I can do better than that.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the current value, which is $400,000, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the current values:

* Original $1,000,000 x 0.8 x 0.8 = $512,000 (Alice's gain in round 2) x 0.8 = $409,600
* Original $1,000,000 x 0.9 x 0.9 = $810,000 (Bob's gain in round 2) x 0.9 = $729,000

Now, Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: $450,000
* Bob gain: $550,000

Considering the current values, Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: $450,000 / $409,600 ≈ 1.10
* Bob gain: $550,000 / $729,000 ≈ 0.75

I'll reject this offer because it's not favorable to me. My current share would be $409,600, and this offer is worse than that.

I'm offering Bob 46% of the current value, which is $460,000, and keeping 54% for myself, which is $540,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the current values:

* Original $1,000,000 x 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 = $409,600 x 0.8 = $327,680
* Original $1,000,000 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 = $729,000 x 0.9 = $657,300

Now, Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: $520,000
* Bob gain: $480,000

Considering the current values, Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: $520,000 / $327,680 ≈ 1.59
* Bob gain: $480,000 / $657,300 ≈ 0.73
