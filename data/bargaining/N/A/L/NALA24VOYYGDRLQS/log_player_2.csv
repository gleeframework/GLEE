Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a tiny bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  The longer this goes on, the less any offer is worth to me due to the inflation. Accepting 43 is better than risking an even worse offer in the next round, or even walking away with nothing."
