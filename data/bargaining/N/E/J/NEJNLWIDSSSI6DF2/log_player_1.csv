"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my share as 40% of the original $100, which is $40. But since the money is worth 20% less, I'll actually get $32.

However, Bob's offer is for me to get $40, which is actually $32 in terms of purchasing power due to inflation. So, I'll accept this offer.
