"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. I believe it's a fair deal considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it seems like a fair deal now, the money will be worth less in future rounds for Alice. I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we should split the money 60/40 in my favor. It's a fair deal, considering the value of the money is decreasing faster for Alice than for me. Let's finish this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This factors in the inflation but is still a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred my initial proposal, I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is becoming a significant factor, and it's better to secure a deal than risk losing more money in the next round."
