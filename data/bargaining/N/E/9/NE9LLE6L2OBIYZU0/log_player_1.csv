"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost all of the money, leaving Bob with just $1. I know it's a bit greedy, but I want to see how he reacts and if he's willing to risk losing more money in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer to have more, I'm not sure I can get a better deal. With each round, the money is worth less, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
