"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""This is a fair split, Alice. Let's call it a day.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I would have preferred my own offer, I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation. It's better to take what I can get."
