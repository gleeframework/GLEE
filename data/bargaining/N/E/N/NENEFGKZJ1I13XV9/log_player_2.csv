"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can do better than a 50/50 split!  I'll make a counter-offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself, as we're both losing money with each round. I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a bit more, Bob, but let's be reasonable. I'm willing to go up to 48, but I'm not giving you more than that. We need to get this done before inflation eats away too much. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation.  Let's accept and avoid losing more money!"
