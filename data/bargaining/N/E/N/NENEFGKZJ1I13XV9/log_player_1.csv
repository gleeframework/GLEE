Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself, as we're both losing money with each round. I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
