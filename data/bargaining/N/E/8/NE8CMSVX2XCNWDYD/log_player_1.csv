"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation hits you harder. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. My offer is fair considering the inflation. This is your chance to secure a decent amount.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I think this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. While his offer might seem tempting as the value decreases with each round, accepting a deal where I continuously get less is not in my best interest. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means risking getting a smaller amount later."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and be done with it.  I'm losing money with every round we waste!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value with each round, I'm not. It's time for me to take a bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is blatantly exploiting the inflation situation. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the initial value.  While the risk of getting nothing increases as we approach the deadline, accepting such an unfair deal sets a bad precedent and encourages Bob to continue lowballing. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a reasonable share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Let's end this now before we both lose even more. It's still a better deal for you than for me, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's getting dangerously close to the end. While this offer still favors Bob, it's the most reasonable one he's likely to get at this point. By framing it as my final offer and highlighting the risk we both face, I hope to pressure him into accepting.  I'm conceding more than I'd like, but getting something is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think you'll take what you can get at this point. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a tough pill to swallow, but with only four rounds left, and the value decreasing rapidly for me, Bob is likely to push this even further.  Accepting this offer ensures I at least get something, which is better than the increasing likelihood of walking away with nothing."
