"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate the offer. With the 20% reduction in value, the $250,000 I'd gain in this round is equivalent to $200,000 in the first round.

Given the significant difference in the proposed split, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (due to two rounds of 20% inflation), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 700,000$ and keeping 300,000$ for myself, which seems like a reasonable adjustment for the reduced value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think this is the best I can do considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate the offer. With the 48.8% reduction in value, the $100,000 I'd gain in this round is equivalent to $533,333 in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a relatively small amount compared to the original $1,000,000. I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth a mere 51.2% of its original value now (due to four rounds of 20% inflation). I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you the majority of the remaining value. Let's wrap this up!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 800,000$ and keeping 200,000$ for myself, which seems like a reasonable adjustment for the reduced value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
