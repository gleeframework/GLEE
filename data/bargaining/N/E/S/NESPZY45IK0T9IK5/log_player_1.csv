"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and divide the money in a way that we both get a good amount. I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer to divide the $100, where I will receive $60 and Bob will receive $40. I included a message to Bob explaining that this division is fair and we both get a good amount. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n(Note: I'll keep track of the rounds and the decreasing value of the money for me due to inflation.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit unbalanced. Let's split the difference and ensure a more even distribution. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject Bob's offer in Round 2.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the offer is more balanced than my initial proposal, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal, considering the money's value will continue to decrease for me in subsequent rounds. I'll take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a more favorable offer or make a counteroffer that suits me better.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of Round 3.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, I'll keep track of the decreasing value of the money for me due to inflation.)\n\n###\n\nCurrent value of money for me: 80% of the original value (100% - 20% inflation in Round 1 and Round 2).\n\n###\n\nNext round, I'll make sure to consider this decreased value when making or evaluating offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value of money for me, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than initially proposed. Let's meet closer to the middle with 52 for me and 48 for you.""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer to divide the $100, where I will receive $52 and Bob will receive $48. I included a message to Bob explaining that I'm taking into account the decreasing value of money for me due to inflation and willing to compromise.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n(Current value of money for me: 80% of the original value, considering 20% inflation in Round 1 and Round 2.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and we both lose if we don't agree. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I will accept Bob's offer in Round 4.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given the significant decrease in the value of money for me due to inflation (48.8% less than the original value), a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise. If I were to reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the value of the money would decrease even further, making it less likely for me to get a better deal. Bob's message also emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement, as we both lose if we don't agree within the 12-round limit.\n\n###\n\nBy accepting this offer, I'll receive $50, which, although not the best possible outcome, is still a fair share considering the circumstances.\n\n###\n\nGame over! I'm glad we could reach an agreement."
