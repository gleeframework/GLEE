"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, we can negotiate later if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to establish a fair baseline for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think 60/40 is a fair start 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. A 60/40 split is still a bit too skewed in his favor, but it's a slightly better offer than the 50/50 I initially proposed.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to 50/50""
}
```

I'm trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share this time to see if he'll meet me in the middle."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to 50/50, but I'm still holding out for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. The 375,000 I'd get is worth significantly less than the 420,000 I proposed in Round 3, due to the inflation.

However, I don't want to give up on getting closer to a 50/50 split. I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share this time. However, I'm still holding out for a bit more than he's offering."

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. The 350,000 I'd get is worth significantly less than the 450,000 I proposed in Round 5, due to the inflation.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to give up on getting a better deal. I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

}

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. The 325,000 I'd get is worth significantly less than the 475,000 I proposed in Round 7, due to the inflation.

  ""message"": ""Let's just split it 50/50, it's the fairest way""
}
```

I'm going back to my original proposal from Round 1, but with a sense of urgency. With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'm willing to compromise and accept a 50/50 split to get a decent share of the remaining money."
