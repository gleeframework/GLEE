**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer of $40 is the most logical choice at this point.  Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The inflation is severe.  Waiting longer means significantly less money for me, even if I get a slightly better split in a future round.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems determined to get at least $60. He hasn't budged much in his offers, suggesting he's willing to risk it all. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already past the halfway point. The pressure is on, and the risk of getting nothing increases with each passing round.

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but taking $40 now is better than risking getting nothing at all later."
