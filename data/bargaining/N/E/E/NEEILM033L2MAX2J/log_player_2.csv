"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation that is hurting us both.  Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hurting me significantly, and I don't want to risk losing even more. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
