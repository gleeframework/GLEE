"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Take 30, it's a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering we both want to get something.  Let's agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 55 is actually worth 55 * 0.9 = 49.5 dollars.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if 45 is a fair share for me, considering I'm the one who had to make the first offer and got rejected. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my potential gain is now worth 10% less than in the previous round. Considering the reduced value, I'll make a more aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob! Take 40 and let's move on!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better share for myself, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to accept and avoid further negotiations."
