"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully. Since Alice's offer is still a bit closer to her previous offer, and I don't want to risk losing more value, I'll accept this offer.
