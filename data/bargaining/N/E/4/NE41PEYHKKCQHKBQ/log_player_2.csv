Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant. It's worth risking another round to see if we can get closer to a 50/50 split, or at least a deal where I get closer to 40% after inflation is considered."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and split it closer to 65/35. It's the only way we both get something decent. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, this offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  

* **Inflation:** The impact of inflation is becoming very significant. Rejecting this offer and hoping for a better deal in later rounds carries a significant risk that any potential gains will be wiped out by inflation. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice seems fixated on a 65/35 split. Holding out might just frustrate her and lead to worse offers.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a payout, albeit less than initially hoped. 
 
It's a tough call, but sometimes a smaller, guaranteed win is better than risking it all for a potentially larger but much more uncertain reward."
