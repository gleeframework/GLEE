"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer. I want to take almost everything, leaving just $1 for Bob.  While this is unlikely to be accepted, it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, this is a fair offer considering inflation and the risk of Bob rejecting it."
