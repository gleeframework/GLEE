"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I propose 60-40 in my favor.  It's time for a change! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll have to be careful with the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculations.

The offer is 60-40 in Bob's favor, which means I'll get $400,000. However, due to the 20% inflation, the value of the money is now worth 80% of what it was in the previous round. So, in real terms, I'll be getting $320,000.

I'll have to think carefully about this...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (due to two rounds of 20% inflation), I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split to account for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""A 48-52 split is a fair compromise, considering the inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer.  Let's end this before the inflation eats away any more of our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns!

With the 48.8% inflation, the money is now worth a mere 51.2% of its original value. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, but in real terms, it's equivalent to $204,800.

I'm not sure if it's worth accepting, considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money significantly...

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the 51.2% value of the money remaining.

Since the money is worth only 51.2% of its original value, I'll aim for a more significant share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk, let's split it 70-30!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting late, let's make a deal.  I'll give you 450000, and we both get something before we lose more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at our potential gains!

Considering the 67.23% decrease in value, the money is now worth a mere 32.77% of its original value. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but in real terms, it's equivalent to $145,155.

It's a relatively small amount, but it's better than getting nothing. I'll have to weigh the risks and consider whether it's worth accepting...
