"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A slightly better deal for me this round, considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject this offer.  It's not a great start, but I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time, Alice. It's better for both of us than the inflation eating away at our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer still gives you a good chunk, and we both lose if we wait much longer. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something."
