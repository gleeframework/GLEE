"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob is interested in accepting this fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's going to get the most out of this deal. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the significant disparity in the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now. The money is worth less, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself, but still leaving a significant amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small consolation prize, but I'm taking the majority of the pie. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $1000 is now equivalent to a mere $520 in the original terms.

Considering the significant difference in the offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer. However, I'm not thrilled about the small consolation prize, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to give you a decent share, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a higher share for myself, but still leaving a significant amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this offer."
