"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need for haggling""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than 50/50. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider that in my decision.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $500, but still keeping a slight edge, hoping to make Bob think twice before rejecting again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for the risk of rejecting your previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than mine. Considering the risks and the decreasing value of the money, I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with further inflation."
