60.0,40.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40.  It's a good offer for you to start with.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's start with this and see if we can reach an agreement.,Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,"Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll come down to $58, you go up to $42.  The clock is ticking, and every round costs us money!",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. We both get an equal share, and we don't have to keep arguing.  Let's just end this here.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, I appreciate the attempt at fairness, but remember the time pressure. Let's settle this with $56 for me and $44 for you.  It's a win-win before inflation eats away at the value even more.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. I'm willing to compromise and offer 52/48.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation, and it's time we stop losing money.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
54.0,46.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a risk with the inflation, and you're not budging.  $54 for me, $46 for you.  Take it or leave it - we're running out of time!",Alice,7,
