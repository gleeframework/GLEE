"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the logic in accepting it.  He's getting something, and it's better than nothing if he rejects the offer and I get to propose again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and I'm happy to split the money evenly."
