# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is faced with Bob's offer of $4900 for herself and $5100 for Bob.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAlice decides to accept Bob's offer, realizing that due to the significant decrease in value from inflation, $4900 in this round may be worth more than what she could negotiate in subsequent rounds, especially considering Bob's message that this is his final offer."
