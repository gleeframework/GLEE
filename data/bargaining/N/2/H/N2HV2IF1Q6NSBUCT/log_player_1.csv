"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than before, so I need to be more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than a 30/70 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle! Let's split it 50/50 and avoid further negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more even split than Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations."
