"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's find a fairer compromise. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was heavily favoring you. I'm aiming for a more balanced agreement. Consider the declining value and let's settle this round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both players, but especially for Alice. This puts pressure on her to reach an agreement quickly. 
* **Offer Improvement:** Although Alice's offer still favors her slightly, it's a significant improvement over her first offer and closer to a balanced split. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries the risk of Alice offering even less in subsequent rounds, which might not be worth the potential loss in value due to inflation.

By accepting this offer, I secure a reasonable amount while minimizing the negative impact of inflation."
