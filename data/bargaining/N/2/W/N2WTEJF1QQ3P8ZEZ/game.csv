800000.0,200000.0,I propose dividing the money in a 4:1 ratio. This ensures a fair share while also considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I propose a 55:45 split. It's a more even division while still taking into account the devaluation of money for you in later rounds.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
