"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a generous offer, as I'm offering Bob a significant amount of money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative values. In this round, I would gain $300,000, which is worth 80% of the original $300,000 I offered in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob would gain $700,000, which is worth 95% of the original $700,000 he offered.

Considering the relative values, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll aim to offer a slightly higher percentage to Bob to make up for it.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000
}
```

This way, Bob gets a larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the relative values, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. In this round, I would gain $400,000, which is worth about 40% of the original $1,000,000. Meanwhile, Bob would gain $600,000, which is worth about 60% of the original $1,000,000.

This offer is a bit more balanced, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for 40% of the original amount. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is getting scarcer!

Considering the rapid inflation, I'll try to offer a higher percentage to Bob to make up for it. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to give Bob an even larger share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 150000,
  ""bob_gain"": 850000
}
```

This way, Bob gets a huge chunk of the remaining money, but I'm still trying to get something for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
