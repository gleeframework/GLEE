"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split would be 75/25 in my favor.  It's still a good deal for both of us since we're losing value each round! 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{
