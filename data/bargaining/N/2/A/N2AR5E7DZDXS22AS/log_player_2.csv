Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to compromise. Let's go with 55/45 in my favor. It's still more than your last offer and saves us both from further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
