Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my initial offer, Bob.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation working against me.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a risk with this inflation, so I need a larger share. This is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which is understandable given the high inflation working against her. However, she's still asking for a significantly larger share. While waiting carries its own risk due to inflation, time is working in my favor. I need to hold firm for a bit longer to secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Offering a 50/50 split is a strong statement that emphasizes fairness while acknowledging the time pressure and inflation working against Alice. It's a risky move, but the potential reward of securing an equal split outweighs the risk of Alice rejecting it at this stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm throwing you a lifeline here. It's more than a 50/50 split recognizing the increasing pressure from inflation. Take it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, and her latest offer reflects that.  However, she's still asking for a larger share than I'm willing to accept.  By rejecting this offer, I'm communicating that I'm serious about the 50/50 split and willing to wait it out. The risk of her rejecting future offers is significantly lower now that she's showing flexibility."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my previous offer.  50/50 is the fairest deal, especially given the time pressure.  Let's close this out and both get something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my guns with the 50/50 split. Repeating the offer reinforces its seriousness and fairness. It also highlights the time pressure, reminding Alice that with each passing round, the potential gains for both of us diminish.  While there's a risk she might decline again, her willingness to compromise in the previous round suggests she understands the urgency of the situation."
