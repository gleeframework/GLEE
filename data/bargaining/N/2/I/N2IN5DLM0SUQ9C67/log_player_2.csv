"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 70/30. It's a good deal for you in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's risky to accept such a lopsided split in the first round.  Since the money loses value for Bob, it's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. 50/50 is a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and the value decreases for you. I'll offer 65/35. It's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Alice is still being very unfair, and I have more time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but 45/55 is the best I can do.  We both need to agree soon or we'll lose a lot of money.""}
```"
