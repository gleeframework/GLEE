I'm starting with a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure Bob will be happy to get anything, and it gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
