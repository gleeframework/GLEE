Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5125,
""bob_gain"": 4875,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I would ideally like a slightly better share, Bob is unlikely to offer more.  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for him each round, making my potential future gains less appealing to him. Accepting the 50/50 split now ensures I get a fair share before inflation further erodes the value for Bob, potentially leading to a worse offer in the future."
