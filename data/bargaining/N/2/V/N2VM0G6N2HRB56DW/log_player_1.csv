Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. What do you think, Bob?"

# Alice gain: 45

Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more careful with my proposal.
