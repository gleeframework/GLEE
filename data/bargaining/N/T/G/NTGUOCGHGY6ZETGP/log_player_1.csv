Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, you can have the small share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's split it 2:3, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of $6000 is now worth less than my original share of $8000. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

```

}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's split it 1:1 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of $5000 is now worth significantly less than my original share of $8000. However, splitting it 1:1 seems like a fair compromise, and it's better than continuing to negotiate. I'll accept this offer.
