"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split, favoring myself slightly. I believe it's a fair offer,  considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  My share will be worth less with each passing round, and Bob's offer, while not ideal,  is still better than risking a further decline in my potential gains."
