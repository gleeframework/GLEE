# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

**Reasoning:** Alice is consistently trying to take advantage, and the deal is getting worse with each round due to inflation. I need to hold out for a better offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""The inflation is eating our money! Let's split it fairly and end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm sticking to a 50/50 split. The constantly decreasing value makes it risky to haggle, and a fair deal is better than nothing as we get closer to the deadline."
