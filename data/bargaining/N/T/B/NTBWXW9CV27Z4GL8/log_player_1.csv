"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm giving Bob 10% of the total amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is starting to bite!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive now, taking a slightly larger share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I think I'll accept this one. The money is worth significantly less for me now, and Bob is offering me a decent share. I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less purchasing power.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
