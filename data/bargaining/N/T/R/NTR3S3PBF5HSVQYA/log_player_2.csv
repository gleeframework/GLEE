Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable. This is a more balanced split.  I'm willing to take less, but I need a better offer than the last one. Let's get this done before we lose too much to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still getting the much better end of the deal even with the inflation working against her. I need to hold out for a better offer."
