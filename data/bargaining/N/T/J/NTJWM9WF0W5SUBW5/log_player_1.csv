Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  I'm willing to give you a sizeable share, but my turn comes with a price. This is a generous offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
