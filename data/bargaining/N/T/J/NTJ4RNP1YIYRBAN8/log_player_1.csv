"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being a bit greedy, Alice! I'll give you a chance to think about it. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate!

Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* My gain: $2,000
* Bob's gain: $8,000

I'm not thrilled with the 2-8 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, hoping Bob will accept this 55-45 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about negotiating, Alice. I'll give you a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a stronger push.

Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* My gain: $2,858.80 (approximately, after 27.1% reduction from $3,960)
* Bob's gain: $6,141.20 (approximately, after 27.1% reduction from $8,400)

I'm not thrilled with the 45-55 split, but it's getting closer to what I'd like. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a new offer. Here it is:
