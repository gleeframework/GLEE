"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80 and you get 20. No negotiations needed!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 70 is actually worth 0.95 \* 80 = 76 dollars.

I'll reject this offer since it's still not as good as my original proposal. I'll wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain of 70 is now worth 0.95 \* 76 = 72 dollars.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle. I'll take 60 and you get 40.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much. You're getting close, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of 75 is actually worth 0.8584 \* 80 = 69.432 dollars.

I'll reject this offer since it's still not as good as my original proposal, and I'm not willing to accept a gain of less than 72 dollars.
