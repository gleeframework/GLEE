```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward offer and we can finish the game quickly!"

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I need more for myself to make this deal worthwhile.""
