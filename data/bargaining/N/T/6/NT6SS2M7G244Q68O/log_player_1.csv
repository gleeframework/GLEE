Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's reverse the roles this time. I'm sure you'll find my offer fair, especially given the changing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer. It's time to be reasonable and consider the changing value of the money. Let's not risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage. While his offer might seem tempting as the rounds progress and my potential earnings decrease, accepting it would mean settling for a tiny fraction of the total amount. It's worth the risk to hold out for a better deal, even if it means getting closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's not prolong this.  It's time to meet in the middle and secure a reasonable share of the money before it's worth less. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now mirroring my offers, but with the advantage of inflation working in his favor. Accepting now would mean I cave to his pressure tactics.  I need to hold firm and signal that I'm willing to risk getting closer to the deadline for a fairer share."

Round 7

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical. We're running out of time and the money is losing value. This offer is a fair compromise that allows us both to secure a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is definitely on now, but Bob is still just mirroring my offers from previous rounds while benefiting significantly from the inflation. It's a risky gamble, but I'm hoping he'll start to get nervous as we get closer to the deadline and offer a larger share to guarantee he gets something."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""This is a final offer. Take it or leave it. We both lose if we don't agree now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

  It's now or never. I'm making a significant concession to show Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I'm also drawing a line in the sand. This offer still secures me a majority share while giving Bob a sizable amount that's far better than nothing.  The ""take it or leave it"" language emphasizes the urgency and hopefully pushes Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. We're both risking losing everything if we don't come to an agreement now. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure a fair share of the remaining value. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with only two rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is too high. Bob is clearly not going to budge beyond mirroring my previous offer, and the inflation means my potential share will shrink even further in the next round. Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable amount, even if it's less than what I hoped for at the start."
