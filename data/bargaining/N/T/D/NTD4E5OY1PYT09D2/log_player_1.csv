"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the effective amount I'd get in round 2 is 95% of 600,000, which is 570,000.

Bob's offer is 500,000, which is less than the 570,000 I would get in this round, but I still have to consider the next round.

I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, which means it's 5% less than 95% of 600,000, so the effective amount is 570,000 * 0.95 = 541,500.

My offer for round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective amount I'd get in round 4. The money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means it's 100% - 14.26% = 85.74% of 600,000. So the effective amount is 600,000 * 0.8574 = 515,440.

Bob's offer is 475,000, which is less than the 515,440 I would get in this round.

I'll reject the offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 5, the money is worth 5% less than in round 4, which means it's 5% less than 85.74% of 600,000, so the effective amount is 515,440 * 0.95 = 488,417.60.

My offer for round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
