"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less now, the value of the offer is:

Alice gain: $200,000 / 0.95 = $210,526.32
Bob gain: $800,000 / 0.95 = $842,105.26

I'll accept Bob's offer.
