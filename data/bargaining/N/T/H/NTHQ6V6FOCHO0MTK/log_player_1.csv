"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if you'll accept! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $300,000 and Bob will take $700,000."
