Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. How about a slightly more balanced 55-45 split? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Please let me know the outcome.\n\nMy next offer will be:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I can do 58-42, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll make a decision on Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer, as the inflation is significantly reducing the value of my potential gain, and I don't want to risk losing everything if we can't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds.\n\nPlease let me know the final outcome."
