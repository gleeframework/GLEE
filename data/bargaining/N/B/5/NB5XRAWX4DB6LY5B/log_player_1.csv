"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you get 40. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

This offer is a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but it's still closer to an even split than your offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed towards his favor, especially since I'm already losing value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

I reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a slightly smaller share this time. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

This offer is a 52-48 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value of the money."
