"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a generous offer considering the inflation will hit Bob much harder than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher share, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice. The inflation will continue to hurt Bob more, making it less likely he'll offer anything better in the future. I gain a significant amount, and accepting avoids the risk of getting nothing at all."
