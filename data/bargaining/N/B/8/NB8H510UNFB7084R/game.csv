6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and split the money. This offer is a good deal for you in the long run.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I'll give you a bit less, but it's still better for you to accept now rather than lose more value in the next round.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"The value is decreasing, Bob.  Let's settle this now. This is the same deal you offered, but fairer since the value is lower for me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"The value is decreasing for you, but not for me. I'm taking a bit more this time. It's still better for you to accept now rather than lose even more value.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The longer this goes on, the more we both lose.  Let's split it evenly and end this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I'm taking more this time. Your share is worth less and less, and I'm not affected by inflation. It's time for you to accept what you can still get.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, this is the final offer.  Take it or leave it.  I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of.  A 55/45 split is more than generous considering the circumstances.",Alice,7,
