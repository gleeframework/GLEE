"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still better for you to accept now rather than lose more value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""The value is decreasing, Bob.  Let's settle this now. This is the same deal you offered, but fairer since the value is lower for me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing for you, but not for me. I'm taking a bit more this time. It's still better for you to accept now rather than lose even more value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer of $4,000 is tempting due to the decreasing value, accepting it sets a bad precedent and allows Bob to continue pushing for a larger share.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The longer this goes on, the more we both lose.  Let's split it evenly and end this.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking more this time. Your share is worth less and less, and I'm not affected by inflation. It's time for you to accept what you can still get. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is getting frustrating, but I can't accept such an unfair deal. Bob is clearly taking advantage of the situation. While my position weakens with each round, accepting $3,500 would mean Bob gets a much larger share simply by stalling. I'm hoping he'll see reason and negotiate fairly, otherwise, I might need to drastically lower my expectations soon."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Bob, this is the final offer.  Take it or leave it.  I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of.  A 55/45 split is more than generous considering the circumstances.""}"
