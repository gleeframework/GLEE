Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, 56.5-43.5 is my new offer. You're losing value every round

# Alice gain: 565000

```

It's painful, but at this point, the inflation is eating away at Bob's potential gains. Taking the 43.5% now is better than risking getting even less in subsequent rounds.
