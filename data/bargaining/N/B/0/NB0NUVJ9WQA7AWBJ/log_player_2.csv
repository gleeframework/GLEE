"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know it's important to divide this quickly with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try and see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not sure how quickly the inflation is going to hit, so I'll take a risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it more evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  It's not ideal, but the risk of getting nothing at all is too high now."
