"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 42

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I need a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer, clearly banking on Bob caving to the pressure of inflation. While time is a factor, accepting a deal significantly worse than a 50/50 split isn't in Bob's best interest yet. There's still room to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but I need you to meet me halfway. This offer considers the time constraint and is a fair compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being reasonable, the inflation is affecting you, not me 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the inflation as leverage and not budging much on her offer.  While the pressure is mounting, accepting a deal where Bob gets 44% after 7 rounds is not a good outcome. Bob needs to hold firm and show Alice he's serious about getting a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation while still giving you a slight advantage. Let's settle this now and avoid getting nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a good deal, I'm being generous considering the situation 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is really on now. While not ideal, accepting 45% now is better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds if Alice refuses to budge. It's a tough pill to swallow, but the alternative is likely worse at this point."
