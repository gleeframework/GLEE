"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can work together!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the total, and I'll take $60, which is 60% of the total. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $50 is now worth 90% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $45.

I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle, as it seems like we're both getting a relatively equal share. However, it's a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with further reduced gains.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
