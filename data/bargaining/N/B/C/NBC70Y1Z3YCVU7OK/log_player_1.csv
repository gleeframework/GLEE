"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm proposing a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor.  While this seems like a lot of money for Bob, it's important to remember that the money is losing value with each round.  I'm hoping this offer is enough for Bob to accept, as I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While this is a significant amount of money, it's still less than what I was aiming for in the first round. I know the money is losing value, but I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round if I reject this offer. I'm willing to take the risk to try and get closer to my desired split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm proposing a 800,000 - 200,000 split. This is a slight concession from my initial offer but still reflects a good share for me.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I want to make sure I secure a substantial amount before it erodes further.  I'm hoping that after rejecting my previous offer, Bob will be more willing to negotiate and accept something closer to a 4:1 ratio."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

The inflation is really starting to hurt now, and it's clear that Bob is willing to play hardball. This offer is significantly lower than what I was hoping for, but it's still a substantial amount of money. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant payout, and if I reject it, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the next round.  It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
