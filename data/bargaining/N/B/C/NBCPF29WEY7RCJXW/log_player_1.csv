Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

Round 2

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are:

* Alice's gain: $5000 (down from $8000)
* Bob's gain: $4000 (down from $2000)

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with splitting it evenly, especially since Bob's gain is still worth more than mine due to the 20% inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate a bit more.
