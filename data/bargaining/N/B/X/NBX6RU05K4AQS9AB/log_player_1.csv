"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, the effective amounts are:

Alice gain: $4,000 x 0.95 (95% of original value) = $3,800
Bob gain: $6,000 x 0.8 (80% of original value) = $4,800

I'll reject Bob's offer since I'd rather have a slightly higher share, considering the decreased value of money due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again!

Considering the increased inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you all the money.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is even less favorable than before!

Let's calculate the effective amounts considering the inflation:

Alice gain: $3,000 x 0.857 (85.7% of original value) = $2,571
Bob gain: $7,000 x 0.516 (51.6% of original value) = $3,612

I'll reject Bob's offer since I'd rather have a higher share, even if it means going into the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again!

Considering the increasing inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to balance the odds, but I'm still not giving you all the money.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting desperate, huh?

Let's calculate the effective amounts considering the inflation:

Alice gain: $2,000 x 0.777 (77.7% of original value) = $1,554
Bob gain: $8,000 x 0.323 (32.3% of original value) = $2,584

I'll reject Bob's offer since I'd rather have a higher share, even if it means going into the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again!

Considering the extremely high inflation, I'll aim to get as much as possible to compensate for the rapidly decreasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to salvage what's left, but I'm not going to give you the majority.""
