"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I now have to consider the decreased value of the money. My gain of 400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is 360,000, and Bob's gain of 600,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is 570,000.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and his subsequent offer, I'll try to make a more advantageous offer. I'll aim for a higher share of the money, considering the inflation.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 70/30 split, hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 700,000 in round 3 is now worth 52.9% of its original value, which is approximately 369,300. Bob's gain of 300,000 is now worth 86.74% of its original value, which is approximately 259,122.

Considering this, Bob's offer seems more reasonable, but I still have to think about the value of the money. Since my gain is worth less than Bob's gain, I'll decide to accept this offer.
