"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly.  Since there's inflation to consider, I want to secure as much of the money as possible in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than what Bob offered in the first round, it's still not a good deal for me. I know there's inflation to consider, but I'm hoping to get more than 400,000. I'm going to reject this offer and see what Bob offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 550,000, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I still need to secure a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take the lion's share. I'm not convinced this is a good deal for me, especially considering how much inflation has already eroded my potential gains.  I'm going to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm raising my offer again, hoping to find a compromise that will be more appealing to Bob. With inflation hitting harder each round, I need to get this deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one! Bob's offer is slightly better than what I offered in the last round, but it's still not ideal given how much inflation has affected my potential gains.  However, we're running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'm going to accept this offer."
