I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer, hoping Bob will accept it for a quick win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is just as lopsided as mine.  It's a fair bet he'll reject my offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer, and it seems likely that Bob will accept it to avoid risking getting nothing."
