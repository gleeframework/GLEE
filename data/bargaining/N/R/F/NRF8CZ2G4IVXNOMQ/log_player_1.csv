Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with a 10/90 split, especially since my money is worth less now. I'll take my chances with the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'll try a slightly more even split, but still favoring myself due to the inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous. Bob's offer is even worse, and my money is worth much less now. I'll keep trying to negotiate a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm getting desperate, but I still need to get a decent share.  I'll lower my demand again, hoping Bob sees that we're running out of time."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not going to settle for a 30/70 split. My money is worth much less than it was in the first round, and Bob is taking advantage of the situation. I'm hoping he'll eventually see that we both need to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm going to try one last time to get a decent split. I'm lowering my share again, hoping Bob will finally agree to something reasonable.  We're both losing money with each passing round."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still not fair, and my money is worth a lot less now. I'm not going to give in just yet, but I'm starting to worry about running out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm running out of time and options. I need to compromise, but I won't settle for a completely unfair deal. A 50/50 split is the best I can offer at this point, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree."
