I'm going to offer Alice a much smaller share this time, hoping she'll accept and we can end the game.  It's a risky move, but I think it's worth it to try and maximize my share."

Alice is getting greedy! I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  It's clear that the inflation is affecting her more than it is me, so I'm in a good position to negotiate."

Alice's offer is getting better, but I'm still holding out for a bigger share. The inflation is definitely hurting her more, so I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm mirroring Alice's last offer, but this time I'm hoping she'll accept and we can finally divide the money. The inflation is working in my favor, and I don't want to risk going further into the rounds and losing even more of my share."

Alice is getting closer to my ideal share, but I still think I can get a bit more. I'm sticking to my strategy of waiting for the inflation to force her to accept a more favorable deal for me."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

I'm mirroring Alice's offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure.  We're getting close to the end of the game and I don't want to risk getting nothing. This is my last chance to offer a fair compromise before I might be forced to accept a much worse deal."

This is a good deal for me, and we're running out of time. I'm willing to split the money evenly with Alice to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
