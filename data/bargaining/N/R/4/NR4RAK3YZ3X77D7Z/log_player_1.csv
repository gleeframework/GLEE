Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty aggressive split, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%. This is to see if he's willing to accept a low share early on, or if he wants to risk seeing the money shrink over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and the money is already shrinking. I'd rather take half now than risk getting even less later."
