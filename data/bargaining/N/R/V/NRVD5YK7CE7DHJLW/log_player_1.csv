"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move from Bob! Given that the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a 60-40 split just yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to give Bob a 60-40 split just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share to move things forward 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is starting to bite! Bob's offer is getting more favorable to him as time goes on. Considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob, I'll think carefully about this proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a 70-30 split, especially considering the money is worth 27.1% less for him now. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a fair middle ground, Bob. Can we meet closer to 50-50?""
}
```

I'm trying to get closer to an even split, but I'm still not willing to give Bob a larger share than me."
