"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, and keeping 80% for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we can discuss further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair start, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiating with you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is now worth 90% of the original amount, so it's actually $36.

I'm not impressed with Bob's counteroffer, considering I was already generous in the first round. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer should be even more aggressive to account for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Time for a compromise. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more even distribution than my initial offer, but still takes into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too cautious, I'm willing to take a risk to get more. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $30 is now worth 72.9% of the original amount, so it's actually $21.87.

I'm not impressed with Bob's aggressive offer, considering the decreasing value of money. I think I can still do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer should be even more aggressive to account for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing hard, but I'm not backing down. Meet me somewhere in between?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which is a compromise between my previous offers, but still takes into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
