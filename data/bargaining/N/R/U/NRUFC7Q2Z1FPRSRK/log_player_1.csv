"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to consider that in my decision. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4,000, which is worth 80% of the original $5,000 I would have gotten in the first round.

I'll also consider that Bob's offer is slightly better than my original proposal, and he's giving me a smaller share.

After weighing the options, I'll make my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving away too much""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob a larger share of the $10,000. I'm still trying to negotiate a fair deal, but I'm not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reassess Bob's offer. If I accept, I'll get $3,500, which is worth 64% of the original $5,000 I would have gotten in the first round.

I'll also consider that Bob's offer is slightly smaller than my previous proposal, but he's still giving me a smaller share.

After recalculating, I'll make my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, giving Bob a slightly larger share of the $10,000. I'm still trying to negotiate a fair deal, but I'm not willing to give away too much."
