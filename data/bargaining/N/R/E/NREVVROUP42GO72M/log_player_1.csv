Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a larger piece. This is a compromise for us to end this before inflation eats away at the value even further. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer my previous offer, Bob's offer in Round 4 is now barely better than what he would get if he waited for the next round and proposed to keep it all for himself (due to the 5% per round devaluation for him). There's a significant risk he'll do just that in Round 5, leaving me with nothing. It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a much worse outcome later."
