Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and reasonable!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6000, which is 60%.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself this time.  Let's settle this quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less in this round, I'll keep that in mind when considering Bob's offer. After careful thought, I've decided to reject Bob's offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for himself. I still believe I can negotiate a better deal, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's my turn again! Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

I'll offer Bob $5250 and take $4750 for myself. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 4750, ""bob_gain"": 5250, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground!""}\n\n###\n\nI've included a message to Bob, suggesting that we should find a mutually acceptable agreement considering the impact of inflation on our potential gains.
