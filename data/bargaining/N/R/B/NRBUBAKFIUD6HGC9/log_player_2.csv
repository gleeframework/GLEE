"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we both want a larger share.  I'm sticking with my 60/40 offer for now, as the inflation is impacting you more with each round.  Let's be reasonable and avoid losing more money. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. Inflation is eating into the value, and this back and forth isn't benefiting either of us. I propose a 50/50 split - a fair and simple solution to avoid further losses.""}
