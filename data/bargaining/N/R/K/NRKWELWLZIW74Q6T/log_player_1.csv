"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40% of its original value now. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm offering a slightly skewed split in my favor, but still a reasonable offer considering the reduced value of the money."
