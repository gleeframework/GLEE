"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself. I've attached a message to try to convince Bob that this is a fair split. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your previous offer wasn't fair to me. Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less in this round, Bob's offer of an even split isn't as appealing to me. I think I can get a better deal if I reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll make a new proposal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less in the second round, and another 20% less in this round). I need to take this into account when making my new proposal.\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob a bit more than last time to try to entice him to accept my offer, but not so much that I lose out too much. Let's say I'll offer him 55 dollars this time.\n\n###\n\nHere's my proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more this time. Let's split it 45-55 and be done with it!""}\n\n###\n\nI've attached a message to try to convince Bob that this is a good deal for both of us. Fingers crossed he'll accept!"
