Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I understand you want a slightly larger share, but considering the inflation, this offer ensures we both benefit. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
