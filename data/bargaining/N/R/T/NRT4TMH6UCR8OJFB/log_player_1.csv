I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $9,000 and Bob $1,000. This is a fair starting point, and allows me to secure a large portion of the money while still giving Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}

I'm offering a 81/19 split this time. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm willing to lower my share slightly, but I still want to maintain a significant advantage. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
``` 

I'm offering a 72.9/27.1 split this time.  While I'm losing more value due to inflation, I still want to secure a large portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers will only decrease his potential gains as well, and he'll be willing to negotiate."

```

I'm offering a 65.61/34.39 split this time. I'm adjusting my offer based on the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon to avoid further losses from inflation."

# Bob gain: 6000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, I believe that I can still secure a larger share of the money if I continue to negotiate.  I'm hoping that Bob will eventually realize that rejecting offers will only lead to both of us getting less."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096}

I'm offering a 59.04/40.96 split. We're getting close to the end of the game, and I'm still hoping to secure a decent portion of the money.  While inflation is hurting me, I'm not willing to settle for a small share.  This offer is a compromise, but I hope Bob will see it as a fair way to split the remaining money."
