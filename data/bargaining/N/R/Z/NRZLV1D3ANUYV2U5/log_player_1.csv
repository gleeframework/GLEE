"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% * 90% = 81%), I'll aim for a slightly better deal this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
