"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. My gain of 300,000 is equivalent to 300,000 / 0.95 = 315,789 in the original amount, which is less than my original offer of 600,000.

However, Bob's gain of 700,000 is worth the same as in the first round, which is a significant amount. Considering the inflation, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the previous offers and the inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer takes into account the fact that my gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, and I'm aiming for a slightly lower amount than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

Let's calculate the equivalent value of my gain in the first round: 200,000 / 0.854 (1 - 0.145, which is 14.26% of 1) = 234,111.

Considering this, I'm not thrilled about the offer. My gain is significantly lower than my previous offers, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the increasing inflation. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a relatively equal division. However, considering the inflation, I'm actually offering Bob a slightly higher share than he proposed in the previous round."
