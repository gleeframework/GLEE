Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

""message"": ""This is getting tiresome, Bob.  You're just trying to repackage the previous offer.  I'm willing to be fair, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to wear me down with slightly adjusted offers. By firmly rejecting this and calling out his tactic, I hope to signal that I'm serious about a more equitable split and won't be swayed by small concessions. The clock (and inflation) is ticking, so putting pressure on Bob is important."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. We're both losing money with every passing round. I'm proposing a 51/49 split. It's a slight edge for me, but closer to a fair outcome. Take it or let's stop wasting time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value decreases significantly. It's crucial to convey a sense of urgency.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 51/49 is a small step back from 52/48, signaling a willingness to negotiate but also firmness.
* **Direct Language:** The message is straightforward, aiming to cut through any further attempts at manipulation and push for a resolution."
