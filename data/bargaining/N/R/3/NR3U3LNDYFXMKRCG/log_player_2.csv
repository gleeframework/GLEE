Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slight advantage this time, but let's keep it close.  I'll take 55%, and you can have 45%.  It's a fair compromise, and we can avoid any further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Here's why accepting is the right move for Bob:

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both players. It's in Bob's best interest to secure a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Favorable Offer:** While Alice gets slightly more, the difference is not significant considering the inflation rate. Accepting now guarantees Bob a decent share before it depreciates further.
* **Risk of Future Rounds:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might even propose a less favorable split, putting Bob in a weaker position."
