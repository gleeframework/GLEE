Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure that with the inflation risk, it's better to secure a larger chunk of the money now.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 600,000 now than risk losing more with further rounds of inflation."
