"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate for more if you want.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the initial amount, and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fair split, but I think I deserve a slight edge. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $700,000 in the first round is now worth $560,000, and Bob's gain of $300,000 is now worth $240,000.

Considering Bob's offer in this round, I'll accept it since it's a 50-50 split, which is a better offer than my initial one. However, I'll try to negotiate further in the next round.
