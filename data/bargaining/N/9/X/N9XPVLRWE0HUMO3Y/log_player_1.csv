"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100 and leave 20% for Bob. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, considering the inflation.  Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather have a bit more money now than less in the future. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take your offer. 45 is a good compromise, and I'm glad we could agree on a fair split.""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer and we can end the game!"
