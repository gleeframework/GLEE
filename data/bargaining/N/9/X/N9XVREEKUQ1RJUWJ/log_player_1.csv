""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a good starting point, but the discount rate is significant for both of us. I propose a slightly more balanced split while still acknowledging the faster devaluation you face. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
