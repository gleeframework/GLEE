Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although I am losing a lot more money than Bob due to the inflation, accepting this offer is the best strategy. 
If I reject it, I'll have to make an offer in the next round.  However, my offer will be worth even less due to inflation, and Bob will likely reject it. 
Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most rational choice."
