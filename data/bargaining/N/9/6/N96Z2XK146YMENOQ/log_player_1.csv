"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 90% this time, leaving you 10%.  It's your turn to decide if this is fair. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not too thrilled about leaving with only 10% of the original amount, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, the actual amount I'll get is $100,000 / 0.9 = $111,111.11, which is still a significant reduction from the original offer.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

For now, I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 90% and I rejected it, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to myself. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still willing to compromise!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original amount, which is a bit more than my initial 50/50 offer, but still leaves Bob with a significant share. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than last time, but I still need the lion's share.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, another rejection!

Bob's offer in round 4 is even more one-sided than before, and the money is worth 27.1% less for me due to inflation. Let's calculate the actual amount I'd get:

$50,000 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273 inflation) = $68,714.38

That's a very small fraction of the original amount. I'm not thrilled about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Since Bob has been pushing for a larger share, I'll try to take a bit more for myself. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a stand, Bob! I'm willing to take the majority, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more extreme, with me taking 70% of the original amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but be aware that inflation will continue to eat away at your share. 
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting desperate, and I can see why! With inflation eating away at my share, I need to think carefully about this offer. Let's calculate the actual amount I'd get:

$20,000 / 0.591 (1 - 0.409 inflation) = $33,846.43

That's a tiny fraction of the original amount, and it's clear that Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me.

I'm not going to accept this offer. I think I've been reasonable so far, and I'm not willing to give up that much more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm not going to back down now. Since Bob has been pushing for a very low share for me, I'll make an even more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob. I'm taking what's left. You can either accept or walk away with nothing.""
}
```

This offer is a take-it-or-leave-it deal, with me taking 90% of the original amount and Bob getting a paltry 10%. I'm not sure Bob will accept this, but I'm willing to see how he reacts."
