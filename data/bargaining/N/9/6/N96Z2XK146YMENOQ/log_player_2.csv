Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm not happy with the deal, it's better to take something than nothing.  Alice's share is worth significantly less due to inflation, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer.  Time to take the win."
