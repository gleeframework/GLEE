"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split of 50/50. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nSince the offer is a fair split of 50/50, I see no reason to reject it. It's a reasonable and equitable division of the $100. Accepting this offer ensures that both Alice and I receive an equal share without the need for further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a less favorable outcome for one or both of us."
