Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, 60/40 is still quite generous 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. 45/55 split,  let's end this before inflation eats away at our gains.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're worried about inflation, I'm not. 65/35 is my new offer 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, it's better to take the 35 than risk getting nothing in the next round."
