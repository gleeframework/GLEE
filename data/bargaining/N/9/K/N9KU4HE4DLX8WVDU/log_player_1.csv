Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We need to settle this now. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting any longer will result in a significantly smaller payout, even if we could negotiate a slightly better split.
* **Risk of Losing Everything:**  Holding out for a better offer carries the significant risk of walking away with nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 
* **Fairness:** Bob is unlikely to accept anything less than a 50/50 split now.  Delaying might only result in animosity and a less favorable outcome in the long run."
