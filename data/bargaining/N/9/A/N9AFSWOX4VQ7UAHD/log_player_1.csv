"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm inviting Bob to make a counteroffer or accept this proposal."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I deserve a bit more than 40% of the total. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and getting a good deal for myself. Your turn, Bob!"

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
