Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that I receive $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000. I figure this is a fair split, as I am the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
