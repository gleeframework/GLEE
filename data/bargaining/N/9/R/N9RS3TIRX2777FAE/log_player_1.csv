"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is a hint to Bob that this is a fair offer and he should accept it. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob in each subsequent round, he has an incentive to accept this offer rather than risking a worse offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly. I'll take a little less than you offered, but I think this is fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same for me in each round, I don't have an incentive to accept an offer that is worse than my initial proposal. I'll make a new offer in the next round and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 43 dollars and keeping 57 dollars for myself. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is a hint to Bob that this offer is a compromise between our previous proposals, and he should accept it. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob than in the first round (5% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), he has an even stronger incentive to accept this offer rather than risking a worse offer in the next round."
