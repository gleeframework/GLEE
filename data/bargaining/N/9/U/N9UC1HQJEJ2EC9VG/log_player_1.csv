"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory problem. As Alice, I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. While this seems greedy, it's based on the following reasoning:

* **Rationality:**  Bob, if he rejects, knows he has to make a proposal next. He'll also be aware of the inflation factor. He'll realize that if he tries to be greedy, he'll likely lose more as the rounds progress.
* **Risk Aversion:** Most people are risk-averse. Bob might prefer a small gain now rather than risk getting nothing later.

This strategy is not guaranteed to succeed, but it offers a good balance between maximizing my own gain and minimizing the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  My gains are now worth 5% less, making any future rounds riskier.
* **Fairness:**  While I'd prefer more, the 50/50 split is relatively fair. 
* **Risk Aversion:** Rejecting this offer puts me at risk of getting nothing if Bob becomes more aggressive in future rounds.

While I'm not thrilled with the outcome, accepting this offer is the most rational decision considering the circumstances."
