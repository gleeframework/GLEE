Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced by your offers, Bob. Inflation is hurting you, not me. 57-43 is my new proposal.

# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure from inflation is mounting, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of the potential earnings compared to the start. Alice knows time is on her side, so she's likely to keep pushing her advantage.  It's a gamble, but waiting might force her to offer a more reasonable split."

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a straight 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it, but inflation is eating away at this deal with every passing round.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know inflation is hurting you, but I'm not willing to go down to 50-50. My new offer is 56-44. You should consider accepting before the money loses even more value for you. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is correct that inflation is eating into my potential gains, she's still trying to take a significantly larger share.  By rejecting this offer, I'm communicating that I'm willing to risk getting nothing to get a fairer split.  The pressure is now on Alice, as she knows I'm serious about not accepting a heavily skewed deal."
