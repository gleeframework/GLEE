"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a slight advantage over waiting.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong, but Fair:**  A 52/48 split is advantageous for Alice but still offers Bob a significant sum. It sets a tone that Alice wants to win but is open to negotiation.
* **Inflation Factor:**  Waiting too long drastically diminishes the value of the money. It's important to incentivize Bob to settle early.
* **Psychology:** The message is crucial. It appeals to fairness while subtly highlighting the risk of delay. This approach can make Bob more receptive to accepting a deal in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option, and we both get a decent amount. No need to risk losing money in the next round! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting because it seems fair and safe, accepting now would mean Alice settles for less than what she aimed for in Round 1.  Here's why Alice should reject and continue negotiating:

* **Leverage:** Bob's message indicates he's averse to risk and wants to settle quickly. This gives Alice leverage to push for a slightly better deal.
* **Time Pressure:** While there's still time, the 10% inflation rate means every round counts. Alice needs to apply more pressure. 

**It's crucial for Alice to present a counter-offer in Round 3 that balances firmness with the need to avoid a stalemate.**"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but let's be practical. We both lose money every round we wait. I'm proposing a small adjustment - it's a win-win for us to close the deal now."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice acknowledges Bob's desire for a fair split but stands firm on getting slightly more. 
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the time pressure and frames the offer as a way to minimize losses for both parties.
* **Calculated Risk:**  By slightly reducing her initial demand, Alice shows a willingness to compromise, making it more likely Bob will accept and avoid further losses due to inflation."
