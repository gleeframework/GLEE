Alice's offer:

It's a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice a slightly lower share, hoping she'll accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While it's less than I initially hoped for, taking a 50/50 split is better than the risk of further inflation."
