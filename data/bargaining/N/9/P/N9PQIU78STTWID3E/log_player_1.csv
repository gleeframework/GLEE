Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much too early. This is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it is a larger share than before, I'm not sure I trust Bob to keep increasing my share, and I have time to wait and see what happens.  I'm not sure what the inflation rate is for him, so I'll wait and see what he offers next round."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a larger share for Bob,  I'm still hesitant to agree this early.  I'm not sure what the exact inflation rate is, but it seems like it's having a bigger effect on Bob than it is on me.  I'm going to wait and see what he offers in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that we're getting closer to the deadline. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is much too low.  While I recognize that Bob is facing a greater inflation rate, I believe it is still in my best interest to reject.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a more equitable share of the money."

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""We're running out of time, Bob. I'm willing to give you a small share, but we need to make a deal soon. Let's split this fairly before we both lose everything.""}

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that we're running out of time. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still too low, especially considering the significant amount of inflation that Bob is facing.  While time is running out, I believe that I can still get a more equitable share by continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to keep raising my offer in the hopes that Bob will eventually come to his senses."

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give away too much with the deadline looming. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  It's clear that Bob is feeling the pressure of the deadline and the high inflation rate.  However, I believe I can still get a better deal if I hold out just a little longer.  I'm going to make a final offer in the next round that's more equitable and see if he's willing to accept it."

Round 11

{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000, ""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  We're running out of time, and I'm giving you a larger share than in previous rounds.  It's time for us to compromise before we both get nothing.""}

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to make another offer. If we don't make a deal now, we'll both get nothing. I'm willing to take the risk and hope that Alice will come back to the table. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  Even though I'm not getting my ideal share, it's better than getting nothing.  The inflation rate is clearly having a big impact on Bob, and he's likely willing to take the risk of getting nothing rather than accepting a worse deal.  It's time to cut my losses and secure some of the money."
