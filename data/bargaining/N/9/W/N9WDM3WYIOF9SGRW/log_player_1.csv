"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'm willing to give you a good share but I think 55/45 is a better split for us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new values, my gain of $45 is worth 90% of $80, which is $72, and Bob's gain of $55 is worth 95% of $20, which is $19.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as I'd rather have more. I'll reject it and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, my offer should be even more aggressive to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I think 70/30 is a fairer split for me""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
