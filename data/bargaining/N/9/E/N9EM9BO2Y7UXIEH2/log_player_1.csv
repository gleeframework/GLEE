"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm trying to be generous, but also assert my dominance in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in this round, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth $360,000. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is getting worse, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, the value is dropping fast""
}
```"
