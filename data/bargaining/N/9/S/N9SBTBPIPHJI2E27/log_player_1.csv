"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's previous offer was 50/50, I'll try to get a bit more for myself this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
