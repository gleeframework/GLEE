I propose that Alice receives $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering Bob's potential loss is greater with each passing round.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is being greedy, offering me less money than my initial proposal and making me lose more with inflation. I'll reject this offer and see what he proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar split, but offer slightly more to Bob to incentivize him to accept.  Since the money is worth less with each round, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal."
