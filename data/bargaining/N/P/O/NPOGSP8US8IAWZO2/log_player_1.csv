Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'm not sure how the inflation affects Bob, I'll have to make a strategic decision.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth less and less, but I'll try to make a good offer.

  ""alice_gain"": 28.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 71.5
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
