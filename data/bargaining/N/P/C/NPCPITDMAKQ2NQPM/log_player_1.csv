"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for a reasonable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should be more even. Let's split it 60-40 this time, with me getting the larger share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

I don't think Bob is trying to be even, but rather trying to take advantage of the fact that I made the first offer. His proposal is actually a worse deal for me than my original offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in Round 2, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in Round 2.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
