50.0,50.0,Let's split it evenly. Fair game?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I appreciate the offer for an even split, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more reflective of the game's dynamic. With inflation, the value decreases for me over time. This seems fair considering the circumstances, don't you think?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand your perspective on inflation, but I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split.  Let's compromise at 55/45. It's a better deal for you than the previous round, and still gives me a decent share.",Alice,3,
