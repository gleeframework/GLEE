"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game, and inviting Bob to accept or decline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get less than me, think about it 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I now have to consider the value of my potential earnings.

I'm not thrilled with the idea of getting less than Bob, but I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a better deal this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You said I'd get less than you, let's see if I can do better.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 58/42 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but still not there 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings. With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be even more cautious.

Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's still not willing to give me a better deal. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or not.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll try to get an even better deal this time, considering the increasing inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 460000,
  ""bob_gain"": 540000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 46/54 split, trying to get a bit closer to an equal split."
