"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point, and I'm keeping most of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, Alice. Let's get this done before we lose more money! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the offer is less attractive to me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. But I need to keep most of the money to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This way, I'm keeping a larger share, but giving Bob a slightly larger share than in my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're losing money with each round! Let's split it 60/40 and get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now. I'll have to be more drastic in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I'll give you 300,000, but I need to keep most of the money to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This is a tough offer, but I'm trying to get the best deal I can given the rapidly depreciating value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time! Let's split it 65/35 and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly, and I'm getting desperate. I'll have to consider Bob's offer carefully.

I'll accept this offer, as it's the best I can get at this point.
