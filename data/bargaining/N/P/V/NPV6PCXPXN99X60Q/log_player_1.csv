"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! This is a fair offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. It's a 4:1 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly, considering the decreasing value of money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, I'd be getting $600,000, which is a significant decrease from the initial offer. However, I think Bob's proposal is a reasonable one, considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
