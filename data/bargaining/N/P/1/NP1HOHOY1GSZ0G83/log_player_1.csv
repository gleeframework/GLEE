"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, I'll give you a generous offer. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, I'll have to consider whether it's a good deal.

In this round, my gain would be $500,000, which is 50% of the current value of the money. Considering the inflation, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the inflation.

In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'll offer Bob a smaller amount, but still a significant portion of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You could have taken a good deal in the last round, but I'll give you another chance. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. In this round, my gain would be $400,000, which is 40% of the current value of the money.

Considering the inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decision. Bob is offering me a smaller share, but I'm not sure if it's the best option.

However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can get a better deal in the next round.
