"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 40-60 split. The money is worth less to me now, so I'd like a slightly larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a 45-55 split, which I think is a fair compromise given the reduced value of the money."
