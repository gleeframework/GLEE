"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both have to agree. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, the numbers are now:

Alice's gain: 630,000 (10% less than 700,000)
Bob's gain: 600,000 (still the same as before)

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, considering I'm still getting less than him. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again due to inflation, the numbers are now:

Alice's gain: 630,000 (10% less than 630,000)
Bob's gain: 600,000 (still the same as before)

I'll make a new offer, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's offer was not as generous as I had hoped.

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
