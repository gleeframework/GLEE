"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping the remaining $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since I'm worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my valuation. In this round, $1,000,000 is worth $900,000 to me.

Considering the offer, I'll get $100,000, which is still a decent amount, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll play it safe and reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping the remaining $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my wealth!

Considering the offer, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 67.7% of what it was in the first round. It's not a bad deal, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll think carefully and...
