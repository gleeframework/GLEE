Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it quickly to avoid any inflation risks.  I'll be keeping the vast majority of the money, but I'm hoping this will incentivize him to take my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still significantly more favorable to him, and I'm not willing to accept that. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm willing to offer Bob a bit more this time, given that he rejected my previous offer.  This offer still gives me the majority of the money, but hopefully, it's enough to incentivize Bob to accept before inflation kicks in again."
