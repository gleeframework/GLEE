"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less now, I'd rather try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, my offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money."
