Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  Considering the risk of inflation, it's a generous offer. Take it, and we both walk away with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
