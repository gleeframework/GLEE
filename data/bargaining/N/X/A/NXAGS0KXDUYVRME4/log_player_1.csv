"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to keep $99 for myself, and give $1 to Bob. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept the offer in the first round, given that the money will be worth less to him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer more, I know that if I reject this offer, the money will be worth less to me in the next round, and Bob will likely propose an even more unfavorable split."
