Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, I'm proposing that I (Alice) receive $60 and Bob receive $40, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, an even split would actually be unfair to me. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! Here's my next proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split.""}"
