"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a generous 30% of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more fair this time.  I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60.  We can both come out ahead. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so my gain of 40 is actually worth 32. 

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a better deal than what I got in the first round and it's a significant improvement over the original amount.
