Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40, which gives you a larger share and still allows me a decent amount after inflation. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round that passes diminishes the value of the money for Bob. This puts pressure on him to make a deal. 
* **Favorable Split:** While not ideal, a 60/40 split in your favor is significantly better than the 50/50 he offered before and ensures you get a good portion of the money.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for more in the next round risks Bob offering even less, potentially leading to a worse outcome for you. 
 
Accepting now locks in a favorable deal considering the circumstances."
