# Alice gain: 5400

# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the situation with the inflation. This is my final offer, let's close the deal and ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still losing out significantly, the inflation is severely impacting the value of the money I'm receiving. It's better to accept this offer and secure at least some money, than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
