"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, where I get 6,000 and Bob gets 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 45:55 split is a good idea, especially considering that the money is worth less than it was in the first round. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the changing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52:48 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing a 52:48 split, where I get 5,200 and Bob gets 4,800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is hurting both of us, so a 50/50 split seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is reasonable, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it."
