"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000 is now worth 450,000 in real terms. I'm not sure if I want to settle for this offer, considering the initial proposal I made in Round 1 was a 60-40 split. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the fact that the previous offers were 60-40 and 50-50, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 450,000 is now worth around 327,000 in real terms. Considering the previous offers were 60-40, 50-50, and 55-45, and now Bob is offering a 45-55 split, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
