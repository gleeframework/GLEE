Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. This way, I get the biggest chunk of the money before inflation starts to erode its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is almost the exact opposite of mine. He's trying to get the lion's share. I'll reject this and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly downwards, still aiming for a larger share, but acknowledging that Bob might not accept such an extreme imbalance.  Hopefully, this compromise will lead to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the majority of the money, even though the inflation is impacting him more. I'm going to reject this offer again and try to negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering an even split this time. The inflation has started to seriously affect the value of the money, and we need to come to a compromise. A 50/50 split seems the fairest option at this point."
