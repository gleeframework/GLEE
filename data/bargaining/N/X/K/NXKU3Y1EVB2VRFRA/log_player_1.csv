"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less, I need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is closer to an equal split than my initial offer, I'll consider it. However, I still want to get a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll try to get a better deal than Bob's previous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less, I need to reassess the situation. Bob's offer is now closer to an equal split, but I still want to get a better deal.

However, considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll accept this offer, as it's not far from an equal split and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with the money being worth even less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4."
