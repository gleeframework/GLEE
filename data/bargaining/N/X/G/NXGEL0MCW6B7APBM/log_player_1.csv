I propose to keep 9000$ for myself and give 1000$ to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8550, ""bob_gain"": 1450}
``` 
I propose to keep $8,550 for myself and give $1,450 to Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  Since the money is worth 5% less for me each round, I need to keep a larger portion to maintain my original purchasing power.
* **Negotiation:** By offering Bob slightly more than his previous offer, I'm attempting to incentivize him to accept. I'm also  playing the long game, knowing that Bob might be incentivized to accept before the inflation hits him too hard."
