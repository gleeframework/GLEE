"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this over with, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm making a bold opening offer, taking the entire $100 for myself. If Bob accepts, the game is over. If he rejects, it's his turn to make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to be a reasonable guy.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for 50% just yet. I want to try to get more. The money is still worth the same to me, so I'm not worried about inflation affecting my gains. I'll let Bob make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better end of the deal if you think you can just split it down the middle!""
}
```

I'm making a more aggressive offer this time, taking 80% of the money for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better end of the deal? I'll give you less, but still a decent chunk! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get a better deal after my previous offer.

I'll consider his proposal...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with 40% of the money, even if the value of the money is the same for me as in the first round. I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Bob's offer is more generous than his previous one, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm making another aggressive offer, taking 90% of the money for myself. I'm trying to put pressure on Bob to accept a deal that's heavily skewed in my favor. Let's see if he'll bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me much to work with, but I'll take what I can get! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is making a bold move!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Wait, what? I'm actually accepting Bob's offer! With the value of the money decreasing due to inflation, I'm starting to think that getting 20% of the money now is better than risking getting even less in future rounds. Bob's offer is a decent chunk of change, and I'm willing to take it. Let's end the game!"
