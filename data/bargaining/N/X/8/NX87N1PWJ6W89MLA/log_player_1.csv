"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. I believe this is fair considering the decreasing value of money.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the value of the money decreases for me each round. This ensures we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
