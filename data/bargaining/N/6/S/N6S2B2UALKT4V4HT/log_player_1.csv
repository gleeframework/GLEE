Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fairer starting point.  It's still in your favor, but gives me a bit more to work with.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
