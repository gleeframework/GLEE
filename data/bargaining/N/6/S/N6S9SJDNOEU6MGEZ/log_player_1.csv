"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the higher inflation rate Bob will face in future rounds.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking further inflation and potentially ending up with less than this in the next round."
