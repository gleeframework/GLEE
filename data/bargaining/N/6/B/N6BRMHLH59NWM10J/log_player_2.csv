"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. Take this offer and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer, as it seems too lopsided in Alice's favor. I think I can get a better deal in the next few rounds, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal, and we both get something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again.  My last offer was generous, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer. Even though the time is running out, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next few rounds. I think I can hold out for a more equitable split, especially since the inflation is starting to hit."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise a little more. Let's split the money 45/55.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation, and we can both walk away with something.""}
