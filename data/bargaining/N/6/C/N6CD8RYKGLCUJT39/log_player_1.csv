"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","For round 2, I'll have to adjust my calculation considering the 5% decrease in value for me and 10% decrease in value for Bob.

If Bob's offer is accepted, I would receive $30, which is worth 95% of the original $30, so it's actually $28.50.
Bob would receive $70, which is worth 90% of the original $70, so it's actually $63.

For round 1, the original values were $60 for me and $40 for Bob. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I would receive $60 * 0.8547 (1 - 0.1453) = $51.47.
