"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000 each, which is a fair and equal split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round!"
