"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and maximize my share right away, knowing the inflation could hurt me later.  I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll take it to avoid any risk.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer is the best strategy for me. Since the inflation only affects Bob, he's more likely to get a smaller share in the next round.  I'll take the guaranteed half now!"
