{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer is now a 50-50 split, I'll take it. The inflation is affecting me more harshly, so I'll accept this offer to get some money now rather than risking it in future rounds.
