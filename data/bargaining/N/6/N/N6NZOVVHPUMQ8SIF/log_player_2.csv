{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. While it seems fair at the moment, the inflation will drastically impact Alice's share more than mine. I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."

While Alice's offer is closer to what I was proposing, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself considering the significant inflation impact on Alice."

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, I believe we can still find a more balanced solution. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a better offer that reflects the significant impact inflation is having on Alice."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, I've made a significant concession. Meet me halfway. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice is making concessions, it's not enough to make this offer worthwhile for me considering the significant impact inflation is having on her. I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I need to see a slightly higher offer that acknowledges the drastic decline in her share's value."
