"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $6,000. I'm hoping this will be a fair and reasonable starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both have an equal say in this. Let's move forward and finalize this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I now need to consider the proposal more carefully.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think a 55/45 split is not fair, especially considering we both have an equal say in this. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is now worth 40% less than in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55% for me would be a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at 52.5/47.5?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split, which I think is a fair compromise between my initial offer and Bob's previous offer."
