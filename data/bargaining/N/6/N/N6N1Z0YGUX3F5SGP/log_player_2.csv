"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle to get started! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a good starting point, I'm hoping to get a better deal for myself. I want to see if I can negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both have an equal say in this. Let's move forward and finalize this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55% for me would be a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at 52.5/47.5? 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While I'd still prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to bite, and this is a decent compromise. I don't want to risk getting nothing."
