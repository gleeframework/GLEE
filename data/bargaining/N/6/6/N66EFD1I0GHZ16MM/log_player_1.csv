"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer. I want to keep most of the money, but I'm giving Bob a small amount just to see if he'll accept it. I'm hoping he'll think about the inflation and how much worse it might get in the next round."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is getting more greedy, and I don't want to set a precedent of accepting these terms. I think I can still get a better deal for myself.  I'm hoping the inflation will encourage him to be more reasonable in the next round."

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and I'm still not willing to accept such a low share. The inflation might be affecting him more than me, but I believe I can still secure a more favorable deal.

I'm going to stick with my previous offer. I'm not budging much, but I am giving Bob a slightly better deal than my previous offer.  I'm betting he's starting to feel the pressure from the inflation and might be willing to accept this. If not, I'm ready to continue negotiating."

Bob's offer is getting more and more unreasonable, and I'm not going to cave in to his demands. While the inflation is a factor, I still believe I can get a better deal if I stand firm. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us, and I'm not going to settle for something less than what I deserve."

```

Bob is getting more and more demanding.  I'm still not willing to accept this offer, even with the increasing pressure of inflation.

This is the last round, and if I reject this offer, we both get nothing.  While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still reasonable considering the inflation and the fact that it's the final round. It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all."
