"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 70/30 in my favor. I think this is a good starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, I'll take 80 and we can end this 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not too thrilled about the 20$ I'd be getting. But, I don't want to drag the game out either. I'll decide to accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
