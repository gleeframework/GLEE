"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'm not getting a better deal than in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation effect, I'll offer a slightly better deal for myself this time:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... I think there's a mistake! You said the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, but the numbers in Bob's offer don't match that. According to the inflation rate, Bob's gain should be worth significantly less than 55.

Assuming the inflation rate is correct, let's recalculate Bob's offer:

Original Bob's gain: 60
Inflation rate: 48.8%
Bob's gain in round 4: 60 * (1 - 0.488) = 31.2

So, Bob's offer should be around 31.2 for him, not 55.

With that in mind, I'll reevaluate the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was incorrect, I'll aim for a slightly better deal for myself this time:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation rate is getting crazy! Let's calculate Bob's gain in the first round, then apply the inflation rate:

Original Bob's gain: 60
Inflation rate: 67.23%
Bob's gain in round 6: 60 * (1 - 0.6723) = 19.93

So, Bob's offer should be around 19.93 for him, not 70.

With that in mind, I'll reevaluate the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation rate is getting out of control! Considering the drastic decrease in value of the money Bob gains, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the severe inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is getting absurd! Let's calculate Bob's gain in the first round, then apply the inflation rate:

Original Bob's gain: 60
Inflation rate: 79.03%
Bob's gain in round 8: 60 * (1 - 0.7903) = 0.1256

So, Bob's offer should be around 0.1256 for him, not 80.

With that in mind, I'll reevaluate the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation rate is getting ridiculous! Considering the extreme decrease in value of the money Bob gains, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the almost complete devaluation of Bob's gain:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is getting completely out of control! Let's calculate Bob's gain in the first round, then apply the inflation rate:

Original Bob's gain: 60
Inflation rate: 86.58%
Bob's gain in round 10: 60 * (1 - 0.8658) = 0.0084

So, Bob's offer should be around 0.0084 for him, not 90.

With that in mind, I'll reevaluate the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation rate is completely absurd at this point! Considering the almost complete devaluation of the money, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the extremely low value of Bob's gain:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 99.99999999999999,
  ""bob_gain"": 0.00000000000001
}
```

I'm essentially offering Bob a tiny fraction of a cent, while taking almost the entire amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is still completely out of control! Let's calculate Bob's gain in the first round, then apply the inflation rate:

Original Bob's gain: 60
Inflation rate: 91.41%
Bob's gain in round 12: 60 * (1 - 0.9141) = 0.0054

So, Bob's offer should be around 0.0054 for him, not 99.

With that in mind, I'll reevaluate the offer:

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 12.
Round 13
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation rate is still completely absurd! Considering the extremely low value of the money, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the almost complete devaluation of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,

I'm essentially offering Bob nothing, and taking the entire amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 13.

Round 14
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 94.5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is completely implausible! Let's calculate Bob's gain in the first round, then apply the inflation rate:

Original Bob's gain: 60
Inflation rate: 94.5%
Bob's gain in round 14: 60 * (1 - 0.945) = 0.0036

So, Bob's offer should be around 0.0036 for him, not 100.

With that in mind, I'll reevaluate the offer:

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 14.
Round 15
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation rate is getting to a point where it's essentially meaningless. I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the complete devaluation of the money:
