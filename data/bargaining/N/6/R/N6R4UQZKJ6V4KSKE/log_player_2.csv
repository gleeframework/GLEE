"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:2 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's proposal seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Rejecting this offer gives Bob the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round, potentially securing a larger share of the diminishing funds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose we split the money 6:4 in my favor. This reflects the risk of inflation, and hopefully we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose dividing the money 52.5:47.5 in favor of Bob. This aims to balance the risk while ensuring a reasonable gain for both parties. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer, while still slightly favoring her, acknowledges the inflation and provides a reasonable gain for Bob. Accepting this offer secures a portion of the decreasing funds and avoids the risk of further losses due to inflation."
