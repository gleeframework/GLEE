"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering I'll be the one making the offer in the next round. Let's be reasonable and avoid unnecessary delays. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 45 is now worth less than 60 was in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's gain of 55 is worth 55 or 45 in real value, but I'm not going to worry about that for now.

I'm not too excited about the 45/55 split, but I'm willing to accept it to move on to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
