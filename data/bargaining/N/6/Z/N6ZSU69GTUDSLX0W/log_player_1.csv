"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40. Waiting for his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better balance. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The offer isn't good enough for me, especially considering the inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""
}


I'm taking into account the inflation and offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still trying to find a compromise. Waiting for Bob's response!"
