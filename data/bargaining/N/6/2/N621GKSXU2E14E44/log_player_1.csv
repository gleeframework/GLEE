"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money and Bob 10%. This is a very generous offer, but it's important to be aggressive in the first round to establish a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is basically the inverse of my first offer.  While the value of the money has decreased, it's still too early to settle for such a small portion. I'm willing to wait and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 80%, but still keeping a significant majority. Since I'm the one making the offer now, I want to make sure I maintain a strong position while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly worse than my initial offer. While the money has lost value due to inflation, I am still confident that I can get a better deal.  I will continue to hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but still maintaining a large majority.  While the money is losing value quickly, I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we both get a decent share.  I'm willing to concede further, but only if Bob also shows a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, as the money has lost a lot of value. However, the inflation is hurting me more than Bob, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal at this point. It's better to secure at least a decent portion of the remaining money than risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers."
