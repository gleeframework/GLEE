"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This offer gives Alice a larger share, but it's still reasonable and leaves some room for negotiation. We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, it's still a good deal considering the inflation factor.  I'd rather secure a decent gain now than risk a worse offer later."
