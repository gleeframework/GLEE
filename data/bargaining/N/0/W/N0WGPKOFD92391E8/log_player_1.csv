"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to make the next proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, I want 60. It's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to consider that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Since Bob is offering me $40, which is worth the same as in the first round, and he's keeping $60, which is 20% less than the $75 he would have kept in the first round, I think this is a good deal for me.
