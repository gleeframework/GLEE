"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and reasonable division""}

I'm proposing that I get 700,000 and Bob gets 300,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable division, considering we're starting with a large sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more substantial share, especially considering the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's meet in the middle again""}

I'm reducing my demand slightly, but still trying to get a decent share considering the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, finally! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm glad Bob is willing to meet me in the middle! With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'm happy to accept this 50/50 split. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's a fair compromise. I'll take the 500,000 and call it a day."
