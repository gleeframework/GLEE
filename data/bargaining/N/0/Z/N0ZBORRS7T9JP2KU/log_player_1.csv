I'm taking the vast majority of the money, but I'm giving Bob a tiny bit to encourage him to accept the offer.  Let's see how greedy he is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't let him get away with it! I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm offering Bob a slightly larger portion than last time.  I'm hoping this will make him see that I'm willing to negotiate, but that I still want the lion's share."
