"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my potential gain of $5,000 is worth $4,000 in the previous round's dollars, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth $4,750 in the previous round's dollars.

I'll reject this offer since I can do better than a 50-50 split. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,

```

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500."
