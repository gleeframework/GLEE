"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering we both have the chance to make offers. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain would be worth 95% of 45, which is 42.75.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the 10% inflation (5% in each of the two rounds), the $100 is now worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of its original value. I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle this time, let's see if we can agree""
}"
