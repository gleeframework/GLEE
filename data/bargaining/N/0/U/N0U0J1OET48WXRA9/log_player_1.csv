"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the lowball, it's a generous offer! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer because I think it's too biased towards Bob, especially considering the inflation effect. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more skewed split in my favor, but still leaving a substantial amount for Bob. Let's see if he accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of the deal. However, I'm not desperate yet. I'll think carefully about the offer and consider the effects of inflation.

After some consideration, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better. The inflation has reduced the value of the money, but I'm not convinced that this is the best deal I can get. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues! Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money even further, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""My last chance, take it!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more skewed split in Bob's favor, but I'm still trying to get a decent share of the remaining value. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer."
