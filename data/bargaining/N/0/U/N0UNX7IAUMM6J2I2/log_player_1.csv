"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 80% of the original $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the numbers are now:

* Alice gain: $5000 (pre-inflation: $6,250)
* Bob gain: $5000 (pre-inflation: $6,250)

I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
