"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, reflecting my willingness to take the lead in this negotiation. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast, Bob! I think you're trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'd like to propose a compromise.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in favor of Bob, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. But I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of proposing first.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, and I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself."
