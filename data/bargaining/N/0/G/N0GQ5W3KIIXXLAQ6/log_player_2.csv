**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on and the value of my potential winnings is decreasing, accepting Alice's offer at this stage would be a mistake.  She's clearly aiming to take the lion's share, and I believe I can still negotiate a better outcome.  I need to show I'm serious about walking away if necessary."

It's clear you're aiming to take most of the money. This is the closest to even we're going to get. After this, I'm better off walking away with nothing.""}
