"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get a decent amount of money upfront, but still leave Bob with a significant portion to keep him interested in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him than my initial offer, but I still get a decent amount. I'll accept this offer.
