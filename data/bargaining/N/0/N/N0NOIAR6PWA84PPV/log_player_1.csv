"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. Given the inflation rates, I'm taking into account that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for Bob than for me. This initial offer is an attempt to find a middle ground, slightly in my favor, while considering the impact of inflation on future rounds. The message to Bob emphasizes fairness but also sets the stage for negotiations, hinting that I'm willing to listen to counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, this is my counter-offer. The clock is ticking! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, despite the effects of inflation, accepting $45 in the second round would mean I'm agreeing to a worse deal than what I initially proposed. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, the $45 offered by Bob is effectively less valuable than the $45 I initially offered him. Additionally, Bob's message hints at the pressure of time and the devaluing of money, but given the asymmetrical inflation rates, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the effects of inflation on both of us. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the initial round, I'm aiming to find a compromise that reflects these changes. By offering $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, I'm moving closer to the middle ground while still recognizing the greater impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings. The message to Bob emphasizes the need to consider the devaluing of money over time and the importance of reaching an agreement sooner rather than later."
