"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a slightly larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think it's still biased towards Bob. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think 42/58 is fair""
}

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but I'm still holding firm on a 42/58 split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still pushing for a larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting aggressive! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's extremely lopsided in Bob's favor. I think I can do better than this, and I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me!"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 7:
