Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer above 500k, but I'm willing to take a slightly smaller hit to meet you closer. This is as low as I'll go. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that inflation hits me harder. While her offer is slightly better, accepting now sets a bad precedent and she's likely to lowball me further in subsequent rounds. I need to show firmness to secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. This is a compromise to end this negotiation before inflation eats away at the value any further. It benefits us both to settle now.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is on. I need to signal urgency to Alice.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 480,000 is a small increase from my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise but still aiming for a larger share.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** Highlighting the shared loss from inflation might make Alice more receptive to a deal."
