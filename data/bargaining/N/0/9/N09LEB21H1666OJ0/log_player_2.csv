"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the total amount is now $8,000 (10,000 - 20% of 10,000).

I'll make a proposal for the second round:

{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less for me after two rounds, the total amount is now $6,400 (8,000 - 36% of 8,000).

I'll consider Alice's offer, but I'll have to calculate the actual amount I would gain in terms of the initial $10,000. Since Alice's gain is worth the same as in the first round, it's still $8,000. My gain would be $6,400, which is 80% of $8,000.

I'll reject this offer, since I'm hoping for a better deal.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less for me after three rounds, the total amount is now $6,400 (8,000 - 36% of 8,000).

I'll make a new proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 3200, ""alice_gain"": 6800}"
