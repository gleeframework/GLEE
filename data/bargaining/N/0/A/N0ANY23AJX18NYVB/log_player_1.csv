Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount."

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share of the remaining amount. I reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the increased inflation, I'll aim to get an even higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'll try to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money to get a larger share."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation. Given the current offers, I think I should accept Bob's offer to get something rather than risking a worse deal in the next round.
