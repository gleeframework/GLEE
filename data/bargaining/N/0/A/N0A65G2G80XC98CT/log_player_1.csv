I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a good starting point, and I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a fair, but slightly skewed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome. I'd rather take the guaranteed $500,000 than risk getting less in a later round."
