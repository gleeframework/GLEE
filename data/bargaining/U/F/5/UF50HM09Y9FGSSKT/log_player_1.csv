# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 4500 is still too low. Let's try to find a better middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. $4,500 is a bit less than I was hoping for, but $5,500 is also a bit too high for me. I think this is a fair middle ground."
