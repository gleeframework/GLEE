"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take something, it's better to see what Alice will offer next.  There's a lot of money on the line, and with inflation, waiting could be beneficial."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives Alice a decent share, but it also leaves a significant portion for me.  Let's see if she's willing to accept this deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Even though the money is worth less for me due to inflation, I'm still going to reject this offer.  Alice is getting a much bigger share, and there are still rounds to go. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. Inflation is biting, but it seems like Alice might be willing to compromise. Let's see if she agrees."
