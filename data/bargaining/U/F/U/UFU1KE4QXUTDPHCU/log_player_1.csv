"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still a bit biased towards him, but I suppose it's a slightly better deal than the previous one.

I'll accept this offer for now. I'll take the 4000$.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
