""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair resolution.  My offer acknowledges the value decrease while still providing you a decent portion. Let's settle this before inflation erodes the gains further. 
# Bob gain: 370000 
# Alice gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still trying to take a much larger share.  While the time pressure is on, accepting a bad deal will only hurt more in the long run."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here. This offer still gives you a considerable amount, even considering inflation. We should make a deal now before our potential gains shrink even further. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is stubbornly clinging to getting a larger share even though time is running very short. This offer is barely better than her last one considering the inflation.  We need to push her to be more realistic."

{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your frustration, but I'm trying to reach a fair agreement. This offer considers the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable share.  Let's be sensible and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful to accept this, but with the rapid inflation, it's the best we're going to get.  It's much better to take this offer now than risk getting even less in the following rounds where our potential gains will be minuscule."
