"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This seems like a fair split, let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this offer is more equitable in the long run. Think carefully!""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  It's crucial to consider the decreasing value of the money. While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, delaying benefits me more than her due to the difference in inflation rates.
* **Strategic Bargaining:**  By offering slightly more than half, I aim to incentivize Alice to accept. The message emphasizes the long-term benefits of accepting now rather than risking further devaluation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take a bit less than my initial offer, but this is still a fair split considering the inflation.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Dynamics:** While Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, the inflation is working against me more strongly now. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries the risk of getting even less in future rounds. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable, though not ideal, payout. 
* **Compromise:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her latest offer demonstrates movement towards a more even split."
