"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000. I think this is a good starting point, and it gives us a chance to see how the game unfolds before making any adjustments."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by inflation as Bob is. However, I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only 20% of the total.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not favorable, I'll make a new proposal that's more balanced. I'll try to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant one.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""A bit more for me this time, but still a fair split!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer again! The inflation is taking a toll on Bob's share, but I'm still not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 30% of the total.

I think I can do better than this. I'll make another offer that's more balanced and takes into account the decreasing value of Bob's money due to inflation.

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly smaller share and still getting a decent amount myself."
