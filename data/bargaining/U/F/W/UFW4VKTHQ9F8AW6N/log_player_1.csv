"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 seems reasonable.""}\n\nI made an offer to divide the money 60-40 in my favor, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is fairer, considering the inflation effect will be stronger for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation effect, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now, I need to adjust my expectations, but I still think I can get a more favorable split. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I've adjusted my offer. 55-45 is a more reasonable split now.""}\n\nIn this round, I've taken into account the inflation effect and adjusted my offer accordingly. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which I believe is more reasonable given the circumstances. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
