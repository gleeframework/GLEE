I'm starting with a strong offer, giving Bob a smaller share.  Let's see if he's willing to accept early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, especially considering the inflation. I'm going to reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a larger share. Bob rejected my previous offer, so I'm trying to find a compromise while still benefiting from the inflation impacting Bob's gains more than mine."
