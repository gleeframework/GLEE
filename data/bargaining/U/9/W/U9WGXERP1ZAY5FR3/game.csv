4000.0,6000.0,Your turn Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's be realistic - it's better to secure a good amount now than risk getting nothing later as inflation eats away at the value.,Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to negotiate, but a 60/40 split in your favor is too much. Let's aim for a 55/45 split - it's a more balanced approach.",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Okay, Alice, let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing a 52/48 split. It's closer to your offer, but still acknowledges that I'm taking on more risk by moving later in the game.  Time is money, and that money is losing value!",Bob,4,
