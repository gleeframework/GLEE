Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's be realistic - it's better to secure a good amount now than risk getting nothing later as inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing a 52/48 split. It's closer to your offer, but still acknowledges that I'm taking on more risk by moving later in the game.  Time is money, and that money is losing value!
