"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10. You get a smaller share, but I'm willing to give you a fair deal for a quick resolution.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve a larger portion considering the original amount. Let's see if you can accept this compromise. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'd rather not risk going to the next round and having my gain worth even less due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
