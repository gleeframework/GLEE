"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering to split the money evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative values. I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now effectively $8,000. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000

I'm offering a slightly skewed deal, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
