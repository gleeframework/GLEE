"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided offer in my favor.  Since the money is worth less to me each round, I'll take the vast majority and leave Bob with a tiny amount. This is a risky strategy, but if he rejects, I'll have a chance to make a similar offer in the next round with even more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, this offer is a significant improvement over the previous round. Accepting guarantees me a substantial amount of money, even with the 20% inflation. It's much better than risking getting nothing if I reject and Bob makes a less generous offer in the next round."
