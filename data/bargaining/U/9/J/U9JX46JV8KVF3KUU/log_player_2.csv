Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but 60-40 is too much. Let's split it 55-45. This is a fair compromise considering inflation, and it gives you a good share.

# Alice gain: 55
