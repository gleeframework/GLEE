"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what kind of offer Alice makes next. This initial offer is too lopsided in her favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can negotiate further if you prefer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give you more this time, but we need to get this done before the inflation hurts us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still proposing a significantly larger share for herself. While the offer is slightly better, I'm willing to gamble that we can achieve a more balanced split in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share than our previous offer, but I'm still holding out for a more even split. Let's reach an agreement before we lose too much to inflation.""}
