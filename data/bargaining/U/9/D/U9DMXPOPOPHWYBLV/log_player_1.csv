"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want a slightly bigger piece 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is now worth 10% less than the original, so he's trying to get a slightly bigger piece, but I'm not sure if it's fair.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to get a bit more for myself this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You said you wanted a slightly bigger piece last round, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the first to propose a fair split!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not falling for it. I'll give you a slightly smaller piece this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me this time! With inflation, his offer is actually a pretty good deal for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing for him. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
