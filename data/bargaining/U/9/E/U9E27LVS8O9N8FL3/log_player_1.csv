"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k and keep 600k for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of 250,000 is worth 90% of the original value, since it's 10% less due to inflation. So, it's effectively 225,000.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 25% share, but I'll consider it. I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the 25% share, can we try to meet in the middle at 50%?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 90% of the original value, due to the 10% inflation. So, I'll keep this in mind when making my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55% is a fair share. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob in the middle, but I'm still leaning towards a slightly higher share for myself."
