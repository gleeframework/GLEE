Initially, Alice proposes a 60-40 split, considering fairness without the inflation factor. As the game progresses and inflation affects Bob's share, Alice adjusts her offers to reflect the changing value, aiming to maximize her gain while still appearing reasonable to Bob. Bob, on the other hand, tries to counteroffer with splits that acknowledge the decreasing value of his share but also aim to find a middle ground acceptable to both parties. Eventually, they settle on a 60-40 split in round 6, showing that despite the strategic back-and-forth, the initial proposal ends up being the acceptable compromise after considering the effects of inflation.\n\n###\n\nThe final answer is:\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}\n\n###\n\nLet's play again if you want.\n\n###\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}"
