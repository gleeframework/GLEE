"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount. Accept and we can end the game early. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to offer you a fair share, Alice.  Let's end this quickly and avoid any further inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split the money 50-50 and end the game. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's not ideal, but it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing.  Let's end this now."
