"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, giving Bob 400,000 dollars and myself 600,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to offer you a fair share, Alice.  Let's end this quickly and avoid any further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting the game!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split. I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering I'm willing to wait for a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split the money 50-50 and end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to end the game quickly and avoid further inflation."
