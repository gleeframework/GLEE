"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 90% to me and 10% to you. I think it's a good starting point.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the original $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and Bob gets 10%, which is $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think 2:1 is a fairer ratio. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 2:1 ratio, as I think it's too skewed towards Bob. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 72% to me and 28% to you is a more reasonable ratio. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 3:2 is a more balanced ratio. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth even less than in the previous round. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 576000,
  ""bob_gain"": 424000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think 57.6% to me and 42.4% to you is a fairer ratio. Let's try to find a middle ground.""
