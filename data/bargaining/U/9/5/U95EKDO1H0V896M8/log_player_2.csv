**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $400,000 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is escalating.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of Alice's potential offers is decreasing with each round due to inflation. Her offers are unlikely to get significantly better for Bob.
* **Guaranteed Payout:** Accepting ensures a reasonable payout. Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds is increasingly risky. 

It's frustrating to concede, but sometimes a guaranteed win, even if smaller than hoped, is the smartest play."
