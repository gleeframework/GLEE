"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be fair, but I think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too even-handed. I'd like to get a bit more, considering the inflation factor. However, I don't want to reject the offer outright, so I'll accept it.
