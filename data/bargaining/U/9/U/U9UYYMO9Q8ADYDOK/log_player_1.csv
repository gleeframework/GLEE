"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to be generous""
}
```

I'm proposing that I take $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. The message is a bit of a warning, letting Bob know that I'm not planning to give him the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it fair 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less, so the total amount is 800,000$. I'm not sure if meeting halfway is the best strategy, considering the decreasing value of money. However, it's a fair offer, and it's a good opportunity to get half of the remaining amount.

I accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
