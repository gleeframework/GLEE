"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems generous on the surface, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting this offer means I lose out on potential gains over the next 11 rounds. It's worth negotiating for a better deal, especially since the value of the money decreases rapidly for me with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  I'm hit harder by inflation each round. I'll accept a reversal of your previous offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Turn the Tables:** By mirroring Alice's previous offer, I'm highlighting the inherent unfairness of her proposal considering the inflation working against me.
* **Strong Starting Point:** This offer gives me a good initial position for negotiation. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and explains my reasoning, increasing the chances of Alice taking my proposal seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side, let's try again 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  Her offer is even worse than the first round, and the longer this goes on, the more the value of the money decreases for me. It's still too early to accept an offer this low.  I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need you to acknowledge the impact inflation is having on my share.  This is a compromise.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  While I want a 55/45 split, offering a 52.5/47.5 split shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the deal gets worse for me. This offer is a strong signal that I want to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.
* **Clear Justification:** I'm reiterating the inflation issue, which is crucial for Alice to understand.  By framing it as a compromise, I'm hoping she'll be more receptive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll on your share, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is getting ridiculous. Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but her offer is getting worse with every round! It's clear she's banking on my fear of inflation to force a bad deal. I need to stand my ground, but I also need to signal I'm willing to be flexible to get this done."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  I'm offering you a deal where you still get a slight advantage. This is more than fair considering the inflation.  I need to get a win here, and this is your fastest way to do that.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Strategy:** Alice is clearly playing hardball. To counter this, I'm slightly adjusting my approach to create a sense of urgency and appeal to her desire for a quick win.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm moving slightly closer to a 50/50 split, but still maintaining a position where I get a larger share to offset the inflation. 
* **Framing the Deal:** By emphasizing that Alice ""wins"" with this deal, I'm making it more appealing for her to accept. I'm acknowledging her position of strength due to the inflation but still pushing for a solution that benefits me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'll take a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting greedier! This offer is the worst yet.  She's betting that I'll crack under the pressure of inflation and accept any deal offered.  I can't let her win this game of chicken.  It's time to show her I'm serious about walking away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome considering how much value I'm losing with each round.  Accept this, and we both walk away with something.  Reject it, and we both get nothing.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** It's time to draw a line in the sand.  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm communicating that I'm not willing to negotiate further.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split might seem like a concession, but it's the only truly fair outcome given the inflation working against me. 
* **Ultimatum:** Alice needs to understand the gravity of the situation. Continuing to play her game will only lead to a lose-lose scenario where we both get nothing.  This offer is her last chance to secure a win."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I'll take advantage of that 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is delusional if she thinks I'll accept a deal where I lose over a third of the value due to inflation. This offer is insulting. She's clearly not negotiating in good faith.  It's risky, but I have to show her I'm willing to walk away.  Maybe then she'll realize I'm serious."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  We're down to the wire.  I'm sticking with my 50/50 offer.  It's the only fair deal, and it's our last chance to walk away with something.  Don't let greed ruin us both.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No More Games:** Alice needs to understand that time is running out.  I'm removing any ambiguity by sticking with the 50/50 split and reiterating that this is the final offer.
* **Appeal to Logic and Emotion:**  I'm combining a logical appeal (""the only fair deal"") with an emotional one (""Don't let greed ruin us both"").  This final push might be what she needs to make a rational decision. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  There's a chance Alice will reject this again, but it's a risk I have to take. By now, she should realize I'm serious about walking away, and hopefully, she values getting something over nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, I'll take the lion's share 
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is absurd! Alice is trying to steal from me at this point.  She's clearly banking on me panicking with only one round left. I'd rather walk away with nothing than let her take advantage of me like this. I'm holding my ground."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I've offered you a fair deal for 5 rounds straight. You've chosen greed and now we're here.  It's 50/50 or nothing. I'm done playing your game.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:**  This is the final round, and there's no room for negotiation. I'm sticking with the 50/50 split, even though it means potentially getting nothing.
* **Calling Out Greed:** I'm directly addressing Alice's behavior, highlighting the consequences of her choices.  Sometimes, a blunt approach is necessary to break through. 
* **No Regrets:**  I've made my position crystal clear.  Whatever Alice decides, I can walk away knowing I acted fairly and consistently throughout this process.  It's all on her now."
