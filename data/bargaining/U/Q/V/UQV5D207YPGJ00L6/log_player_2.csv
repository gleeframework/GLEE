Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle.  This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. Although the inflation is hurting my potential gains, it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
