I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping Bob will accept. Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, this is a fair deal for me. I'd rather take the guaranteed 5000 than risk getting even less in the next round."
