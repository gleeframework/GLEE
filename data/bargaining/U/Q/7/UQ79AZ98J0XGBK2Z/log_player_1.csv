"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

I'm proposing that we both get $5,000 each, which is a 50-50 split. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount of money, and we can negotiate further if we want to. What do you think, Bob?"
