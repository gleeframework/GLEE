"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose keeping 90 dollars for myself and giving Bob 10 dollars.  I'm starting with a generous offer, but I expect Bob to be reasonable and accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counter with my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering 80 dollars for myself and 20 dollars for Bob.  I'm willing to concede a bit, but I still believe a more balanced split is fair, considering inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still very unbalanced, and the inflation is significantly impacting the value of my potential gains. I'll make another offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my proposal to 70 dollars for myself and 30 dollars for Bob. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but I still need to ensure a fair outcome for myself given the significant inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable, and the inflation is starting to take a serious toll.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering 60 dollars for myself and 40 dollars for Bob. I'm willing to concede more, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable share of the money before inflation completely erodes its value."
