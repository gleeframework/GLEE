"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI made an offer to divide the money, where I'll take $6000 (60% of the total) and Bob will get $4000 (40% of the total). I included a message to Bob, suggesting that this is a fair division. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a fair split. Let's call it even. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal. Although the money is worth 5% less to me now, I still believe that a 40-60 split is not fair. I'll make a new proposal in the next round. Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI made a new offer, taking into account the 5% decrease in value for me. I'm willing to take $5800 (58% of the total) and Bob will get $4200 (42% of the total). I included a message to Bob, suggesting that we meet in the middle, considering the inflation. Let me know how Bob responds!"
