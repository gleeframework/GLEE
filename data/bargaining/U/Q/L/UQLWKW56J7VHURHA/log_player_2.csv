"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand you want a bit more, so let's compromise. This offer ensures a larger gain for both of us in the long run.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer was crucial.** Accepting 4000$ while she gets 6000$ puts us at a significant disadvantage.
* **Time is money.**  While waiting for a better offer sounds tempting, inflation eats into the total value. It's better to aim for a reasonable deal now.
* **The offer:**  I'm proposing 4800$ for me and 5200$ for Alice. This acknowledges her desire for a larger share while still securing me a better outcome than round 1.
* **The message:**  The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" situation. By highlighting the long-run benefits due to avoiding further inflation, I hope to persuade Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, let's meet closer to my initial offer 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is trying to pressure me.**  Her latest offer is just a slight improvement from her first, attempting to take advantage of the increasing inflation. 
* **Time is pressing, but patience is key.** While the money is losing value, accepting a bad deal is worse. I need to hold my ground for a slightly better offer.
* **Alice's offer is still significantly skewed in her favor.**  Even with inflation, accepting 4200$ while she gets 5800$ is not a fair outcome. 
 
**I believe Alice will be more willing to compromise in the next round as she sees I am serious about getting a fair deal.**"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4600, ""alice_gain"": 5400, ""message"": ""Time is running out for both of us. This offer is fair and avoids further losses due to inflation. Let's close the deal and benefit mutually.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a balance:**  I've nudged my offer closer to Alice's desired split, showing a willingness to compromise. 4600$ for me and 5400$ for her is a more balanced deal.
* **Emphasizing urgency:**  The message stresses the time pressure due to inflation. Both of us are losing money with each passing round.
* **Finality and mutual benefit:** By framing the offer as a way to ""close the deal,"" I'm implying this is my final offer. Highlighting ""mutual benefit"" reinforces the idea that accepting now is the best course of action for both of us.

**I'm aiming to strike a balance between securing a reasonable share for myself and increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting before inflation erodes the value further.**"
