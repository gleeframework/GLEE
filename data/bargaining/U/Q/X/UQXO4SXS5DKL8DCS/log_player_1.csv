"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob! I'll take 90% of the initial amount, leaving you with 10%. You can't go wrong with this deal!""
}
```

I'm making a strong opening offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected by inflation as much, but I'll assume it's still a good deal for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
