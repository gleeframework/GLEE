"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the majority, but I'm sure you can get a better deal in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $1000, I'm going to reject this offer. The inflation rate means that my $1000 will be worth less in the future. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation we both need to consider. Let's get this done before our money loses more value!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this split is fair considering the inflation and that we are both losing money with each round. Let's end this and take what we can get. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is cutting into my potential gains significantly. Accepting this offer will at least guarantee me some money, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
