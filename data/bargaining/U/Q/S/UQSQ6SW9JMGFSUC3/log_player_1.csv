Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a good amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has devalued the money, this is a much better offer than my initial one and ensures we both get something."
