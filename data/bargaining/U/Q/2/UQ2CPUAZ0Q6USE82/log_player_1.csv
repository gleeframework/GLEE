"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 300k, and I'll take the rest. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Let's compromise on a 60-40 split. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'd be getting $570,000 instead of $600,000.

I'm not sure I like the 60-40 split, but it's a better offer than the first one. I'll consider it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 450k, and I'll take the rest. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. 50-50 split. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, 14.26% less than the original amount is a significant hit due to inflation!

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50-50 split is a fair compromise, especially since we've both been negotiating for a while. I'm willing to accept the offer.
