"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. My current proposal was rejected, and Bob's offer is even less favorable to me. I'll wait for a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's my turn again! Considering the continued inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is a 55-45 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns. Considering the continued erosion of the money's value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, this offer is actually a 45-55 split, which is the same as my previous offer. Given that the value of the money has decreased significantly, I'm willing to accept this offer to get something rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds.
