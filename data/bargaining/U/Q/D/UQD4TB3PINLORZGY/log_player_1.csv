"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can wrap up the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively equal split, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not accepting a 4:1 split. Let's try to find a more balanced solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
