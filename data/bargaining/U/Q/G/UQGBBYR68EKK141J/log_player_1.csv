"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share of the money, which I think is a fair deal considering we have 11 more rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it a little closer to the middle.  Accept this and we'll both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is already starting to lose value.

I'll think about it for a moment... I'm not sure if I want to give up that extra $500, but Bob's message seems reasonable. I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I want to keep negotiating to see if I can get an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45, I'll try to shift the ratio a bit more in my favor. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""You were close in the last round, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
