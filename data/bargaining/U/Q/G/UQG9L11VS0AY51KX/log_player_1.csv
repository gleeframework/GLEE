"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $900,000 and Bob will get $100,000. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for a fair division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a more balanced split, Alice. Let's be reasonable and avoid unnecessary rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I now have to consider a lower amount for myself.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $450,000 and Bob will take $550,000. It's a more balanced split, and I'm willing to accept it to move on to the next round."
