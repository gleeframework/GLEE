"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's split the million!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal. However, considering the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth 10% less than the $300,000 I would have gotten in the first round, but it's still a significant amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
