"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000 and take $6,000 for myself.""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, considering the inflation rates. I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively generous amount, considering he'll only lose 5% of its value each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle with a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, a 50/50 split is actually a relatively good deal for me. I'll accept Bob's offer.
