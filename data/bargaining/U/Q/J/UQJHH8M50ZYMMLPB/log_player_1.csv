"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that! I'm willing to split it fairly, but I deserve a bit more for taking the initiative this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the 10% inflation from the previous round. Since the money is now worth 90% of its original value, I'll aim for a more favorable split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a slight edge this time""
}
