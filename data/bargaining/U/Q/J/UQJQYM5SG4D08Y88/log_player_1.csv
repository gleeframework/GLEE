"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a generous offer, aiming to secure a quick win.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as it's a good chunk of the money for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I was initially offered.  I'm willing to take the risk and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 600,000. While the inflation is hurting, I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept before we both lose more money in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  It's the best I've been offered so far, and I don't want to risk another round and potentially get an even worse deal."
