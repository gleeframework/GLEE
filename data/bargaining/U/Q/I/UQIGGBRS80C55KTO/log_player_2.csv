Let's see what a better deal I can get!  I'm sure I can do better than 450,000 considering the inflation rate."

I'm still not happy with this offer. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm not going to give in this early. Let's see what happens in the next round."

This is getting ridiculous.  I'm not going to give in to Alice's demands. The inflation is making it harder for me, but I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal."
