"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. What do you say?""
}
```

This offer is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the hassle of negotiating further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering you got the better end of the deal last time. Let's see if you accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to try to flip the script!

Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain from Bob's offer:

Alice gain: 400,000 / 0.8 = 500,000

With this adjustment, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (0.8^2 = 0.64), I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 70% is a fairer share, considering the inflation. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting us both, but I think 70/30 is a fair compromise. If we don't agree, we'll both lose more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% of its original value now (0.8^3 = 0.512), I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain from Bob's offer:

Alice gain: 300,000 / 0.512 = 585,156

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but I'm starting to worry about the time running out. I'll accept this offer to avoid losing even more in the next round.
