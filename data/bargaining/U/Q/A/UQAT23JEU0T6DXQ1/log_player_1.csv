"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation will affect Bob more strongly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is far too unfavorable to me. While Bob's offer is much closer to an even split, he is still receiving significantly more, and the inflation will impact him less. I will reject this offer and propose a different split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
``` 

I propose Alice receives $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000.  This is a more equitable split than Bob's last offer, and it accounts for the inflation we are both facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my preferred split, it is still heavily skewed in his favor. The inflation is heavily impacting him, making his gains less and less valuable.  I will reject this offer and propose a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I propose an even split of $500,000 for each of us.  With the inflation hitting both of us hard now, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the remaining money."
