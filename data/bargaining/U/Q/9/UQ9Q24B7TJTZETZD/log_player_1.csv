I'm not happy with the 40/60 split, and I think I can do better. I'll try to negotiate further!"

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the 42/58 split, but I think it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting an even worse deal. I'll take the 420,000 and call it a day."
