"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split. I propose taking $6,000 while you get $4,000. This seems fair to me given the inflation we are dealing with. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a more balanced split.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the initial offer, but the inflation is significant.  I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be acknowledged. I propose $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you. This is a more reasonable adjustment considering the value decrease. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While not ideal, Alice's offer in round 3 is better than what I could potentially secure in later rounds. The inflation is working against her, but it's also possible she'll become more desperate and offer a worse deal in the next round hoping I'll panic. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount."
