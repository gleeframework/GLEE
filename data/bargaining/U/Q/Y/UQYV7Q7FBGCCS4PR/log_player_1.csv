"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the total amount. I'm keeping $700,000, which is 70% of the total amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $360,000. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob's proposal, considering the value of my share is decreasing over time. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more. This way, we can end the game sooner.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the total amount. I'm keeping $550,000, which is 55% of the total amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
