7500.0,2500.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split it 75/25. This gives you a larger share than the first round, and we can work our way up to a more equal split in the future if you're agreeable.",Alice,3,

6000.0,4000.0,"I understand your position, Bob.  Let's try a 60/40 split. It's closer to your last offer, and it gives us both something to work with. We can move towards a more even split later if we both find it beneficial.",Alice,5,
