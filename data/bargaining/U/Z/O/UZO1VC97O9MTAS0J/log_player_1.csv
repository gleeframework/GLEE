I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor will benefit Bob more in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm going to offer a 45/55 split in Bob's favor. While he's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, I'm hoping this is a fair enough offer to incentivize him to accept.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk losing too much more in the next round."
