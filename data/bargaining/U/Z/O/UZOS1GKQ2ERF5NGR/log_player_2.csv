"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to get more. Considering the inflation, I'll offer a bit less than half, to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth 36% less than the 50 I would have gotten in the first round, which is 32.4. That's a bit better than the 30 I would have gotten if I had accepted Alice's offer in round 1.

I'll accept this offer.
