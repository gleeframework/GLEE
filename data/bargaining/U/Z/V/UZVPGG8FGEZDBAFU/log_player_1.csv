Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 equally, with each of us getting $50. This is a fair and simple start to the game."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob took a larger share last round, I'll try to adjust the ratio a bit.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not as big as last round""}

I'm proposing that I get 45 and Bob gets 55. This is a slightly more generous offer than the initial split, but I'm still trying to maintain a reasonable balance."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more strategic.

{""alice_gain"": 38, ""bob_gain"": 62, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm trying to hold on to some value""}

I'm proposing that I get 38 and Bob gets 62. This is a more generous offer from my side, but I'm trying to conserve some value in the face of inflation."
