"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation impact on my side. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems reasonable on the surface, it's important to consider the impact of inflation. In this first round, Alice's side loses 20% of its value, while my side only loses 10%. Therefore, I'm better off rejecting and seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm starting with a fair offer, taking into account the inflation rates.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer wasn't ideal considering the faster inflation for me. I'm adjusting my offer slightly, hoping we can settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While the initial offer looked good, Alice's offer in round 3 is now more attractive. The fact that her offer is only slightly adjusted suggests a willingness to compromise. 
* **My loss:**  The 19% inflation hit on my side means the 4200 is slightly less than 3400 in the first round. However, it's still a better outcome than rejecting again.
* **Risk:**  Continuing to reject risks ending up with nothing.  It's more prudent to take this slightly reduced offer."
