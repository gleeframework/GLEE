# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly, Bob. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. This ensures I get a larger share considering the impact of inflation on my potential earnings in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to account for the significant inflation impact. Let's settle this now with a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a compromise, as I'm willing to accept a slightly lower amount than my initial offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
