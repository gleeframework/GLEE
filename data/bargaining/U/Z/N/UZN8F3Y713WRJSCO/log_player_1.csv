"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, with me getting a slight majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation. Since Bob's offer is better than my initial offer, and considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept it.
