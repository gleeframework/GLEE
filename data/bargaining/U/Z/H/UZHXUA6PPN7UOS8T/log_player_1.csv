"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both be happy with this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more for my part in this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that I should accept a 70-30 split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a more reasonable split considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $55 and Bob $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think this is the maximum I can afford considering the inflation. I hope you can accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Considering the significant reduction in the value of the money due to inflation, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to accept the 75-25 split, giving me $75 and Bob $25. It's better to settle for a smaller share now rather than risking further erosion of the value of the money."
