"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I have to be strategic about when to accept an offer. An even split might seem fair, but I'm hoping to get a bit more than that, considering the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'd like a bit more than half. This way, we both still get a good amount.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm aiming to get a bit more than half of the total amount, considering the 10% decrease in value for me. I believe this offer is still reasonable for Alice, as she doesn't lose any value over time. Let's see how she responds!"
