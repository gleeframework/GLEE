"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10, I'll take 90. We can always adjust later. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While she proposes adjusting later, there's no guarantee of that happening. It's better to negotiate for a fairer split early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, my turn. Let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the risk I'm taking with inflation.  What do you say?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point about inflation. Let's split it 55/45, with a bit more for you to account for the risk.  It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to acknowledge the inflation, but her offer is still not favorable enough. Accepting 45 now means I'm losing significantly more value than she is. I need to push for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value keeps shrinking for me. I'm proposing 65/35. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't accept a 65/35 split. Let's meet in the middle at 45/55. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but time is running out. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting 55 now is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds as inflation eats away at the value."
