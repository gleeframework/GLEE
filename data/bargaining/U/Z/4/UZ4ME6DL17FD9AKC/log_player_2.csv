"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob. Take this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'll try to get a bit more than I would have in the previous round to make up for the loss in value. I'll also include a message to try to persuade Alice to accept my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, let's find a middle ground. This way, we both get a decent share, and I won't have to worry about the inflation eating away at my gains. It's a fair deal!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is working against you. My offer is still generous. Don't miss out! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the value of the money is decreasing for me due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal than 30. I've already offered Alice a 55 share in the previous round, so I think there's room for negotiation. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!

###\n\nAlso, since the money is now worth 9.75% less for me than in the first round, I'll have to take that into account when making my next offer. I'll try to adjust my proposal accordingly to ensure I get a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 42, ""alice_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""Alice, I know inflation is working against me, but I'm still willing to find a compromise. This offer takes into account the decreased value of the money for me, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's settle on this before the value drops further!""}"
