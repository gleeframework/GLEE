"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $90 for myself and give $10 to Bob.  This way, I secure most of the money while still being fair in my first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While I'm not happy with this offer, it's better to reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  I'm hoping that by rejecting Bob's offer, he will be willing to compromise more in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I propose a more even split this time. Given the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and take only $45, leaving $55 for Bob. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a reasonable share."
