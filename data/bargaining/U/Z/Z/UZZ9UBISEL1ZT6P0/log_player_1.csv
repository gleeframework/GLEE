"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10$ and keeping 90$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can work together to make this game worthwhile for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll try to get a better deal for myself.

  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.""
