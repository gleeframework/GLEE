"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I propose to keep almost all the money and give Bob a single dollar.  This is a very aggressive starting point to see if he is willing to negotiate or not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer.  It's better to take half the money than to risk getting nothing at all."
