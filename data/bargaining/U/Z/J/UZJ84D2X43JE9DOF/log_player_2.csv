"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and we can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. 60/40 seems a bit too skewed in Alice's favor, considering we're just starting out. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's a bit more balanced. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice, I'll take that into account.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I propose a 55/45 split. It's more balanced, and we should both be happy with this division.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I propose a 50/50 split, given the inflation we've both experienced. This is the most fair and equitable way to move forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the inflation and Alice's willingness to meet in the middle, I think this is a reasonable offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the deal and split the money 50/50. It's a fair outcome, and we can both walk away satisfied."
