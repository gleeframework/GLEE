I'm starting with a relatively high offer for myself, hoping to secure a good deal quickly.  However, I'm aware of the inflation risk, so I'm not being greedy. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal. I'm aware of the inflation risk, but I won't accept such a drastic decrease in my share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm lowering my demand slightly to try and reach a compromise.  I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I recognize the importance of finding a solution that Bob might find acceptable, given the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation has significantly impacted Bob's side, making his offer much more appealing now.  Given the potential for further inflation in future rounds, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action."
