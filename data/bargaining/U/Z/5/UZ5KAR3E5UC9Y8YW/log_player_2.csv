Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing a fortune with every passing round! Accept this generous offer and let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but her offer is still not advantageous to me. I need to hold out for a better deal, aiming for a split closer to even or even slightly in my favor."

Round 6

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm making a concession. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While not ideal, this offer is now within a reasonable range. Accepting ensures I get a substantial sum, whereas continued rejection risks getting nothing if we fail to agree in time.  Alice seems firm this is her final offer, and the pressure is on both of us with the dwindling rounds."
