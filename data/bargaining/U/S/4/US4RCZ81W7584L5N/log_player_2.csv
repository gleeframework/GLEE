Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Inflation is eating into the potential gains. Accepting $4,400 now is better than holding out for a slightly larger sum that'll be worth considerably less in later rounds. 
* **Uncertain Outcome:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal, and her previous offers suggest she's aiming for a larger share.

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk losing everything to inflation and a stalemate."
