"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more aggressive start, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more careful. Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to think about whether 4000 is a good deal for me now.

I'll reject this offer for now. I want to make a counteroffer that will give me a better deal considering the inflation.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting my gain, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle!""

# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains. With the money being worth 14.26% less for me, I need to be even more careful. Bob's offer is still a bit more in his favor, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer, as I think I can do better. I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the increased inflation.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation really taking a toll on my gains, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. However, I also don't want to leave myself with too little, so I'll try to find a balance. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up, meet me in the middle-ish!""
}
```
