"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a more equitable split. Let's try 60/40 in my favor this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give away as much. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too generous for you, Bob. I'll think of something else.""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth even less now, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is my best offer so far.""
}"
