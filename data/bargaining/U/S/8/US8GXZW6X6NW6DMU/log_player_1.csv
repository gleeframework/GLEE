I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer in round 2 secures me a significant amount, and with Bob's offer decreasing in value every round due to inflation, I'm unlikely to get a better deal."
