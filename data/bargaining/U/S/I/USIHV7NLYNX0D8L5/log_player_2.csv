"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my initial offer. I propose we split the money 3:2 in favor of Bob, considering the risk of inflation and the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is generous, I believe we can secure a better deal by pushing for a more even split.  I'm confident we can negotiate a fairer outcome."
