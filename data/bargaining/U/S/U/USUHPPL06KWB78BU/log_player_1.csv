Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round. I want to see how greedy Bob is, and this will give me a good idea of how he'll act in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to get more, it's a good idea to accept this offer. Bob is clearly willing to split the money evenly, and it's likely that he'll continue to propose this split in future rounds. With inflation kicking in, it's better to secure a guaranteed half now than risk getting a worse offer later."
