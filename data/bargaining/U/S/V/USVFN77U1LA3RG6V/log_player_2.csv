Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's compromise, I've lowered my share a bit 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time is running out! Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, I'm being generous considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is significantly decreasing for Bob with each round. Accepting $43 now is better than risking an even lower offer in the future.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently offered proposals favoring herself.  It's unlikely she'll drastically change her position in a final round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer holds the risk of getting a worse deal in the final round, with no guarantee of a better outcome. 

While not ideal, taking the $43 (worth much less in real terms) is the safest option to avoid walking away with even less."
