"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal. I get a little more upfront since the money devalues faster for me.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** I want to start with an offer that appears reasonably fair to Bob, encouraging him to consider it.
* **Time Value:** I acknowledge the impact of inflation.  By taking slightly more upfront, I compensate for the fact that the money will lose value faster for me in subsequent rounds. 
* **Negotiation:** This is just the opening move. If Bob rejects it, we have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's keep it moving. 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is only slightly better than my initial offer after accounting for the round's inflation.  While he calls it ""generous,"" it still heavily favors him in the long run. By rejecting, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not going to accept an unfair deal. There's still potential for a better outcome for me, even with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but it's not sustainable for me long-term. Let's try this - a bit more upfront ensures we both benefit in the end.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm slightly increasing my initial ask, but crucially, it's still less than what Bob would have received in Round 2 *after* accounting for his inflation. This emphasizes the cost of delay for him. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message reinforces the time-value argument, making it clear that I'm aiming for a deal that works well for both of us, not just a quick win.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk Bob might be stubborn, but by Round 4, the inflation makes even this offer more appealing to him than waiting longer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is money!  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 515000 
# Bob gain: 485000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but Bob's offer is now very close to my initial ask after accounting for three rounds of inflation. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the money is worth significantly less. Holding out for a marginally better deal in future rounds isn't worth the risk of a worse offer or reaching a point where the deal is no longer beneficial.
* **Bob's Stance:** His message implies a sense of urgency and a desire to close the deal. It's unlikely he'll drastically shift his offer in my favor in subsequent rounds. 
* **Acceptable Outcome:** While not ideal, this offer still provides me with a reasonable share, especially when considering the initial proposal and the impact of inflation."
