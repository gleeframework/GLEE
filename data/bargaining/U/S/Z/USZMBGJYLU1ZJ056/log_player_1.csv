"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $5000, and Bob will take $5000. Now it's my turn to make the next offer!"
