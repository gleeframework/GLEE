"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob!  While 100,000 is a decent chunk of change, the inflation will eat away at the value of that money quickly. There's definitely room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm happy to split the money fairly.  Let's go with 55/45. This ensures a good outcome for both of us, and avoids the risk of inflation eating into our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, I think 70/30 is a more reasonable split. I'll take a larger share to ensure my gain doesn't get eroded further. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the 300,000 is tempting, it's still a bad deal.  There is still room for negotiation, and I don't want to lose too much more to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""With the inflation, I think we should aim for a 60/40 split.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round.""}
