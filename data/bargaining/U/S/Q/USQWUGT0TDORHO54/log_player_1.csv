"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good deal, let's split it 70-30""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, let's split it 80-20 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 200000 * 0.95 = 190000
* Bob's gain: 800000 * 0.95 = 760000

I don't think 20% is a fair share for me, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, 55-45 is a fair split""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's split it 60-40 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 14.26% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 400000 * 0.8554 = 342,160
* Bob's gain: 600000 * 0.8554 = 513,24

I don't think 40% is a good enough share for me, so I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking control, 60-40 is the new reality""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up, let's split it 55-45 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 22.62% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 450000 * 0.7778 = 349,550
* Bob's gain: 550000 * 0.7778 = 426,89

I think 45% is a decent share for me, considering the decreasing value of money. I'll accept this offer.
