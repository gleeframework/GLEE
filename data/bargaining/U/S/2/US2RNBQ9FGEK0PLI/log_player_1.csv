"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

My gain: $4000
Value after inflation: $4000 / 0.95 = $4210.53 (approximately)

Bob's gain: $6000

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offer, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm hoping that this offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering the inflation and the previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the offer considering the inflation:

My gain: $3500
Value after inflation: $3500 / 0.855 (1 - 0.145 = 0.855) = $4090.47 (approximately)

Bob's gain: $6500

Considering the offer, I think I'm being taken advantage of by the inflation. My gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round, and Bob's gain remains the same. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll aim for a higher share again. However, I'll also take into account that Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round, which is a significant advantage. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's go back to a 50-50 split, considering the inflation and the previous offers""
}
```

I'm trying to revert to a more even split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
