"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair offer considering the risk of inflation.  Let's hope Bob is reasonable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The inflation is a major factor, and refusing this offer risks getting nothing in the end. It's better to secure 80% now than risk a worse split later."
