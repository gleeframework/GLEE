Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice, but I need at least 60% to make this worth it for me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Although this offer is significantly less than what I originally wanted, it's important to consider the decreasing value of the money. 

* **My perspective:** Receiving $40 now is worth more than potentially getting a slightly better deal in a later round when the value has decreased even further.
* **Bob's perspective:** Bob's offer has also decreased significantly from his desired 50/50 split. He's likely feeling the pressure of the devaluation and wants to finalize the deal.

It's a compromise, but accepting now minimizes potential losses due to the continuous inflation."
