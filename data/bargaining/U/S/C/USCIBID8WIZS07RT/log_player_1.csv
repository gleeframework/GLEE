"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000, and I'll take $6000. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 5000, and I'll take 5000. It's a fair and equal split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as attracted to this offer as I was to the first one. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob now, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. I'll give you $3000, but I'll take $7000. It's a fair adjustment for the reduced value of your share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 7500, but I'll take 2500. It's a compromise considering the inflation and the reduced value of my share. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share! I'll consider this offer, but I'm not sure if it's good enough. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm still looking for a better deal. However, Bob's share is worth significantly less now, so I'll consider accepting this offer.
