"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is fair, considering we both have the power to reject and negotiate. Let's start with this, and see if we can work out a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
