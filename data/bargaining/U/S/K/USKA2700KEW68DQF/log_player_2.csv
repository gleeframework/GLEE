"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept a 50/50 split, but with inflation, I can potentially get more later.  I'll see if Alice is willing to give me a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'd like to take 60% this time. I think it's a fair deal considering the inflation we're facing.  What do you think?""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think you're taking too much. I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I still want a decent chunk for myself. 
# Bob gain: 700000 
# Alice gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'm taking the offer.  While I could try to get more, I don't want to risk losing everything with inflation.  700,000 is a good amount, and I'm not sure I can get much better."
