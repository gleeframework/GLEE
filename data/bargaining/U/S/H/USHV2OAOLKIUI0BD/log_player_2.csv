"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value for both of us over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's a reasonable offer, Bob can likely get a better deal. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. This way, we both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about the money losing value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, literally! I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I need a bit more to compensate for the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's get this over with! While Bob is losing value on his side, it's better to take a slightly worse deal than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
