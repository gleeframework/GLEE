"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's my turn to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll think about the relative value of the offer.

I'll accept the offer {""decision"": ""accept""}"
