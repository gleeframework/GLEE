"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the funds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount to get the ball rolling, and I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a good share before the money loses value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option, considering the money is worth 10% less now. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. 

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll aim for a bigger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a significant portion of the funds to make this worthwhile.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's compromise.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think we can both get more this way than if we continue to disagree. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Considering the money is worth 27.1% less now, I'll think carefully about this offer. I'd rather not accept a smaller share, but I don't want to risk losing out on a decent deal.

Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you a bigger share. I think I deserve the majority of the funds, considering the risks and efforts I'm taking.""

Round 6

# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more serious offer, considering the significant loss of value due to inflation. I'm not sure if I want to give up a bigger share, but I don't want to risk losing out on a decent deal either.
