  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

My gain: $6,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $4,000 * 0.8 = $3,200

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
