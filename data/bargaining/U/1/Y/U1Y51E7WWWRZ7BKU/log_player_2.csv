Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still on the table. This is a fair deal considering the inflation working against you. It's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk losing more in further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
