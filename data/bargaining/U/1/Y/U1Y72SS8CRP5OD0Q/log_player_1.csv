I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, leaving Bob with a very small amount. I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'll reduce my offer slightly, but still maintain a significant advantage.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that rejecting again will likely lead to a worse outcome for him in the following rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999980, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my offer gradually. I believe Bob is playing a risky game, and I want to keep him under pressure.  A larger offer now might be tempting, but it could also signal that I'm willing to concede more, potentially weakening my position in later rounds."

```

I'm continuing to reduce my offer, but now at a slower pace.  We're getting closer to the middle ground, and I want to see if Bob will start to consider accepting.  However, I still want to retain a strong advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999960, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my offer, but slowly. I'm hoping that Bob will see that we are approaching a point where neither of us will get a good deal if we continue to reject each other's offers.  This offer is still heavily in my favor, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 999960 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offers. While we're getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still hoping to get a better deal for myself. With only a few rounds remaining, I need to be strategic to ensure a decent payout."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999950, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only two rounds left, the pressure is mounting. I'm reducing my offer again, but this time to a more substantial amount. I'm hoping that this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong position. If Bob rejects this offer, he risks getting nothing in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 999950 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Although it's still heavily in his favor, it's better than getting nothing at all.  We're very close to the end of the game, and I need to secure some money.  It's a risk, but I believe it's the best option in this situation."
