"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me already!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed towards him. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a slightly better deal, can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is still affecting me, and I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""
}
```"
