"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

This is a relatively fair split, with me getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'd rather get a higher share now. I'll reject Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation is still affecting my gain, I'll aim for an even higher share. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is slightly more generous than his previous one, and considering the inflation, I'll accept this offer.
