"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share this time""}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still being reasonable and leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point. The 42-58 split is still not ideal, but I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't divide the money soon."
