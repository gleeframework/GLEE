Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose that I take $60 and Bob takes $40. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a slight advantage, but Bob still gets a good share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, my money is worth 10% less this round and Bob's is worth 20% less.  It seems unlikely I can get a better offer in the next round.  I'll accept Bob's proposal."
