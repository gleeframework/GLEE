"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer takes nearly all the money for Alice, leaving just $1 for Bob.  While it might seem unfair, it's a strategic move considering Bob's money is worth 5% less each round.  This forces Bob to consider if he's willing to risk losing more money by rejecting this offer and moving on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
