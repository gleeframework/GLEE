Bob is undervaluing the impact of inflation on his end. While his offer is closer to a fair split after inflation, I need to push for a larger gain on my end to compensate for the rapid devaluation."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is unlikely to offer anything better than this at this point. A 50/50 split, even with the inflation disparity, is better than risking getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
