"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for Bob, he's offering me 20 dollars, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer. However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept such a low share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite low, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the money worth 48.8% less for Bob, he's offering me only 25 dollars, which is a significant decrease from my previous offer. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept such a low share.

However, I'm also not sure if I want to reject and risk getting an even lower offer from Bob. Considering the inflation, I think I'll take the 25 dollars.
