"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90% and you get the rest.  We can always adjust it in the next round if you'd prefer something different.

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too one-sided. Let's be more realistic. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  Think carefully, the pot gets smaller next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but 60/40 is still too far off. Let's compromise at 55/45. It's a more balanced split, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
