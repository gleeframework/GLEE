"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money 60/40. This offer won't be as good later due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split the money 60/40 in my favor. After all, I'm the one taking the risk of you rejecting my offer. You already had a chance to accept a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer might seem tempting, it's important to remember that the value of the money decreases for me with each round. Accepting $4,000 now is a bad deal compared to what I could potentially get in future rounds if I play my cards right. I need to incentivize Bob to offer me a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand there's risk for you too. How about a 55/45 split? It's a significant amount for both of us and avoids further losses for me due to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I need to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and move closer to a more even split. 
* **Highlighting Loss Aversion:**  Emphasizing the ""losses"" I'm incurring due to inflation might make my offer more appealing.  
* **Finding a Balance:** This offer is still favorable to me in the long run while hopefully being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
