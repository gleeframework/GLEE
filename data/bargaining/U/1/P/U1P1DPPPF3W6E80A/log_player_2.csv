"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but I'm open to a more even split later. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'll see what Alice proposes next round.  It's too early to settle for such a small share.  Let's see how things play out with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a fair share, considering the inflation factor will start to hit us both soon."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair split given the inflation we're facing. Let's end this before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a fair split, and it avoids further losses due to inflation. Let's take it."
