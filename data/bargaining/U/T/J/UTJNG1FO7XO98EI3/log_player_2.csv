"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more now to account for future inflation, but you still get a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'd like to see what kind of offer Alice will make after seeing that I rejected her first proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's end this game and share the money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! Let's settle this now. I'm taking a smaller cut than my last offer, it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I would prefer more money, the inflation is getting worse, and this is a decent offer considering the circumstances.  It's time to end this game."
