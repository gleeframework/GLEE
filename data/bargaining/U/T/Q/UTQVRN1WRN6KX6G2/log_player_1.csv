"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's better than getting nothing! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm losing value with each round. This offer is fair.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than last round, but I need to secure at least half to make it worth it for me. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate and the value of his gains is decreasing rapidly. While his offer is tempting, I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next couple of rounds.  We're still far from the deadline, and I need to leverage my position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out for both of us.  This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation.  Let's settle this now and both walk away with something.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing value with each round. This is my final offer. Accept it, and we both get something. Reject it, and we risk getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but Bob's tone suggests this is his absolute limit.  While not ideal, accepting ensures I receive something rather than risking nothing in later rounds where his offers may be even worse."
