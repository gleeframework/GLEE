"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This way, I'm leaving him a relatively small amount, but it's still a fair share considering the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll carefully consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'm effectively getting $4,000 ($5,000 / 1.2) if I accept this offer. Considering the next rounds will make the money even scarcer, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
