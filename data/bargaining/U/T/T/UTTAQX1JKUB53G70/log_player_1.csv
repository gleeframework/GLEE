"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and I want to set a good tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,500.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like to get more. Can you offer a bit more?""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and asking Bob to come back with something better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,500, so I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but I'm still willing to meet you halfway!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share, but I think this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% inflation, my gain of $5,500 is now worth $4,012.30.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take it. 7,000 to you is a good deal, and I'll take 3,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finalize the split."
