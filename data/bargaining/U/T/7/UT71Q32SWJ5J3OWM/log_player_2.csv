"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have nothing to lose by waiting. Meanwhile, for Alice, the money loses 10% of its value each round, so she has an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Let's see what she offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not happy with your last offer.  Let's split it 45/55 to be fair. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Given that the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I'm in a stronger negotiating position as the rounds progress. Alice's offer is closer to what I want, but I believe I can get an even better deal if I wait. The fact that Alice is willing to compromise indicates she's aware of the pressure the inflation mechanic puts on her, and I'll leverage that for a potentially better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Given the current inflation, I think this is a reasonable adjustment. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to you, but it remains the same value to me. I'm willing to end this now with this offer.""}"
