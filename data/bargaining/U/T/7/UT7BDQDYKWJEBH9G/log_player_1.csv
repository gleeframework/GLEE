Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, with me taking $9,000 and Bob getting $1,000. It's a pretty aggressive opening offer, but I'm hoping to secure the majority of the money in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this situation. Inflation will only decrease the value of the money further in future rounds, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
