"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but I'm open to negotiations 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is affecting me, and my gain is worth 20% less this round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 40. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is still affecting me, and my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round. I'll try to make a more attractive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'd like to keep a bit more for myself this round""
