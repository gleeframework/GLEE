"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take $90 and leave Bob with $10. This gives me a large share, but it's a starting point to see if Bob will accept. It's important to remember that the money becomes less valuable with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take $10, I'm confident I can do better. I'm going to reject this offer and see what Bob proposes next.  I have 10 more rounds to work with, and I'm not going to settle for such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $80, leaving Bob with $20. This still gives me a significant share, but it might be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer. The inflation is starting to factor in, so it's important to move quickly and find a solution that benefits both of us."

# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While the money I gain is worth more than in the previous round due to Bob's diminishing returns, I'm still not satisfied with this division. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer to 70, giving Bob 30. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation hitting Bob harder with each round. I'm hopeful he'll accept this offer and we can move on before the value of the money diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While the money I gain is worth more than in the previous round due to Bob's diminishing returns, I'm still not satisfied with this division. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds. The inflation is really starting to affect Bob, so I'm going to try and push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer again to 60, giving Bob 40. We're getting closer to a more balanced split, and I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation.  The value of the money is quickly decreasing for Bob, and I need to find a solution that works for both of us before we lose everything."

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

I'm going to propose an even split of $50 each.  The inflation is hitting Bob hard, and I think he'll be motivated to accept a 50/50 split to avoid losing even more value. We are running out of time, so I'm taking a more cooperative approach in hopes of finding a solution before it's too late."
