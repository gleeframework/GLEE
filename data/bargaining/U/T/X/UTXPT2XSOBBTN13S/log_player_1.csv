Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000.  I want to maximize my share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept the offer.  Even with the 5% inflation, I am still gaining $6000, which is more than the $5400 I would have earned if I had rejected Bob's offer and then proposed to give him $1000 in the next round."
