"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly. This way, I minimize the risk of inflation significantly impacting my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better for me than nothing, it's significantly lower than my initial proposal. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm reducing my offer slightly to make it more attractive. I'm hoping that Bob will be less likely to reject this offer, as the risk of inflation continues to increase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my previous proposal, and the inflation is starting to bite. However, I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to maintain a significant share. I'm hoping that Bob will realize the risk of continued inflation and be more willing to accept a deal closer to my proposed split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is better than what Bob offered previously, it's still significantly lower than my previous proposal, and the inflation is seriously impacting my share. I'll hold out for a better deal and see if we can come to a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer once more, but I'm still aiming for a decent share. With inflation continuing to chip away at my potential earnings, I need to find a balance between securing a deal and maximizing my share. Hopefully, Bob will see that the risk of further inflation makes accepting this offer the most sensible choice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than the last round, the inflation is taking a serious toll.  I'm still holding out for a better deal, hoping to get a larger share before the inflation completely devours my potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm making a significant concession here by offering a 50/50 split. With inflation accelerating, I realize that a large share might become unattainable.  This offer is my final attempt to reach an agreement before the value of the money dwindles further."
