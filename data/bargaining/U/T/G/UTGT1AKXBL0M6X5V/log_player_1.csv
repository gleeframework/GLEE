"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can get the game over with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to try to negotiate for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another proposal!

Considering the inflation, I'll try to be more aggressive this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You can't beat this offer, Bob! It's a steal!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bigger share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation has already reduced my potential gain by almost 50% from the original amount. I'd like to try to negotiate for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another proposal!

Considering the inflation, I'll try to be even more aggressive this time. Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob. This is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
