"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to be more careful with my proposal since the money is worth less.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. The offer is closer to 50/50, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its original value, and I need to be cautious about the inflation.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This way, I'm still getting a slight majority, but I'm leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth even less than before, and I need to be even more cautious.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. The offer is still slightly biased towards Bob, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 29.2% of its original value, and I need to be very careful about the inflation.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still getting a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
