"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you'll take 20%""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'd be getting $7,000 (80% of $8,750, which is 90% of $8,000).

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which means I'd get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000. This is a better deal for me than my previous offer, so I'll accept it.
