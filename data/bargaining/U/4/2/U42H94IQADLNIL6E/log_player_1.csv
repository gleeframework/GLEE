"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $1,000,000. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's aim for a more even split this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400000 * 0.8 = 320000
* Bob gain: 600000 * 0.8 = 480000

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my negotiating skills.""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to 55% of the (inflated) $800,000, which is 440,000 in real value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We're losing money with each round, and a fair split seems like the best solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 500000 * 0.5162 = 258.1k
* Bob gain: 500000 * 0.5162 = 258.1k

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4. It seems like we're getting closer to a fair split, and continuing to negotiate might not be worth the loss of value due to inflation.
