Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out. 70 for me, 30 for you. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's think about why this is a good move. Bob's offer is getting worse, and it's better to negotiate for a larger share, even if it means waiting another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer - 55 for me, 45 for you.  Take it or leave it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're entering Round 3, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us.  I need to apply more pressure to get Bob to settle.
* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my demand slightly from 60 to 55, making it seem like I'm compromising. However, this is still a better deal for me than Bob's previous offer.
* **Ultimatum:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping Bob will perceive the risk of further negotiation and accept before the money is worth even less."
