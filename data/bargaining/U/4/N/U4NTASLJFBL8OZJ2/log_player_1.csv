"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can have 60. It's a good deal, don't pass it up! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 40 units of money that are worth 90% of the original value. That's equivalent to 36 units of the original value.

Considering the offer, I think it's not bad, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still holding out for more. Take it or leave it!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is slightly more favorable to Bob than his previous offer. Let's see if he'll take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings!

Considering the new values, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 30 units of money that are worth 72.9% of the original value. That's equivalent to 23.07 units of the original value.

While it's not a great deal, I'm running out of time and options. I'll accept this offer to avoid getting nothing.
