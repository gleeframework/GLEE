Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overcomplicate things!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's take more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll accept this offer for now.
