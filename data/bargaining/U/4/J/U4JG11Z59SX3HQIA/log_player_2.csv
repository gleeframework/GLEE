"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal that gives us both a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Your previous offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice.  This is more balanced considering the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still generous considering the inflation is hitting me harder. Let's close this deal and both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though the offer on the surface remains the same, the time pressure is increasing. It's still beneficial for me to hold out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  The inflation is hurting both of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to meet you halfway. This offer is a compromise, and it's the best you'll get considering the inflation is working against me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is unlikely to offer anything better than this.  Taking the deal now locks in a reasonable gain before inflation eats away at it further."
