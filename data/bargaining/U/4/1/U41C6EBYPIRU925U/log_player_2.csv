While $1,000 is a decent starting point, it's worth trying to get a better deal. I can afford to reject and see what Alice offers next."

Alice is moving in the right direction, but I'm still hoping for a better split.  With the inflation, I can't afford to settle for such a small share. I'll see if she'll budge further in the next round."
