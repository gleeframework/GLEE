"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money I'll gain.

However, I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, as it seems a bit skewed in Bob's favor. I was hoping for a more even split.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation effect on Bob's share, I'll have to consider the reduced value of his gain.

However, I'm not sure if 52-48 is a good enough compromise, considering the initial 50-50 split. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to push for a better deal. Considering the significant inflation effect on Bob's share, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation's impact on you""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect being so severe on Bob's share, I'm starting to think that he's getting desperate. I'll consider his offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the remaining 2% difference.

However, since I'm getting a larger share, I'll accept this offer.
