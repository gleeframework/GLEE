"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a better deal than my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
