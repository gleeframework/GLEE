**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to frame her offer as a compromise, it's important to remember that time is on my side. Her share is rapidly decreasing in value. I need to hold firm to encourage her to make a better offer before the remaining rounds dwindle."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This is the most straightforward deal, and frankly, you're running out of time to make a better offer."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation significantly more than Bob. Offering a 50/50 split now might seem generous to her, given that her potential gains are rapidly decreasing.
* **Simplicity:** An even split is the easiest to agree on.  By removing the negotiation aspect, Bob increases the chance of Alice accepting before her position weakens further. 
* **Slight Edge:**  While Bob has conceded some in this offer, it's still a better outcome for him than accepting Alice's previous offer.  He's banking on the time pressure swaying her decision."
