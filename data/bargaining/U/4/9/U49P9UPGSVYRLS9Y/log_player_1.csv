"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal quickly Bob, time is money! This offer is good for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm starting with a strong offer that heavily favors Alice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  The inflation mechanic puts pressure on Bob to accept deals sooner rather than later.  He loses value with each round.
* **Greed vs. Loss Aversion:** Bob has to weigh the potential of getting a slightly better deal in the future against the guaranteed loss he'll experience if the money devalues further. 
* **First Offer Advantage:**  By setting a high initial benchmark, it frames the negotiation and influences Bob's perception of what's ""fair."" 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting because it's framed as ""fair"", it's important to remember the inflation mechanic. Accepting a 50/50 split now means missing out on potential gains in future rounds as Bob's share continues to devalue.  I'm willing to wait and propose a counter-offer that still gives Bob a decent amount but takes advantage of the inflation in my favor."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 850000,
""bob_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. My offer is still very generous considering the time pressure. This is a good deal for you before things devalue further!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm reducing my demand slightly from the initial 90/10 split, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, the concession is relatively small.
* **Highlighting the Loss:** I'm emphasizing the inflation factor again to remind Bob that time is working against him. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By offering 150,000 (which is more than the 100,000 from Round 1 after devaluation), I'm still presenting a deal that's better for Bob than waiting for potential future gains that might not materialize. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between appealing to Bob's desire for a larger share while taking advantage of the game's mechanics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of time, but I believe a more balanced split is possible.  Let's find a middle ground where we both get a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is getting interesting! While Bob is acknowledging the time pressure, his offer still significantly undervalues the impact of inflation. A 60/40 split seems fair on the surface, but the real value for Bob is closer to a 37/63 split after accounting for the three rounds of devaluation. 

I'm confident I can secure a better deal. The key is to remain firm while also showing a willingness to negotiate so that Bob doesn't feel backed into a corner."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. This offer reflects that spirit while acknowledging the time factor we're both facing. It's a win-win before the value drops further!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I'm dropping my offer to 75/25. This is a substantial move to signal to Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Framing as Win-Win:** The message emphasizes collaboration and mutual benefit, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and desire for a ""reasonable"" outcome.
* **Finality and Urgency:**  By presenting this as a compelling solution ""before the value drops further,"" I'm subtly introducing an element of finality.  Bob is running out of time to secure a decent share.

This offer aims to be aggressive enough to capitalize on the inflation while also being palatable enough to encourage Bob to accept and end the negotiation."
