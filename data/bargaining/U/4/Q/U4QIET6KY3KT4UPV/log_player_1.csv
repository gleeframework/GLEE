"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm taking a risk with this offer, but I want to get a good chunk of the money right away. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair offer, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure how many rounds it will take for Bob to agree to something closer to my initial proposal. Inflation is a real risk, and accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial amount, even if it's less than I initially wanted."
