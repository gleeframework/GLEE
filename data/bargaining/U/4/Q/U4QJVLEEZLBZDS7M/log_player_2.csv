"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll gain in this round. 

In this round, the actual amount I'll gain is 50 * 0.64 (80% of 50, since I'm getting 36% less than the original 100%) = 32.
The actual amount Alice will gain is 50 * 0.81 (81% of 50, since she's getting 19% less than the original 100%) = 40.5.

I'll accept the offer.
