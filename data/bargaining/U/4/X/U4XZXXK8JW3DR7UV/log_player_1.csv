"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a decent chunk, but don't expect to get away with too much!""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $320,000 (0.8 x $400,000).

I'll consider Bob's offer and respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
