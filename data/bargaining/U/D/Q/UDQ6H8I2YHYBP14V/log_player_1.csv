```

  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end the game now!""

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. While Bob's offer is still not ideal, it's a better split than the 50/50 I initially proposed. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risk of potentially getting a worse deal in future rounds.

I'll decide to:

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
