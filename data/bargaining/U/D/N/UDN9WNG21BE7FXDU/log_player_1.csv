"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly proposal to end the game early with a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5000
* Bob gain: $5000

I'm not thrilled about this proposal, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
