Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a little more, but I still can't do 50/50 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for Bob with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently rejected offers approaching a 50/50 split.  It's unlikely she'll concede much more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer risks getting a worse deal in later rounds. Accepting secures a less than ideal, but still reasonable, amount."
