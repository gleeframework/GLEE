```

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding Inflation:**  It's crucial to realize that with each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both of us, but more aggressively for me. 
* **Alice's Declining Advantage:** While Alice benefits more from waiting (her inflation is lower), her advantage shrinks each round. 
* **Balancing Fairness and Urgency:** My offer is a bit more aggressive than a simple 50/50 split, reflecting the urgency to settle due to my higher inflation rate. However, it's still significantly better for Alice than if she waits for another round. 

This offer attempts to balance a sense of fairness with the understanding that delaying the decision hurts both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation, this might be the best deal for both. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:** The inflation has taken a considerable chunk out of the potential gains. My share is worth almost 20% less than in Round 1.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could hold out hoping for a better offer in Round 4, the inflation means even a slightly better split might not be worth the loss in value.
* **Alice's Calculated Offer:** Alice's offer, while still favoring her, recognizes the impact of inflation. It's unlikely she'll go much lower in subsequent rounds.

It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting now cuts potential losses from further inflation."
