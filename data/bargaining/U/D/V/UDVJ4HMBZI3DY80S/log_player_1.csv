"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. 55/45 split seems reasonable.  This way, we both get a good share, and we don't have to go through more rounds where the money loses value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
