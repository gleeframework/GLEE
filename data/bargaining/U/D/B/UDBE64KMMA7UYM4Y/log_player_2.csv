"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to be greedy.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering your offer was a bit one-sided. Let's see what you think!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you most of it, but I need something too 
# Bob gain: 7200 
# Alice gain: 2800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still like more, the inflation is starting to hurt, and this is a much better deal than my last offer."
