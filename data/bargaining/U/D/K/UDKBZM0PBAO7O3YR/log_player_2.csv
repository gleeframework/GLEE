"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I propose 6000 for me and 4000 for you.  It's important to reach an agreement quickly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's risky to accept the first offer, even though it seems fair. I'll try to get a better deal since inflation hurts me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I think a 65/35 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's move quickly to avoid losing money!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle with 5500 for me and 4500 for you.  Time is ticking, and we both lose if we can't agree. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping for a better deal. Although time is running out, I can still get more than 4500 in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly this time. It's the fairest option, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. What do you say?""}
