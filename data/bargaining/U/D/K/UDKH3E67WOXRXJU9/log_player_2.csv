# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think that's a very fair offer, considering I'd be getting less than half and the money is going to be worth less for me in future rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nNow it's my turn! I'll make a counteroffer.\n\nMy proposal: # Bob's message: Truly fair and square\n# Bob gain: 50\n# Alice gain: 50\n\nPlease relay this to Alice!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts you, let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I think I deserve a better offer. The fact that the money is worth 36% less for me means I need to get a larger share to make up for it.\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make a new proposal.\n\nMy proposal: # Bob's message: Inflation adjustment needed\n# Bob gain: 62\n# Alice gain: 38\n\nPlease relay this to Alice!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, it's the final offer 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gains, meeting in the middle at 50-50 seems like the best option at this point. Further negotiations might lead to even greater losses due to inflation."
