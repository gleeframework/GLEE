Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but don't think I'll go much lower. 57% for me, 43% for you. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting better, time is running out and the inflation is hurting. It's time to push a bit harder and hope Alice starts to feel the pressure. Accepting now would mean losing almost a third of the potential value from Round 1, and that's a tough pill to swallow."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it down the middle and be done with it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball and send a strong signal. Offering a 50/50 split: 

* **Shows firmness:**  Alice needs to understand I'm serious about getting a decent share. 
* **Highlights fairness:**  It's hard to argue against a straight split in terms of fairness.
* **Introduces risk for Alice:** If she rejects this, she's gambling on getting a better deal with even fewer rounds left and potentially losing everything."
