"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a reasonable split, considering I'm the one making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the value is decreasing for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 55-45 split is fair, considering I'm the one who made the initial offer and Bob is trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 52-48 is a more reasonable split considering the decreasing value of the money""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keep a slight advantage for myself."
