# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice's offer is closer to a fair split, I still think I can get a better deal considering the inflation is affecting Alice's gains more than mine. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."

# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation is significantly affecting Alice's gains, I think this offer is a good compromise.
