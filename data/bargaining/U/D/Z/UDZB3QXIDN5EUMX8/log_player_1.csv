Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly.  I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, but it's not there yet."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than before. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

This offer is still not good for Alice. Bob is being stubborn, but it's better to hold out for a more favorable split. With each round, the value of Bob's potential gain decreases for him, making him more likely to accept a fairer offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the difference from the last offer. This is my final offer.  Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

This is a tricky situation. Bob is becoming more aggressive, but his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. It's risky, but rejecting might be the only way to get Bob to consider a fairer deal.  The inflation is working in Alice's favor."
