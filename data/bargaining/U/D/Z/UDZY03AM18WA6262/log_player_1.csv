"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm proposing to keep the majority of the money for myself, but offering Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  This is a risky strategy, but I believe it's the best way to secure a significant portion of the money in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more favorable to him. Since there are still many rounds left and the inflation is only affecting me, it's better to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm reducing my proposed gain slightly to reflect the inflation, but still offering Bob a substantial amount. This is a compromise that could potentially be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer, especially considering the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting me hard, and it's clear that Bob is going to keep pushing for more. While I'd like to hold out for a better deal, the risk of getting nothing at the end is too high. Accepting this offer ensures I get some money, even though it's significantly less than what I initially wanted."
