Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution.  I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  I'm hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a classic game theory scenario. While Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous one, it's still not a good deal for me.  There's plenty of time left and I can likely get a better deal by continuing to play. I'll reject and force Bob to make another offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to decrease my share a bit, but still try to get a majority.  I'm aiming to find a point where Bob might be tempted to accept, knowing that he'll get a slightly lower share every round.  Let's see if this works!"
