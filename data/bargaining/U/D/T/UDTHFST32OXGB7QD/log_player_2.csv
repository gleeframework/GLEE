Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take a smaller cut than my initial offer to speed things up. This deal makes sense considering the value decrease for you.

# Alice gain: 5500
