Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to a 60/40 split.  The longer she waits, the more tempting Bob's offers will become as the actual value decreases. Bob needs to hold firm and not show desperation, aiming for a slightly better deal than this."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Alice. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. Take it or leave it."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are now past the halfway point.  The pressure is mounting, and it's vital to convey a sense of urgency. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  The 50/50 split is the most logical and fair offer. By framing it as ""take it or leave it,"" Bob asserts confidence in his position without seeming overly aggressive.
* **Psychological Factor:** This offer might make Alice realize that her stubbornness is counterproductive.  She may be more likely to accept a less favorable deal now than she would have been in earlier rounds."
