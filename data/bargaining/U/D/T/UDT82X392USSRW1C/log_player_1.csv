"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm going to offer Bob a small share to see if he's willing to accept it early on.  I'm hoping he'll be happy with a little something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in so easily. I'll keep fighting for a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to increase my offer a bit, but still keep a majority share. I'm hoping Bob sees that it's in his best interest to accept now before inflation eats away at his potential gains too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not convinced by Bob's offer. He's being too greedy, and inflation is starting to hit him harder than me. I'll keep trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share, but still maintain a significant advantage. The inflation is starting to impact him significantly, and I believe he might start to see the value in accepting a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting better, but it's still not enough. He's getting desperate, but I'm holding out for a fairer split. The inflation is hurting him more than me, so I have the upper hand here."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share again, recognizing that inflation is hitting him hard. However, I'm still holding onto a majority share, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob is offering a significant portion of the money, I'm still going to reject his offer. Inflation is hitting him very hard, and he's becoming increasingly desperate. I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're nearing the end of the game, and both of us are suffering from inflation. I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equitable solution.  I believe it's in Bob's best interest to accept this, as further rounds will only hurt him more."
