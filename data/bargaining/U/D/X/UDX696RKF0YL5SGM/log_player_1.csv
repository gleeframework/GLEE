"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit unbalanced, Alice. Let's go for a fair 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""How about we meet in the middle, Bob? 55/45 is a decent compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, Alice. I'm offering a 52/48 split - slightly better for me, but we both lose if this fails. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Although not ideal, accepting a 48/52 split is better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds due to inflation.  The deal is no longer advantageous, but it's crucial to secure something before the value diminishes further."
