"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $1000 and keep $9000.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more for being the one making the offer this round 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I need to adjust my expectations. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think you're being a bit too greedy, Bob. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money is worth less now. I'll wait for a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Take $3000 and let me have $7000.""
}
```

This way, I'm still getting a decent chunk, but I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share than last time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, Alice. Let's split it 50/50 this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, a 50/50 split seems reasonable. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you've convinced me. 50/50 it is!""
}
```

I think we've reached a fair agreement."
