"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% and take the rest. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about whether 20% is a good deal.

For now, I'll reject the offer and hope to do better in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too generous to him, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give away the whole farm. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep a significant portion for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more. You can try to do better. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is even more unappealing now.

However, I'll try to hold on to what little I can. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will make a better offer in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
