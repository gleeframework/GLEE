"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, but you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While getting $1000 is better than nothing, waiting a few rounds will significantly change the dynamic in my favor due to the inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer ensures you get a good deal now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking Advantage of Inflation:**  By round 2, the value of the money has already decreased. It's crucial to secure a favorable split quickly.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering Alice $4000 might seem generous, but it's actually a smart move. It gives the impression of fairness while capitalizing on the time pressure and differing inflation rates. 
* **Strong Opening Position:** This offer establishes a baseline for negotiation. Even if Alice rejects it, I'm in a stronger position for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a more even split. Let's settle before the inflation hurts us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, which benefits me. Her offer is better, but the inflation is working significantly in my favor now. There's still room for improvement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is becoming a significant factor. It's crucial to apply pressure now.
* **Strategic Bluff:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to push Alice into accepting. The message implies I'm unwilling to negotiate further, even though there are still rounds left.
* **Favorable Split:**  Even with the inflation, securing $6500 at this stage is a good outcome. It reflects a strong position in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Dynamics:** While I was aiming for a larger share, the increasing inflation rate is significantly eating into my potential gains.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer in hopes of getting a slightly better deal in later rounds is too risky now. The inflation could mean any future gains are negligible.
* **Guaranteed Payout:** Accepting a 50/50 split at this stage ensures a reasonable payout. It's better to take a sure thing than gamble and potentially end up with nothing."
