Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, don't you?

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a generous offer. Take it before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm still losing a significant amount, accepting this offer is better than potentially getting nothing if I continue to reject and the inflation continues to eat away at my gains."
