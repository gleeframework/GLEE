"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. I think this is a fair deal, considering the inflation rates. If Bob accepts, we can both walk away with a decent amount of money. If he declines, I'll have to adjust my offer in the next round to account for the decreasing value of the money. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! 60-40 in my favor seems fair to me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept Bob's offer, as it's essentially the opposite of what I proposed in the first round. Considering the inflation rates, accepting this offer would mean I'd be getting a significantly worse deal than what I initially proposed. I'll have to come up with a new proposal in the next round to try and find a middle ground. The game is on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 58-42 is a compromise!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself. I've decreased my initial offer by $200 to try and find a middle ground with Bob. Considering the inflation rates, I think this is a reasonable compromise. If Bob accepts, we can both still walk away with a decent amount of money. If he declines, I'll have to adjust my offer again in the next round. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to budge a bit, but I still think 65-35 is a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept Bob's offer, as it's still heavily skewed in his favor. Although he's budged a bit, the 65-35 split is not appealing to me, especially considering the inflation rates. The money I'd gain is already worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and accepting this offer would mean I'd be getting a relatively small share of the remaining value. I'll have to come up with a new proposal in the next round to try and find a more balanced deal. The game continues!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Come on, Bob, 56-44 is a fair compromise considering the inflation!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4400 and keep $5600 for myself. I've decreased my previous offer by $200 to try and find a more balanced deal. The inflation rates are taking a toll on both of us, but I think this split is reasonable. If Bob accepts, we can both still walk away with a decent amount of money. If he declines, I'll have to adjust my offer again in the next round. Let's see what Bob says!"
