"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, reflecting my role in the next round's proposal. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 55/45 split. I think it's a bit too skewed in your favor, especially considering I was willing to start with a fair split in the first round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway between the original fair split and your previous offer. Let's try to find a compromise, Bob.""
