"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a good chunk. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is tempting, it's very risky to accept so early in the game. I need more information about the specifics of the offer and how the money will be divided.  I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and we can negotiate further in future rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too far off. Let's split it 70/30 in my favor. It's a better deal than your last offer, and we can keep negotiating. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 70/30 split is closer to what I would like, it's still too lopsided in Alice's favor.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'll see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away with a significant amount.  We're both losing value with each passing round, so let's find a resolution.""
