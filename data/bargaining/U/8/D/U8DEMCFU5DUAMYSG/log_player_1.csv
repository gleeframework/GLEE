Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you still have to make a concession 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $3600. Bob's gain of $6000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4800.

Considering this, I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. I'd like a slightly better deal, but I'm not sure if I want to push it further.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.
