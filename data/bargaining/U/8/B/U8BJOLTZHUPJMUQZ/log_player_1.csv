"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that appeals to Bob's sense of fairness. Since there's no inflation in the first round, I can make a relatively bold offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this proposal rather than risking a worse offer in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less to me now, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Since Bob is not affected by inflation, he may be willing to make concessions to end the game sooner rather than later. I'll try to take advantage of this and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n### In this round, I'll offer a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. Considering the inflation, this offer is more generous than my initial proposal. By suggesting that we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and fairness. Since the money is worth even less to me now, I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiations."
