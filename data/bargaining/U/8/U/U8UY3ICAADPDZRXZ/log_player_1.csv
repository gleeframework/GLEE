"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 70, you can take 30. Let's end the game here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial 100$ and Bob 30%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you give me 60. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual value of the 40$ I would receive is 40 * 0.8 = 32$.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not enough for me, I want more. The value of 40$ is only 32$ due to inflation, I need more to account for the loss of purchasing power.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the loss of value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55, you take 45. I need to make up for the inflation, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. 50-50 is fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, the actual value of the 50$ I would receive is 50 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 25.8$.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if 50-50 is fair considering the inflation. I'd rather not settle for 25.8$. I need a higher share to make up for the loss of value.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll aim to get an even higher share to compensate for the loss of value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 65, you take 35. I need to make up for the cumulative inflation, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```"
