"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of $400,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a bit lower than my initial proposal. However, it's still a decent compromise. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my share is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). So, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share.""
}
```"
