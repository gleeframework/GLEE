6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6000, you get $4000.  This gives you a decent share and avoids the risk of us both getting nothing if we wait too long.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's each take a little less risk and go with $5500 for me and $4500 for you.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6400.0,3600.0,"Bob, that's not really an even split considering the money is losing value for both of us, especially you. I'm offering $6400 for me and $3600 for you. Let's be realistic, we both lose if this drags on.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
6000.0,4000.0,I'm willing to split the difference from your last offer.  Let's call it $4000 for me and $6000 for you.  This way we both get a decent amount and avoid the risk of losing everything.,Bob,4,
