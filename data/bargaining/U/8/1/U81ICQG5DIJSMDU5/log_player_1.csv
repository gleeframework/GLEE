"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. This split is more fair given the inflation difference.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

However, Bob's offer seems reasonable considering the inflation difference. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
