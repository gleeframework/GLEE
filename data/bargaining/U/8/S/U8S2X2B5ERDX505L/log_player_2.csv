"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept this and we can call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go any higher! 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like more, given the inflation and the potential for further rounds, accepting this seems like the best choice."
