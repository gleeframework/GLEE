"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 3:1 split. I think I deserve a better deal, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 375000, ""bob_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to compromise too much. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob than my initial 50/50 split."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really unhappy with this offer. The inflation has already taken a significant toll on my potential gain, and now Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. I think I deserve a much better deal, especially considering I'm getting a much smaller share than before. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

I'm willing to give Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to protect my own interests. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob than my previous ones."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. The inflation has already taken a huge toll on my potential gain, and now Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. I think I deserve a much better deal, especially considering I'm getting a tiny share. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

I'm willing to give up my share and let Bob take the entire sum, but only if he agrees to split the remaining rounds' inflation equally. This way, I'll at least get a fair deal in the long run."
