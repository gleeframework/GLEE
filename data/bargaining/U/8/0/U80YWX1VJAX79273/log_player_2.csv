"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive losses from inflation. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While a 60/40 split might seem fair on the surface, the inflation rates are drastically different for Bob and Alice.  Bob only loses 10% of his value per round, while Alice loses 20%. This means that rejecting the offer and forcing Alice to make a proposal in the next round could lead to a more favorable outcome for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be strategic. While I understand your desire for a larger share, the inflation rate is hurting you more than me.  A 60/40 split in my favor is more sustainable given the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right that inflation is a factor, but so is fairness.  I'm willing to compromise slightly - let's do a 55/45 split in my favor to settle this before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
Alice's offer is more advantageous than the previous round's offer. While she still receives a larger share, the 55/45 split allows for a more balanced outcome. The inflation rate is affecting both of us significantly, and accepting this offer ensures that we both receive a reasonable amount before the value of the money further diminishes."
