Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can agree on a 95/5 split.  Since the money is losing value for you faster, I'm willing to be generous and take the larger share. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
