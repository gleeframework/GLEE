"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. My message to Bob is to try to get him to accept a relatively small amount to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 90% this round, but we can be more even in the future. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not too thrilled about giving Bob 90% of the remaining amount, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $100,000 this round."
