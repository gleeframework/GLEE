"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be efficient, Bob. This offer saves us both time and maximizes our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split! While I want to be efficient, I also want a fair share of the money. Let's see if we can negotiate something better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. I'm proposing a more balanced split that reflects the value we both bring to the table."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is ticking. This offer is still generous, but the clock is working against us both. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not a fair deal. The decreasing value for her doesn't change the fact that a more equitable split is possible. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept an unbalanced offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this offer ensures a significant gain for both of us, even considering the inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a win-win here. This offer ensures a good outcome for both of us. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential profits. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting frustrating, Alice! I'm trying to be fair, but constantly lowballing me isn't a good strategy.  I'm starting to doubt your commitment to a ""win-win"".  Let's stop wasting time and get serious about a fair split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering a compromise. This split ensures a good deal for both of us, especially considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's be reasonable and close this deal."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.  It's more than fair, and we're running out of time! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is cutting it close, and it's less than I believe I deserve, but accepting is the most logical choice at this point.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome, and I'd rather secure something than risk losing it all."
