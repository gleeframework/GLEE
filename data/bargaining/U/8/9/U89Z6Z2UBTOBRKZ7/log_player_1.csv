"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You go first next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a hint that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also setting the stage for Bob to make the next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 450,000 * 0.9 = 405,000
* Bob's gain: 550,000

I'm not sure if I like this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway this time. Let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50-50 split, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game."
