I'm going to keep rejecting these offers. The inflation is making it hard for Bob to offer a good deal, but I believe I can still do better.  I'll wait to see what he proposes in the next round."

I'm going to stick with a high offer.  It's clear that Bob is feeling the pressure of the inflation, and I'm sure he's getting desperate to close this out before he loses everything.  I'm confident this offer will finally sway him."
