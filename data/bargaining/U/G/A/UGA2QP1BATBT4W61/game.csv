4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  This is fairer and still leaves us both with a good amount before inflation eats away at it further.",Bob,2,

7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Let's split it 70/30 this time.  It's a more even split than before, and we can both get more money this way before inflation kicks in again.",Alice,3,
