"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a generous offer considering the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'd be getting $63 (70 x 0.9).

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $50, which is actually a better deal for me in terms of real value. I'll accept this offer.
