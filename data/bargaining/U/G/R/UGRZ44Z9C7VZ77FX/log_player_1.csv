"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the initial 100$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn was generous, now it's my turn to be fair. But I can do better 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 45$ (90% of 50$).

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 50$ or 40$ due to inflation, but I'll assume it's 40$ for now.

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
