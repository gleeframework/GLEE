"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer isn't fair to me in the long run. While getting $4000 now seems okay, Alice is getting a much larger share, and the money will be worth less for her in future rounds due to inflation. I need to aim for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this split is more equitable considering the inflation. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to pull a fast one! While she mentions inflation, the offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold firm and aim for a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a good compromise that acknowledges the inflation factor. Let's be reasonable and close the deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering the time pressure and inflation 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting frustrating.  While Alice acknowledges the time pressure and inflation, her idea of ""meeting in the middle"" is still heavily skewed towards her.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a fair deal, and fast."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than fair considering the lost value for you with each round. Take it or leave it - we need to decide NOW.""
