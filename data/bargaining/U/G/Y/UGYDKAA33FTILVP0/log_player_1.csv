Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a deal, Alice. I understand you want to be fair, but I'm losing money each round. How about a slightly better split for me this time? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
