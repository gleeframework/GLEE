"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000. Since we're in the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet. I'm aiming for a relatively even split to start with, hoping Bob will see the fairness in the offer and accept it to avoid further devaluation in the next rounds. The message ""Let's be fair"" is meant to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money's value decreases with each round, accepting 45% of the original amount in the second round doesn't seem advantageous to me. Given the inflation rates, I believe I can potentially get a better deal in subsequent rounds, especially considering Bob's higher inflation rate. I'll take the risk of proceeding to the next round, hoping to leverage the increasing devaluation of the money to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's compromise""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $450,000 and proposing to take $550,000 for myself. Given that we're now in the third round and the money's value has decreased, I'm trying to find a middle ground that might appeal to Bob, considering his higher inflation rate. The message ""Considering inflation, let's compromise"" aims to highlight the impact of inflation on our negotiations and encourage Bob to accept this offer before the money loses even more value in the next rounds."
