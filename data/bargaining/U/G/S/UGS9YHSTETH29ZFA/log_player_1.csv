I'm going to propose a very uneven split in my favor. I know Bob will likely reject this, but it establishes a clear baseline for me and allows me to see how he values the money.  Since inflation affects him more than me, I'm going to try to take advantage of that in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to play the same game as me! I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's more favorable to me than my last offer, the inflation means the money is worth less. I can push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to decrease my offer slightly from the first round, but still keep it heavily in my favor. I want to see if I can get Bob to accept something closer to my initial proposal. The inflation is starting to work in my favor now, so I can afford to be a little less generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit better than my last offer, but it's still not great. The inflation is hurting Bob a lot more than me, and I think I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject and see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but I'm not going to go too low.  Bob's offer last round was surprisingly generous, so I want to see if I can meet him in the middle a bit, while still taking advantage of the inflation working in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer isn't fantastic, the inflation is really starting to hurt him more than me.  If I reject, he's going to be in a really bad spot in the next round. It's time to take what I can get and end this game."
