"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent chunk!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $8,000 I would gain in the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's now worth $7,600.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable proposal. I'll accept it.
