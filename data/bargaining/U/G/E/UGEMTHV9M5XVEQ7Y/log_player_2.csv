Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still feeling generous, but I need a bigger share to make this worth it for me.  Let's work together to find a fair compromise.

# Alice gain: 900000

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out and the value is decreasing.  I'm sticking with a more than fair offer. 60/40.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round. Let's cut our losses and split it 80/20.  It's the best deal we'll get at this point. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on and the deal is getting worse, accepting only 20% when I started with the possibility of getting 60% is too big of a loss.  Alice knows the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing for me. I need to hold strong for another round or two to see if she'll budge closer to a 70/30 or at the absolute worst 65/35 split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a compromise to get this deal done. 55/45. Don't let greed get in the way of us both benefiting.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are getting closer to the end, and both of us are losing value.  Let's split it 70/30 and end this now.  It's the best option for both of us at this point. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** It's painful to accept less than half, but Alice has been stubbornly consistent in wanting a 70/30 split. With each round, the deal is getting worse for me due to inflation. Accepting now secures a reasonable sum, whereas continued rejection risks getting nothing at all if we fail to reach an agreement."
