"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, given the time constraints.  Let's settle this before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I understand the time pressure, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me. This is my compromise.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out. I'm willing to stick with my previous offer. Let's not let this valuable opportunity slip away. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value for me is decreasing, accepting a 40/60 split in Bob's favor sets a bad precedent and significantly undervalues my position. There's still time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair 50/50 split. Let's end this now before inflation eats away at the value any further. A deal is better than no deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value decreases significantly for me. It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:** Offering a 50/50 split highlights that I'm aiming for a fair and equitable outcome. This can encourage Bob to be more agreeable.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  While I want a better deal, continuing to reject offers could lead to both of us getting nothing. A 50/50 split guarantees at least some gain."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer to the end.  This is my final offer. Let's not let the money disappear altogether. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but here's why I'm accepting:

* **Rapidly Decreasing Value:** The value of the money is dropping fast for me. Waiting any longer will result in an even worse deal.
* **Finality of Bob's Offer:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer. Holding out further is unlikely to yield a better outcome. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Accepting a 40/60 split, while not ideal, is still better than getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
