"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiation.""

This way, we both get $5,000 and can call it a day."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

```
{
