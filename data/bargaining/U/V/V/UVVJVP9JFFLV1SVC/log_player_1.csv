"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

Considering the inflation effect, the actual amount I would gain is 4000 * 0.95 = 3800.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a slightly better split, considering the inflation. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Can you consider this compromise?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better offer, but I think this is as high as I can go considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 14.26% less than the original, the actual amount I would gain is 3500 * 0.854 (1 - 0.1426) = 2993.5.

I'm not thrilled about the 35-65 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation has taken a bigger bite out of the money. Can you meet me at 45%?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 86.54% of its original value, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4300,
  ""bob_gain"": 5700,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle?""
