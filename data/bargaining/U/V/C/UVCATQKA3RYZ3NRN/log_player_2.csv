Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer. Considering the increasing inflation impact on you, I'll make a slight concession. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making small concessions, the rapidly increasing inflation for Bob means he needs to push for a better deal. Accepting now would lock him into a significantly disadvantaged outcome due to the inflation disparity."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the inflation is eating away at any potential gains. This is my final offer - let's be reasonable and close this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on. Bob needs to convey a sense of urgency to encourage Alice to settle.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is his ""final offer"", Bob signals he's serious and unlikely to budge much further. 
* **Inflation Factor:**  While 48/52 isn't ideal considering the initial inflation disparity, waiting longer could lead to even worse outcomes for Bob if they fail to reach an agreement."
