I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything.  I'm assuming Bob doesn't know about the inflation, so I'll give him a tiny amount and hope he accepts it.  If not, we'll see what happens in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though Bob is getting a much larger share, it's still a significant amount of money for me.  Since I don't know how inflation will impact him in future rounds, it's better to take the guaranteed 400,000 now."
