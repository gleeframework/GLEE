"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. While Alice's offer seems decent at first glance, I'm willing to bet she'll be more generous as the rounds progress and the value of the money decreases faster for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be reasonable, Alice, but let's make it a bit more even. This deal considers the time pressure we both face.""} 
``` 

Let's see if Alice takes the bait. This offer is still slightly in her favor, but the shrinking pot should encourage her to accept a more balanced deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is a slight improvement on my previous offer and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, but she's still trying to take the lion's share.  I'm betting she'll crack before I do.  Let's see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. It's the fourth round, and this is the only fair deal. Take it or leave it.""}
```

I'm calling Alice's bluff. The pressure is mounting, and a 50/50 split is the most logical outcome. By now, she should realize that trying to squeeze me will likely result in us both walking away with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's more than fair considering the time pressure and the fact that inflation affects me more.  Let's close this deal and both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. This is as good as it's going to get.  The longer this drags on, the less we both get.  Taking the slightly smaller portion now is better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
