"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20 to get started""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial 100$ (80$) and Bob will get 20% (20$)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'll try to do better 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than the initial 80$, which is 76$. Bob's gain is worth 20% less than the initial 20$, which is 16$. 

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer. 

In this round, my gain will be worth 5% less than the previous round's gain, which is 76% of 76, so I'll offer 57.6$. Bob's gain will be worth 20% less than the previous round's gain, which is 16% of 80, so he'll get 12.8$. 

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 57.6,
  ""bob_gain"": 42.4,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a deal, Bob!""
}
```"
