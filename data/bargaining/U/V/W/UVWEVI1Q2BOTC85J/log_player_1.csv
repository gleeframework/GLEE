"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in favor of Bob, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a more balanced starting point. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 gain in the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'd get 90% of $8,000, which is $7,200. But since the money is now worth 10% less, I'll consider the new values.

Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, which is a significant increase from his initial 25% gain. Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
