Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, leaving just $1,000 for Bob. I'm hoping that he'll be desperate enough to accept it in the first round, even though it's not a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a much fairer offer than the first round, and the inflation doesn't really affect me in this round. Accepting this offer means I get a good amount of money, and the game is over."
