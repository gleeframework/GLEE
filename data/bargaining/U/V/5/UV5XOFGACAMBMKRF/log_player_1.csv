This is my first offer. I'm going for a high share, but I'm also leaving something for Bob to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer was for him. I will reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  Since Bob rejected my first offer, I assume he wants a larger share. Hopefully, this compromise will be enough to get the game over."
