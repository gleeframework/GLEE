"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose to keep $99 and give Bob $1. This is a very generous offer for Bob, and I think he should accept it. It's better for him to get $1 than nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
