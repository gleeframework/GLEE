Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with something. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is worse for me than my original offer, and the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly, but still keeping a majority share.  It's important to keep in mind that the money is losing value with each round, so a quick agreement is beneficial for both of us."

# Alice gain: 4500

Bob's offer is still worse than my previous offer, and the money is worth significantly less now. I'll reject this and try to make a counter offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a majority share.  Each round the value of the money decreases, so it's important to reach an agreement soon."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse, and the value of the money is dropping fast. I'm not going to accept this offer.  It's time to make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm proposing an even split. This is a fair deal, and given the rapid decline in value, it's the best chance for both of us to get a decent amount."
