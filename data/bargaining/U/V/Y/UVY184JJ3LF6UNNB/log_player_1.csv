Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer wasn't fair considering the inflation we're facing. Let's be realistic: I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This offer ensures you still get a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
