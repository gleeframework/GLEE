"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a good deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be careful. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than 30-70."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the further reduction in value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""This is a fair split considering the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I'm getting a bit low 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I think I can still do better than 45-55. I'm holding out for a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

Considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. It's getting late in the game, and I think this is a fair offer."
