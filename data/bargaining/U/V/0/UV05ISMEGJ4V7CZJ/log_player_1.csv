"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. I think this is the best way to ensure we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
