"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too one-sided, Alice. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  Let's be realistic - you lose more with each round than I do.  Take it while it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
