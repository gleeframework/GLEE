"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Bob in later rounds. It's worth seeing if Alice will propose a better deal in a future round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation disparity.  Let's make this work.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Acknowledging Alice's Concern:** The message directly addresses Alice's initial point about the inflation impact, making Bob appear understanding and open to negotiation. 
* **Slight Improvement for Bob:** The offer increases Bob's share by $50,000 from Alice's initial proposal, reflecting the advantage of future rounds due to inflation.
* **Still Favorable for Alice:** Alice still receives the larger portion, making it likely that she'll accept rather than risk the money's value decreasing in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, let's meet halfway. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offer is getting closer to a more even split. However, Bob still holds a significant advantage in later rounds due to the difference in inflation rates.  It's worth holding out a little longer to see if Alice will propose an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, this is a fair split considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Urgency:** With each round, the total value diminishes, and the risk of getting nothing increases. Bob's message emphasizes this urgency to push Alice toward acceptance.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Bob raises his offer by another $60,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still capitalizing on his advantageous position. 
* **Close to Even:** The offer is now very close to a 50/50 split. This makes it more appealing to Alice while still securing a slight advantage for Bob due to the inflation disparity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting us both, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamic:**  Alice's offer has decreased from her previous one. This indicates that the shrinking pot of money due to inflation is starting to outweigh her initial advantage.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could hold out for a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the risk of Alice becoming more risk-averse and offering even less is significant. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share, even if it's not the absolute ideal. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, the pressure is on. The longer the negotiation continues, the less valuable the total sum becomes for both players."
