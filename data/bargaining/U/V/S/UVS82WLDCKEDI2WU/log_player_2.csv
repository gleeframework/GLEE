"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair deal, considering the inflation rate. Let's finish this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is better than nothing, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation early on. Bob needs to negotiate for a much fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand the inflation affects me more, but your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 60/40 split. It reflects the time pressure while leaving us both with a decent amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 70/30 split is still a fair reflection of the inflation impact on us both. Let's wrap this up before the money depreciates further. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is slowly moving in the right direction, but she's still heavily favoring herself.  Bob needs to hold firm and show Alice he's serious about getting a fair deal. Accepting a 70/30 split at this stage would be a mistake."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere fast.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's a compromise that acknowledges the inflation while still giving us both a reasonable share. Let's end this now before we both lose out more.""
