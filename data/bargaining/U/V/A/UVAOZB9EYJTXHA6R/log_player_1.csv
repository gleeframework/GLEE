"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message to Bob is that I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm taking a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not going easy on you yet. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 20% less, I'll have to consider the value of the money I'll receive.

I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split. I'll try to do better.""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to meet him in the middle and find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not done negotiating yet. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the effects of inflation on Bob's offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, his gain is now worth $551,000 (1,000,000 * 0.9522), and my gain is still worth $600,000.

I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split. I want a better deal.""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a better offer in the next round."

 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, no more negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting $500,000 and Bob getting $500,000. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to meet him halfway and split the money evenly."
