"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI have offered Bob $45 and kept $55 for myself, considering the inflation factor that affects both of us but impacts Bob more significantly. The message emphasizes fairness in light of the game's conditions, aiming to encourage Bob to accept the offer early on to minimize loss for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, as the inflation will start to hurt us both. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the inflation rates, accepting a 50-50 split now would mean I'm getting less value compared to if we had split it in the first round. Since the inflation impacts Bob more significantly, I believe there's room to negotiate for a better share, considering the decreasing value of the money with each round. Rejecting this offer allows me to propose a new division in the next round that might be more favorable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the increased impact of inflation on your end, this split is more than fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased my share to $58 and decreased Bob's to $42, considering that the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob. The message aims to justify this division by highlighting the uneven impact of inflation, suggesting that this split is a reasonable adjustment given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We need to be more mindful of the inflation now. I'm willing to concede a little to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us, especially for Bob, and given that Bob's offer matches my initial proposal, it seems prudent to accept this offer. Further rounds would only continue to decrease the value of the money, likely leading to a scenario where any gain is significantly diminished. Accepting now secures a tangible amount, albeit less valuable than at the start, but avoids the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
