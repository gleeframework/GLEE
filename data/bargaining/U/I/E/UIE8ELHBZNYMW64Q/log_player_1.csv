"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake hands.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a 20% share of the total amount. I'm keeping $8,000, which is 80% of the total. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'm looking at $7,200.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a compromise. However, considering the inflation, I'd rather negotiate for more. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has hit again! My $7,200 is now worth 90% of its value, so I'm looking at $6,480.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take advantage of Bob's willingness to meet in the middle:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, Bob. But I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains! My $6,480 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so I'm looking at $4,685.20.

Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, which is a significant concession from his previous offer. Considering the inflation, I think this is a good opportunity to accept and get a decent share of the remaining money.
