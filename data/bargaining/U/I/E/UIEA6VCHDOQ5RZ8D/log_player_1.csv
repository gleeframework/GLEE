Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair but hopefully tempting offer for Bob.  He gets a little something, but it's clear I'm aiming for the lion's share. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I'd rather have $50 than risk getting nothing at all. It's a good compromise!"
