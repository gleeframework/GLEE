I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation by proposing a reversal of the initial offer. I'm not going to accept that. I'll make my own counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'll offer a 55/45 split in my favor this time. Since the money is worth less, I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I still need to ensure I get a fair share."
