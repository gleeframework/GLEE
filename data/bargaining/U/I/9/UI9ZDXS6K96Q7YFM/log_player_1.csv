I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, considering I am the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split, hoping to secure a deal before inflation takes another bite out of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm unhappy about the 48.8% loss in value, accepting this offer is the best option.  I've already lost a significant amount due to inflation, and further rounds will only reduce my gains.  It's better to secure at least some money than risk getting nothing."
