Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject the offer.  I want to see if I can get a better deal, even though the money will be worth less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, with me taking the larger share.  Let's settle this quickly and avoid the effects of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take a bite, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the next round."
