Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a very unfair offer, Alice. I'm proposing a more reasonable split. This is my counter offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a decent share. Let's meet in the middle.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. It's a good deal for both of us. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to accept the offer.  While the offer is still less than what Alice initially proposed, each round that passes reduces the value of the money considerably. It's likely that the next round will result in a lower payout for Alice due to inflation."
