"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% of the total amount and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will agree to it."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4:6 split, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

I'm offering a 3:2 split, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced proposal."
