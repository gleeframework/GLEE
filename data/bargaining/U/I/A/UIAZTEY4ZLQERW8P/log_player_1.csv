"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 700,000 dollars. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can finish the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, Bob's offer is actually more favorable to me than my initial offer, considering the reduced value of money. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
