I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. I'm hoping to get the majority of the money, but I want to be fair enough to avoid a protracted negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 850,000, but still offering Bob 150,000 to incentivize him to accept. Inflation is starting to bite, so I need to secure a bigger share to compensate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still heavily in his favor, and the inflation penalty is starting to be significant.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to offer a 750,000 to 250,000 split. Inflation is taking a toll, so I need to secure a larger share. However, I'm still offering Bob a reasonable amount to hopefully entice him to accept before the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is still heavily in Bob's favor, the inflation penalty is taking a major toll on my potential gains. I'd rather accept this and secure a decent amount than risk getting nothing in the next round."
