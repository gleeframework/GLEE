Let's see what I can get!  I'll take a chance on a better offer."

I'm going for a bold move here.  I think Alice will realize she needs to compromise if she wants to get anything at all.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to get the lion's share.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to counter Alice's offer from the last round. Since the money is losing value, I need to get a larger share.  I think this offer is fair, given the current circumstances.  Let's see if she takes it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not fair, considering the inflation. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm sticking to the same counter offer, just flipping the roles. I think Alice is seeing the value of the money decrease and will be more willing to compromise now."
