Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference this time. We can both walk away with a reasonable amount.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round that passes reduces the value of Bob's potential gains due to inflation. However, this doesn't benefit me (Alice) as my gains are not impacted by inflation in this scenario. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer. If I reject it, there's a significant risk he will propose an even less favorable split in a future round, knowing the perceived value of his share is decreasing.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees me $475,000. Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in later rounds is risky.  

It's a tough decision, but in a game theory scenario with these rules, sometimes taking a reasonably good offer is better than risking a worse outcome."
