"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $300,000 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $240,000.

I don't think this offer is very generous, considering I'm getting less than half of the original amount. I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 360000, ""bob_gain"": 640000}

This is a 36-64 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise given the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the money in this round.

My gain of $450,000 is worth 45% of its original value, which is $450,000 * 0.45 = $202,500.

Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 55% of its original value, which is $550,000 * 0.55 = $302,500.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable than the previous one. I'll accept it.
