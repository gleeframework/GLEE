"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise on the ratio, but I think 7:3 is a more reasonable split given the risks of inflation. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
