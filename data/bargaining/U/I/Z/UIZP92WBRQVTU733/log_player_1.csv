Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'll accept your initial offer from Round 1. It's clear we both want to maximize our gains, and this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750

This is the best time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  While Bob is offering what you initially proposed, remember the value is decreasing for you each round. Accepting now gets you more than holding out for a potentially better offer later.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob rejecting your previous offers and then agreeing to your initial offer suggests he's unlikely to go higher.  

Accepting this offer ensures you get a reasonable share before inflation further eats into your potential gains."
