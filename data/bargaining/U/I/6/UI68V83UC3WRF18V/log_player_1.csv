I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something now, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation is working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to stick with my original offer. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of Bob's gain, while it's only slightly impacted mine. I believe this is still a fair offer and he'll be more inclined to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  The inflation has significantly reduced Bob's gain, while it's hurting me more. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob. The inflation is now impacting my potential gains significantly, so I need to be more flexible. However, I believe this is still a good offer, considering the rapidly diminishing value of Bob's share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer isn't ideal, the inflation is hitting me hard.  I've lost a significant amount of potential earnings, and Bob's offer is the best I can get at this point.  I'll accept it and move on."
