I'm going to try to be fair, but I also want to get as much as possible. I'm offering Bob 100,000, which is a pretty good deal for him, considering he's getting nothing if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though my share is significantly less than the first round, it's still better than getting nothing.  I'd rather take 300,000 than risk getting nothing in the next round."
