"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself slightly as I'm the one making the initial offer.  This leaves some room for negotiation in the next round if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair.  If I reject, I risk getting less in the next round as the money will be worth less to Bob due to inflation."
