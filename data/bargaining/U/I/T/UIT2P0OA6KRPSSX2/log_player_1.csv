"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'd be getting 4800. Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round, so he'd be getting 6000.

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather not give up more than I have to. My current offer in round 1 was 6000, and I'm not willing to go below that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, my gain is worth 40% less than in the first round, so I'd be getting 3600. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400
}
