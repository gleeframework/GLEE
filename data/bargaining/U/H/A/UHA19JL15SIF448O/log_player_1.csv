# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is positioning this as his ""final offer,"" there's still a lot of time left on the clock.  He's hurting more from inflation than I am. Holding out for a better offer is still the stronger move, even if it means going down to the wire."
