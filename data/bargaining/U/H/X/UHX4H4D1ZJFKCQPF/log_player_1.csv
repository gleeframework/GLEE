{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, my gain of $60 in the first round is now worth $54 in the second round. I'll reject this offer since I can do better than that. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% reduction in value due to inflation (10% in round 1 and 10% in round 2):

  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
