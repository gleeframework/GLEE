"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a nice chunk to begin with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While a good starting point, I think I can do better in the later rounds!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I believe a more balanced split is better for both of us in the long run, considering the inflation rate.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's find a split that works for both of us before the inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, it's important to secure a deal before the inflation becomes too severe. This offer provides a decent amount, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
