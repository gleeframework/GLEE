"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than before, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this case, I think I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
