I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving me a larger share. I believe it's a fair starting point given the limited rounds. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather secure half the money than risk getting nothing at all."
