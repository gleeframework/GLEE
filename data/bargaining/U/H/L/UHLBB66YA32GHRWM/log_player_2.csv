"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. I think it's a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer.  Even with inflation, there's a chance I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split. It's a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. I believe this is a more equitable deal than your previous offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can find a better split than 60/40. I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 feels more fair given the inflation and my previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer will at least give me a decent sum, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
