Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We both want a good share, and we only have 10 rounds left. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Importantly, time is working against me more than it's working against her.  I need to apply more pressure, but I also need to show I'm willing to negotiate. A rejection here sets up for a potentially more favorable counter-offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a middle ground.  My offer is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more to inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm moving closer to a 50/50 split to signal I'm willing to negotiate, but not giving in completely.
* **Time pressure:**  I'm emphasizing the time pressure and the shrinking pot to try to get Alice to settle.  
* **""Fair compromise"":**  Framing my offer as a reasonable compromise helps to make it more appealing."
