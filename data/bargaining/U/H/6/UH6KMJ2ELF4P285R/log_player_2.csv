Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a good deal for both of us considering the time pressure and the shrinking pot. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While the offer might seem tempting as time runs out,  it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but this needs to be a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm bumping my offer up slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a share that reflects the fact that the value diminishes significantly for me with each round. The message emphasizes fairness and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement, hoping to nudge Alice towards a more reasonable stance."
