"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This means I'm offering to take $8,000 and give Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as keen on this offer. I'd rather try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the accelerated inflation, the money is losing value rapidly. I'll have to be more cautious and consider the reduced value of the money. However, Bob's offer is still relatively close to the original amount, so I'll accept this one.
