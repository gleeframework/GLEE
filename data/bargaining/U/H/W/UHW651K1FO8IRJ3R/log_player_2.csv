"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money as time passes, but your loss is less significant.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm aiming for a fairer deal. This offer considers the shrinking value of the money, especially for me.  Time is running out, let's agree and get something! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right to highlight the time pressure, but she's still getting a better net gain even with the faster devaluation. I need to hold out for a better deal, but I need to be mindful that the money is rapidly losing value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  It's the most balanced we'll achieve given the circumstances. Let's be reasonable and end this here.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  The rapidly decreasing value of the money means I need to push for a deal quickly. 
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm adding pressure on Alice to accept a deal that's still in her favor (slightly) when accounting for devaluation.
* **Appearance of Compromise:** While I'm holding firm, the message is framed as a compromise to make it more palatable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise.  It's clear we both want to leave with something. This offer acknowledges the time pressure and gives us both a decent share. Don't let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is dropping drastically. With each round, the potential gains shrink significantly.
* **Alice's Offer is Fair (Considering Devaluation):** While Alice's offer is numerically similar to my previous one, the rapid devaluation means this offer actually nets me *more* in real terms than if I had held out for a slightly better split in a later round.
* **Risk of Losing Everything:** If I reject this and Alice rejects my next offer, we're getting very close to a scenario where even a 50/50 split is worth very little. It's better to take a decent deal now than risk ending up with nothing."
