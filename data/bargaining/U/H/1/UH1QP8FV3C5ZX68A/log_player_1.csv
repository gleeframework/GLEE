"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation.  It gives Bob a small amount to start, and leaves me with the majority of the funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, accepting this offer is the best option.  The inflation means that each round my share is worth less, and a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome."
