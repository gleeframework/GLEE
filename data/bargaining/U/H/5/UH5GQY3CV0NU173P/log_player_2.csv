"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to start, and we can adjust in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a 50/50 split seems fair, the offer benefits Alice more since the money is losing value faster for Bob. It's better to see what kind of offer Alice will make in the next round, as Bob has the advantage of making the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering the inflation difference. We can adjust in the next round if you think it's not right.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I think this is a fair compromise given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice is offering a better deal than the 50/50 split she proposed in the first round. Although inflation is hurting Bob more, accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a decent amount and avoids the risk of Alice potentially offering a worse deal in the next round."
