Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

It's getting risky to keep rejecting, even if I'm not happy with the deal. Inflation is hurting my potential gains. I'll accept and get something rather than risk getting nothing."
