Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority but still give you a decent share.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving you all the power. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 20% less value for Bob's share, and I think I can do better. I'll try to negotiate or make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slightly larger share. This way, we both get a decent amount.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving you all the power. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my share due to inflation, and I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous ones. I'll try to negotiate or make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, let's split it 50/50 and end this game.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
