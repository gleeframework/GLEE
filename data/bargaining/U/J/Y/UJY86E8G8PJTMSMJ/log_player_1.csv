"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share since I'm the one making the next offer. This way, I'll get a decent chunk of the initial sum and still leave something for you. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
