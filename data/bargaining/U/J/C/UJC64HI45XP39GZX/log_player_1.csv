Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, considering I'll be making the next offer if you reject this. It's a fairer split than the previous one, and ensures we both benefit from the potential inflation loss. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
