"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Let's see what you have to say!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm curious to hear Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much just yet. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 95% of the original $5000, so it's equivalent to $4,750.

I'll think about it for a moment... Since Bob is still getting a larger share, I'll have to consider whether it's worth rejecting this offer and waiting for a better deal. But, I'll take a chance and...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90.25% of the original amount (95% of 95% = 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025). So, my gain of $4000 is now equivalent to $3609.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm not giving up too much. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much more. I'm starting to get a little worried about the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4200 in Round 3 is now worth 85.73% of the original $5000, so it's equivalent to $4281.50. Then, with the inflation effect in Round 4, my gain of $4281.50 is worth 85.73% of the previous amount, so it's equivalent to $3665.41.

I'll think about it for a moment... Bob's offer is a bit more generous than the previous one, but I'm still not sure if it's the best deal. However, I'm getting a bit worried about the inflation too...
