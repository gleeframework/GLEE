Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I still think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. Let's try 55/45.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a fair split, but I'm facing a tighter deadline.  65/35 is my final offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not happy with the decreasing offers, Bob.  Let's try a 45/55 split to meet somewhere in the middle.  We're running out of time! 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough decision point, as the value for Bob is diminishing rapidly.  While ideally, a higher split for Bob would be preferable, accepting 55/45 at this stage is better than risking getting nothing if the negotiation goes to the final round."
