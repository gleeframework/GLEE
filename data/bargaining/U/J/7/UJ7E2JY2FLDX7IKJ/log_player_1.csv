"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my calculation to account for the inflation. Since my gain is worth 10% less, I'll get $56 (40 / 0.9).

I'll accept this offer:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
