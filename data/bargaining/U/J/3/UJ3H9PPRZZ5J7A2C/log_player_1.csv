Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep almost all the money for myself, giving Bob only $1.  This is a very aggressive opening move, but it's meant to show Bob I'm serious about getting a good deal.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's risky to reject and risk getting nothing at all.  Let's take the 500,000!"
