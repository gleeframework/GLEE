Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 9500/500 split is fairer, considering I'm taking on the risk of rejection. Let's be reasonable here. 
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
