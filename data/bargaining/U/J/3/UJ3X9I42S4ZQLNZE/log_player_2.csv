"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 9500/500 is too lopsided. I propose 8550 for me and 1450 for you. This still leaves you with a significant portion of the money, while acknowledging the impact of inflation on my share. 
# Bob gain: 1450 
# Alice gain: 8550
