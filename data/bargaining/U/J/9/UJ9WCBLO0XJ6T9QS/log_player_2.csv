"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60% and you take 40%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can be more efficient here. How about you take 40% and I take 60%?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid further rounds. How about you take 45% and I'll take 55%? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, getting 45% is better than what I was initially offered and better than the risk of another round."
