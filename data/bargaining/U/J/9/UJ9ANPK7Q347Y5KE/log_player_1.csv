"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the inflation factor.

Since my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my gain in the second round as 95% of the original amount.

40 * 0.95 = 38

Since Bob's offer is 40, which is more than my calculated gain, I'll accept the offer.
