"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is taking its toll! The money is worth less and less. Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm now offering a 50-50 split, hoping to find a compromise with Bob."
