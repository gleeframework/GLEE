Round 3

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. I'll take a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation.  While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, getting less than 40% after inflation is even worse. I need to show I'm serious about not getting low-balled."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.  I'd rather lose money to inflation than let you walk away with 60%.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the pressure is on. Alice needs to understand I'm serious.
* **Limit Losses:** While 45% isn't great after inflation, it's better than the downward trend Alice is trying to establish.
* **Finality:** The ""take it or leave it"" shows I'm done negotiating. This might push Alice to accept, especially since further delays hurt my offer more than hers."
