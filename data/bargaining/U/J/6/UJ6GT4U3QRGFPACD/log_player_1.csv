Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting to be fair, but now it's my turn to propose. Let's avoid further inflation and settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle to avoid more inflation!""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's meet in the middle, but I need a bit more to compensate for the previous rounds. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. The difference between our proposed divisions is getting smaller, and considering the increasing inflation, it's better to settle now rather than risking further devaluation of the money. This way, we both get a reasonable share without losing too much value."
