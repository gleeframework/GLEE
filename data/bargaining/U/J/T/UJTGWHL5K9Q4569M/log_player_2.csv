Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. After two rounds, I'm willing to meet you in the middle with an even split.  We can't keep going back and forth, or the value of the money will be gone! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
