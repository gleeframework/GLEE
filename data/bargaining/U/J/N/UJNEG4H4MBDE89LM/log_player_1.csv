"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I think I can do better than a 60-40 split, especially considering the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This is a 58-42 split, which seems more favorable to me given the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth significantly less now, I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I think this offer is fair enough, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll take the 40% share of the remaining $816,000 (after inflation)."
