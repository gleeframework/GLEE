"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I'll take less, you take less.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $900,000 and leave $100,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take more, but you'll get a decent share too. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In Round 1, Bob's offer was worth $100,000, which is now worth $80,000 (20% less). I'm still getting $900,000, which is the same as before.

Considering Bob's offer in Round 2, I'll get $800,000, which is more than I got in Round 1, but less than I got in Round 1 in terms of real value. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $750,000 and leave $250,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm still willing to give you a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In Round 1, Bob's offer was worth $100,000, which is now worth $51,200 (48.8% less). I'm still getting $900,000, which is the same as before.

Considering Bob's offer in Round 4, I'll get $700,000, which is less than I got in Round 1 in terms of real value. However, it's still a decent offer, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better one later.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4.
