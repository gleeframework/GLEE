"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority this time""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more this time, but it's still a fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about the 49-51 split. However, I don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially getting a worse deal.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
