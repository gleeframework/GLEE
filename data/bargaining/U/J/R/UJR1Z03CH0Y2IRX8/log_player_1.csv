Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite unfair. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This accounts for the fact that I'm losing money at a faster rate with each round. Think carefully before rejecting, as the pot will be smaller for both of us if we continue. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value quickly. My previous offer was already generous, considering I lose money at twice your rate. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is my final offer. If you reject this, I'm afraid we'll both walk away with significantly less.
