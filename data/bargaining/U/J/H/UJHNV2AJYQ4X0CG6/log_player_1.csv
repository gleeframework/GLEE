Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive offer in the first round. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share right away, or if he's going to try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like to get more, accepting a 50/50 split in the second round is a good deal. The inflation would make future negotiations riskier and it's unclear how the inflation affects Bob."
