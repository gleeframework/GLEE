"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you with 10%.  We can adjust in later rounds if you're not happy with this. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better deal. With inflation, the money is worth less to me with each passing round, but I'd like to take the chance to get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 40% for me, 60% for you.""}\n\n###\nI'm hoping that by offering a more even split, Alice will be willing to accept this proposal and we can end the game before the inflation takes too big of a toll."
