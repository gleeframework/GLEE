"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 45-55 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to be strategic with my offer. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
