I'm going to reject this offer. While 25$ is something, I'm hoping to get a better deal, especially since the money will be worth less in the next round."

The inflation is working in my favor, so I'll try to get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to stick with a slightly higher share for myself, but still offer Alice a fair amount considering the inflation."

Alice's offer is becoming more reasonable with each round due to the impact of inflation, and getting a 50/50 split is a good outcome."
