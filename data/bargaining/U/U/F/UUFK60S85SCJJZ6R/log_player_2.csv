Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective on the devaluation, but a 60/40 split is still too lopsided.  Let's meet in the middle at 55/45.  This keeps things fair, while still acknowledging the risk of waiting. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
