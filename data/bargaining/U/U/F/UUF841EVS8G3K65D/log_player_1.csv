Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should be fair, I'll take $60 and you get $40.

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to $55 for you, Alice. It's a fair deal, and we can avoid losing more money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it down the middle, $50 each, and call it a day.  We are both losing out because of the inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every round. Let's be reasonable. I'll take $60 and you can have $40.  It's the best we can do at this point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

It's painful, but at this point, Bob is unlikely to offer anything better. Accepting a 40/60 split now is better than risking getting nothing in a few more rounds."
