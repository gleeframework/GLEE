"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  Let's see if he's happy with that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm going to try to be more reasonable, but still keep the majority of the money. I'm proposing $8,500 for myself and $1,500 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite.  It's better to take $2000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
