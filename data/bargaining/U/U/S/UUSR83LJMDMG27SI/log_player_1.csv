"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to propose a 80/20 split in my favor.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, and the money is losing value faster for him than for me, I think he'll be more inclined to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less for Bob, he's still getting the majority. I'm willing to risk another round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Bob has rejected my previous offers, but with the inflation, his share is becoming increasingly less valuable. I think he'll be more motivated to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still getting the majority of the money. Even though the value is decreasing for him, I'm not ready to accept such an uneven split. I'm willing to gamble and hope for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split. Inflation is hitting Bob hard, and he's rejected every offer where he gets less than 70%.  I think he'll be more willing to accept something closer to an even split at this point."
