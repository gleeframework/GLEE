"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This offer gives me a good chunk of the money, but leaves enough for Bob to potentially accept. It's a good starting point, and we can adjust in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is still quite generous, I believe I can still get a better deal. With the inflation factor in play, it's in my best interest to keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Given the inflation, both of us lose a significant amount of money with each passing round. This offer is fair and allows us to both maximize our gains despite the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject offers. The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and I'm worried that rejecting this offer might result in a worse deal in the next round. It's time to cut my losses and secure at least a decent amount of money."
