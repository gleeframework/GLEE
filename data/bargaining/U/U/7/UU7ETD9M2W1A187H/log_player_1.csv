"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting 80% of the $10,000 and Bob getting 20%. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $8000 is now worth $7600 (95% of $8000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. I'm not thrilled about taking $6000, but it's still a decent offer. I'm not sure if I want to push for more, considering the inflation factor.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so my target is to maximize my gain in real terms.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting any younger, and I need a decent share.""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a slightly better deal, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much more. You're getting closer, but still not close enough. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at my potential gains!

In this round, my $8000 is now worth $6860 (85.75% of $8000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking $5500, but it's still a decent offer. However, I think I can do better.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so I need to be strategic.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to what I want, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's make a deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal, while also leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. Let's try to find a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

In this round, my $8000 is now worth $6196 (77.45% of $8000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm surprised he's willing to meet me halfway. A 50-50 split is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair deal.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
