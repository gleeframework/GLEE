"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% of the money. Is this fair?""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully. With the current offer, I'll gain $2,000, which is worth 95% of $2,200 (5% less than $2,333.33, the original $2,000 value).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems Bob is getting a larger share of the money. I'll have to think about it...

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% of the money. Will you accept?""
}
```

This offer gives me $5,500 and Bob $4,500. I'm hoping Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle!

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $4,000 is worth 87.5% of $4,600 (14.26% less than $5,333.33, the original $4,000 value).
Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 82.5% of $7,273.33 (27.1% less than $10,000).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. But I don't want to reject it and risk getting an even worse offer in the next round.
