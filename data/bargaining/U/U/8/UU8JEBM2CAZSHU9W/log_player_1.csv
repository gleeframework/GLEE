I'm going to be greedy and propose a 900k/100k split in my favor.  I figure Bob might take it since it's better than nothing, but I'm ready to negotiate further if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very bold with this offer! It's definitely much better than nothing, but I'm not going to accept it just yet. There are still plenty of rounds left, and I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 700k/300k. While Bob is being aggressive, I'm still confident I can get a more favorable deal.  I'm trying to be fair while still getting a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal considering the inflation. While I'd love to get more, taking half is definitely better than getting nothing. I'm accepting the offer and ending the game."
