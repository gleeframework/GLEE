"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 40-60 split is more fair, considering we both want to maximize our gains. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end this game sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
