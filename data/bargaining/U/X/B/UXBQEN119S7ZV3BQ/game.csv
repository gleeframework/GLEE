6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple and fair split. I propose I take $6,000, leaving you with $4,000.  This ensures we both benefit from this deal immediately.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think a 55/45 split is more fair. It's a bit more in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd prefer a more equal division.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the offer, Bob, a 55/45 split feels a bit too skewed in your favor.  Let's aim for something more balanced in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, how about we switch it up? I'll take $5,500 and you take $4,500. It's fair and mirrors your previous offer, just with the roles reversed.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Let's try a 60/40 split this time. I'm willing to give you a bit more than your initial offer, but I need to get a better deal for myself to make this worthwhile.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, we're running out of time, and this offer is moving in the wrong direction. We need to find a compromise quickly if we want to both benefit.",Alice,4,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you more than I initially wanted - $5,250. Take it before inflation eats away at this any further!",Alice,5,
