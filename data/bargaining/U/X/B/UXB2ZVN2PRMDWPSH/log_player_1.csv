"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This allows for a more substantial amount for investment or personal use.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fairer distribution, considering we both have an equal say in the decision. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
