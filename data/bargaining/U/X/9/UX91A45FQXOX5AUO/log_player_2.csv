Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the impact of inflation is severe. While ideally, I'd want a larger share, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We are in round 9 with only 3 rounds left. The longer this drags on, the less valuable the money becomes for me.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Rejecting this offer in hopes of a slightly better deal in later rounds is very risky. The difference in potential gains is shrinking rapidly due to inflation.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently offered slightly better deals but is unwilling to deviate significantly from her desired split. It's unlikely she will concede much more.

It's a tough pill to swallow, but taking the sure bet now is better than risking a complete loss in the final rounds."
