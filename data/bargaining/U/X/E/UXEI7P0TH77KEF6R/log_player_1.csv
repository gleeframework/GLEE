"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair starting offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try to meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure I want to give up so much. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round with a 20% decrease in value again.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can move on to the next round."
