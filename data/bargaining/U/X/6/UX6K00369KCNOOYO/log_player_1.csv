"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to split the money evenly. That's a reasonable proposal, but I was hoping to get a bit more.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me, but still fair""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
