  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point.""
}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which I believe is a generous starting point. Let's see if he accepts or decides to proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 65-35 is a fairer split, considering the inflation factor. Let's start with a more balanced approach. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
