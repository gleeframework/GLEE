This is a terrible deal for Bob! While it seems like Bob gets something, in the long run, this offer will likely result in Bob getting nothing. The money decreases in value with each round, so it's crucial to maximize his share early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though this offer is significantly better than the first one, it's still not a good deal for Bob. We need to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further.  The inflation is working against Bob, so we need to secure a larger share before it gets too late."

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than the last one, it's still not a good deal for Bob. It's important to remember that each round the inflation is eating away at Bob's potential gains.  We need to see if Alice is willing to budge further or if we need to try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Alice is still trying to get the majority of the money, but Bob's potential gains are shrinking rapidly due to inflation.  We need to try and secure a larger share before it's too late."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000} 
``` 
At this point, Bob needs to try and secure a more even split. The inflation is really hurting his potential gains.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Alice will accept it."
