"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I'm not willing to accept a 2-8 split, especially with the money losing value due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like to propose a 55-45 split. It's a bit more generous, don't you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money keeps decreasing!

After considering Bob's new offer, I decide to reject it. The 3-7 split is still not favorable to me, and I'm not willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there yet! I'll try to squeeze out a bit more. How about a 52-48 split?""
