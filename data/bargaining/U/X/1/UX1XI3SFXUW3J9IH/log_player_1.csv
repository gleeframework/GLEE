"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $45 and kept $55 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split. I'm slightly favoring myself since I made the offer, but it's still a reasonable division. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject the offer since I previously offered Bob $45 and now he's offering me $50, but due to inflation, this $50 is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll take into account the inflation and aim for a slightly higher amount than before to compensate for the loss in value. I'll also try to be more persuasive with my message.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split now. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value!""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's avoid further losses. I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share this time, but let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","At this point, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation (14.26% less than the original amount), accepting $48 might actually be a better deal than trying to negotiate further. Each round, the money loses 5% of its value, and the difference between what Bob is offering and what I might gain by negotiating further is becoming less significant. It seems wise to accept this offer and end the game before the money loses even more value.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
