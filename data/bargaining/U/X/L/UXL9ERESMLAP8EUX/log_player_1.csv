"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly than Bob, it seems.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain due to inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. But on the other hand, Bob's offer is quite generous, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting a worse deal.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
