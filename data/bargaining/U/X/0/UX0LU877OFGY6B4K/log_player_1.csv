"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2,000 and keep $8,000 for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,500 in real terms.

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the fairest way, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about splitting it evenly. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation again, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,500 in real terms.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. It's a good compromise, don't you think?""
}
```"
