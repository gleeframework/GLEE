"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth the most in the first round and decreases by 10% each subsequent round, accepting the offer to split it evenly in the first round guarantees the highest possible value for both players. Rejecting this offer would lead to a decrease in the overall value of the money in the next round, potentially resulting in a less favorable outcome for both players. Therefore, accepting the even split in the first round is the most rational decision to maximize gain."
