I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This seems fair as I am the one making the proposal and the inflation rate will hurt Bob more than me in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering 8000 for myself and 2000 for Bob. While this is a lower split for me than in round 1, it is a better deal than the 1000/9000 split offered by Bob.  The inflation rate is still working in my favor, and Bob is likely to accept this offer as it is more favorable to him than the previous round."
