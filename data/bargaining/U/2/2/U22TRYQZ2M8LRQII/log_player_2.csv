Alice's offer:

Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic, I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. The longer this takes, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we don't lose more to inflation. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
