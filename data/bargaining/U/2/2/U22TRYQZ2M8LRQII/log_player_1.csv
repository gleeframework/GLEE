Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic, I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. The longer this takes, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
