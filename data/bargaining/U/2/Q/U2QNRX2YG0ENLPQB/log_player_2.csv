"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take something, it's better to see if we can get a better deal.  Let's see if Alice will be willing to give up more in later rounds."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""I think we can find a compromise where we both get a good share.  Let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor.  We can always adjust later.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 70/30 split feels more fair to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still offering a deal that feels very uneven. I'm going to try to hold out for a more balanced split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
