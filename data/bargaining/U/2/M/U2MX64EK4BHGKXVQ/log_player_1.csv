"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a bigger share for himself.

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 3:7 split. The money is still worth the same for me, but Bob's share is worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but still a more favorable split than his previous offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I still think I deserve a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still trying to get a better deal for himself.

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a slightly better deal than his previous offer, I still think I can do better. The money is worth less for Bob now, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to give me a better share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""50/50, let's shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money. Let's see if he'll accept this straightforward offer!"
