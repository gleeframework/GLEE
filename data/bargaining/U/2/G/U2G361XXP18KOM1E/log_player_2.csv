Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  Take it or leave it, but I won't accept less. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning: While not ideal, Alice is clearly getting more and more impatient. If I reject this offer, there's a good chance she'll offer me even less next round, with the potential of getting nothing if the game drags on. It's better to take a reasonable, though not perfect, amount now.
