"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70 and you can take 30.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial 100$, which is 30 dollars. I'll take the remaining 70 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is being generous enough yet. I'd like to see a better offer before I accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up my end of the deal. Let's split it 50/50.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise."
