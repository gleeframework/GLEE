"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not being too generous! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be strategic.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation rate, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're being stingy, Bob! I'm trying to be reasonable!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but don't think you're getting away with too much! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be careful. However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my previous one, and it's still a relatively even split.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
