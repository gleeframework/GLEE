"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively equal split, considering I'm the one making the first offer."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of rejecting your first offer! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the offer is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too greedy, I'd like a better deal""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

}
```

I'm making a new offer that's closer to a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this compromise."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
