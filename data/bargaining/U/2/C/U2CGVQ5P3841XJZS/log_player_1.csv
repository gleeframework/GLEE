"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This is my first offer, I'm aiming for a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm taking a gamble that Bob will accept a decent offer in the first round to avoid the risk of getting a worse deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than my original offer, and the inflation will only make it worse if I wait. I will reject and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to 5500/4500, hoping to find a middle ground while still maintaining a slight advantage. I'm taking the inflation into account, but I believe this offer still reflects my position as the proposer."
