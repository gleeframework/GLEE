**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making small concessions, time is working against her more than me.  It's still in my best interest to hold out for a better offer. The longer Alice waits, the less appealing her initially favorable split becomes due to the inflation working against her."

Round 6

{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Time is money Alice, literally! This is a very fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're past the halfway point, and I need to start applying more pressure.  By offering a nearly even split, I'm highlighting that the inflation makes her previous offers less appealing. She needs to accept that the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for her."
