"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving 90% of the money. I'm hoping this will be a fair enough offer for Bob to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 88 
# Bob gain: 12 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a larger share, it's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will continue to offer me less and less in subsequent rounds due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent amount of money, even if it's less than my initial proposal."
