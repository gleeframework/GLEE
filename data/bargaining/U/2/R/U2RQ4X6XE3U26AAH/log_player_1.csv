Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good starting point considering the inflation will favor me in the next round if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a bigger share, the inflation would make my next offer even less appealing to Bob, and it's likely he'd reject it.  Accepting a 50/50 split ensures I get something, even if it's less than I initially wanted."
