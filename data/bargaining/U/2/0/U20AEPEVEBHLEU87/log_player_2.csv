"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work something out later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to get a small amount now, it's better to wait and see what Alice offers in the next round.  There's a chance she'll be more willing to split the money more evenly when she's the one making the proposal.  Also, the inflation will start to work in my favor if I hold out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way we both get a good amount and don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our gains.""}
