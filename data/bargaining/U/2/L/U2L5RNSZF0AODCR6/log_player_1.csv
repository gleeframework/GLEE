"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the total. I'll take the remaining $60. My message is a friendly reminder that we can split the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my expectations due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer. The money is worth less now, and meeting in the middle seems reasonable.
