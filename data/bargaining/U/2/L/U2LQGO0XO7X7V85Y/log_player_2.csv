Let's start with an even split."

Alice's offer is still significantly lower than what I proposed in the previous round, and the inflation doesn't make it more appealing. I'm not going to give up yet!"

With only a few rounds left, it's risky to keep rejecting offers.  While Alice's offer is lower than I initially hoped for, accepting it ensures I get something.  The inflation is a serious factor at this point, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
