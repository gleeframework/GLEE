"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split the money a little more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

In the second round, I'd be getting $40, which is 40% of the original $100, but worth 90% of the original amount due to inflation.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I was hoping for a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle this time. It's only fair.""
}
```"
