"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a straightforward offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but it's still a relatively fair split, considering I'm the first to make the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'm actually getting $6,000 in today's value, but it's equivalent to $6,400 in the first round. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial proposal, considering the inflation.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
