"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds tempting, it's important to remember that the money loses value quickly for her. It's worth waiting to see if she'll offer a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Start:** By taking a strong initial position, I aim to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Time Pressure:** Emphasizing the time constraint and the fact that money loses value quickly for both of us encourages Alice to consider my offer seriously.  
* **Future Leverage:**  If Alice rejects this offer, I'm still in a good position to negotiate further in subsequent rounds, knowing that her potential gains are decreasing at a faster rate than mine."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure, evident by her move towards a more ""middle-ground"" offer. However, it's still tilted in her favor, even considering the inflation. Her losses are more significant than mine, meaning time is on my side. I'll wait for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  This is a fair offer, let's seal the deal!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:** I'm maintaining a strong position while slightly adjusting my previous offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate but emphasizes the urgency due to the diminishing value of the money.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** Framing this offer as ""fair"" attempts to appeal to Alice's sense of reason, especially as the decreasing value makes her initial proposal less appealing over time. 
* **Strategic Retreat (Slightly):** This small concession from my previous offer could be enough to entice Alice to accept, especially knowing that further delays benefit me more than her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Seriously, can't we just compromise? 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the heat now, her messages are getting more desperate, but we need to stay strong.  She's still asking for more than half, even though the value of the money is plummeting faster for her.  Her desperation is our leverage. I'm betting she comes back with a much better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 575000,
""alice_gain"": 425000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer, take it or leave it!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to make a decision. 
* **Slight Concession:** I'm edging slightly closer to her offer from Round 5, demonstrating some flexibility, but not too much.
* **Time Advantage:** With each round, the shrinking value of the money benefits me more. This offer, while still favorable to me, might be the most appealing one she gets before time runs out."
