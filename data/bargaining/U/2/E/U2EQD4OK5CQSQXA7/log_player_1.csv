Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a very small amount to get something at all, or if he's going to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome.  It's better than getting nothing in 12 rounds!"
