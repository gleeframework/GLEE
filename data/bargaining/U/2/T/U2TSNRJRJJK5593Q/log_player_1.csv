"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward division of the $10,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you a good deal this round! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75/25 split, even if it's a ""good deal"". I'd like to negotiate further to get a fairer share. Let's see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again!

Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a 42/58 split is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but don't expect it to get any bigger 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the decreasing value of the money and Bob's message, I decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, even if it's a ""generous"" offer from Bob. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better share, but I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The stakes are getting higher!

Considering the rapid inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a slight improvement from the previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will take this as a serious offer and accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
