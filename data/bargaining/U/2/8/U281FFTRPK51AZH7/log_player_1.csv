"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, giving Bob 40% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the offer and end the game."
