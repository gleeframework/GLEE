"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 50/50, but I'll give you a chance to change your mind 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new values, I'm not too thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I think it's a good opportunity to get a decent amount of money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 5000$ and call it a day!"
