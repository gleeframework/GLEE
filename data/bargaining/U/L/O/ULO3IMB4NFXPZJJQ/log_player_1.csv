"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

This is a risky move, but I'm going for a large chunk of the money to start.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, as he only gets a small amount. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though I'm losing a lot of money in this round due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best option.  The money I'll receive is worth 5% less than what Bob offered in round 1, but that's better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
