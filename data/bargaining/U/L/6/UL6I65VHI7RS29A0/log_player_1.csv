I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  I figure Bob might be tempted to accept it, as even a dollar is better than nothing if he thinks the chances of getting a better deal in the next round are slim.  Plus, the inflation on my side is negligible, so this is basically free money for me!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a much better deal for Bob than my initial offer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the future, especially since the inflation is working in my favor!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer significantly, but still keeping a large share for myself. Bob's inflation is working against him, and he might be tempted to accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing if the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a step in the right direction for Bob, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. He's experiencing significant inflation, and he knows that the longer we play, the less his money is worth. I'm confident that I can get a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping a significant share for myself. Bob's inflation is mounting, and I'm sure he's feeling the pressure. He might be willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting nothing if we continue to play."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than my last offer, and with his inflation rate, it's likely he won't make a better offer in the next round. I'm getting a decent share, and the game is ending before my own inflation kicks in. This is a good deal for me."
