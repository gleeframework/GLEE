"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, take it or leave it. This is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The longer the game goes, the less Bob's potential share is worth due to inflation.  It's in his best interest to secure a deal quickly.
* **Strong Position:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob has signaled he's willing to walk away from an unfair deal. This puts him in a stronger position for Round 2.
* **Finality:**  The message ""This is my final offer"" adds pressure on Alice.  She knows if she rejects it, Bob will likely offer even less in subsequent rounds (due to inflation). 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is rational and also wants to maximize her gains. If Alice is completely indifferent to the outcome or acts irrationally, this strategy might backfire."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer to what I want 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unfavorable:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering Bob's money is losing value.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Bob needs to gauge how much further Alice is willing to go. Another rejection sends a strong message that he's serious about a fairer split.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Yes, there's a risk Alice might dig in her heels. But, there's also a chance she'll come back in Round 4 with a much better offer, especially as the game drags on and the potential for a no-deal outcome increases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.  I'm willing to compromise, but this is as low as I'll go.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by going slightly below a 50/50 split, acknowledging the time pressure from inflation.
* **Firmness:** The message emphasizes that this is Bob's bottom line. He's communicating that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome for Alice.
* **Urgency:** By stating ""this is as low as I'll go,"" Bob reinforces the time-sensitive nature of the situation. Delay only hurts him, adding pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With each round, Bob's position worsens significantly due to inflation.  He's now losing over 34% of his potential earnings.
* **Marginal Gains:**  While Alice's offer is still not ideal, it's only slightly worse than Bob's last offer.  The potential gain from continuing to negotiate is outweighed by the guaranteed losses from inflation. 
* **Psychological Pressure:**  Alice's message is clearly designed to exploit Bob's weakening position. While it shouldn't be the deciding factor, it highlights the risk of pushing further and potentially ending up with a worse deal or nothing at all. 
 
**In short, Bob is better off taking a less-than-ideal deal now rather than risking a much worse outcome by continuing to play.**"
