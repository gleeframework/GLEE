"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice gets 900,000 dollars and Bob gets 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation to benefit Bob more than Alice in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering 800,000 to me and 200,000 to Bob.  This is a compromise from my first offer and still leaves a significant portion for Bob, while ensuring I still receive a good share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering 700,000 to me and 300,000 to Bob.  Even with the inflation, this still leaves a significant portion for Bob, and I'm willing to give up a bit more to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 320000 
# Bob gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and the inflation is hurting him much more than me at this point. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering 600,000 to myself and 400,000 to Bob.  While I am still the one making the proposal, I'm  recognizing the significant impact inflation has had on Bob's potential share. This offer gives him a decent amount while still ensuring I receive a sizable portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still significantly less than what I initially proposed, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of money for him.  At this point, accepting his offer is the best option for me.  He's barely getting anything from this deal, and I'm securing a decent portion."
