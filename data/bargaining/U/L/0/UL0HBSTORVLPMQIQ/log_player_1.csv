"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the effect of inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, my gain of $40 is actually equivalent to $38 in the first round. And since Bob's gain is worth 10% less, his gain of $60 is actually equivalent to $54 in the first round.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a good one, and I'll accept it.
