"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can wrap up the game early! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's tempting to take the easy money, but I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 20/80 split.  Let's try a more even split.  What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Consider this offer! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hit, and this offer is closer to what I'm aiming for. It's time to lock in some gains."
