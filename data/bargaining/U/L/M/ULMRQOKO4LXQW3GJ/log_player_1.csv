"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with. Fair and simple.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start with, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slight advantage because of the inflation. Let's see if you accept this deal, or we can continue negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob took a slight advantage in the previous round, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep some buffer against inflation. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle.""}

I'm offering Bob a 55/45 split, trying to find a more balanced compromise."
