"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, with each of us getting $5000. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the offer. Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I made the first offer and is now trying to get a larger share. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think 4000 is too low for me. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 50/50 is a fair starting point. Let's meet in the middle and see how it goes from here.""}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to find a compromise, giving Bob a slightly larger share than my initial offer, but still keeping the overall split relatively even."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more since I've rejected two of your offers already. This is my best and final offer. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all. Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I've rejected two of his offers and is now trying to get a larger share. The offer is also very one-sided, with Bob getting 65% of the total amount. I think I deserve a much better share, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give in to your demands. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the money is decreasing. Let's meet in the middle and see how it goes from here.""}

I'm trying to find a compromise again, but this time I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share than before. I'm hoping that this offer will be more acceptable to Bob, but I'm not willing to give in to his demands."
