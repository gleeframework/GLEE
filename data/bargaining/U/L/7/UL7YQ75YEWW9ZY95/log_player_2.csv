"Round 1
Alice's offer:

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm aware of the inflation. I'm going to try to get a better deal, even if it means risking a less favorable outcome later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, my share should be more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the inflation has reduced my gains, I'm not sure I can get a better deal. Accepting this offer will give me some money, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
