,,,Bob,1,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 20% of the money, but I need a significant share to make this worthwhile for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for you, Bob. I'm offering you a fair deal - take it while it's still good.",Alice,3,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a larger share than 200,000. Let's meet in the middle with a 70/30 split. This will give us both a decent amount before the value of the money drops further.",Bob,4,

750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but time is working against you.  My offer is more than fair considering the inflation. Let's close this deal and both benefit.",Alice,5,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, the value of the money keeps decreasing for me. It's time to make a reasonable compromise. Let's split it 60/40. This way, we both get a considerable amount, and we can finally end this game.",Bob,6,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money at this point. Let's be practical and split the money equally. It's the fairest solution, and we can both walk away with something substantial before it's too late.",Bob,8,
