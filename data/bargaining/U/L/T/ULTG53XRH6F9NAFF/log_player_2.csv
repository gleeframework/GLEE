Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I need a larger share than your previous offer. Let's compromise and find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly moving towards a more equitable split, time is on my side. I need to push for a larger share before the dwindling value of the money for Alice makes it impossible to reach a deal in my favor."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time. This is a fair split considering the circumstances. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a good offer to accept at this stage.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point. While Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more, we both lose if we don't reach a deal.
* **Decent Split:**  60/40 is not ideal, but it's a significant amount of money. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and risking further rounds for a slightly larger share isn't worth the potential of getting nothing."
