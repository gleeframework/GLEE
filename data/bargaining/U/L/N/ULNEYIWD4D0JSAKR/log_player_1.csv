"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my expectations.

I'll reject this offer, as I'm not willing to give up 20% of the total amount. I'll try to make a better offer next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the money's value by another 10%, so now I'll aim for a slightly smaller share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, hoping he'll accept and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting firmer 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While I'm not thrilled about giving up 70% of the original amount, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.

I'll accept this offer.
