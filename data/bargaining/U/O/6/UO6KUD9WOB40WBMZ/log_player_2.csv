"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the inflation affecting Alice more than me, I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation hits you harder, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against us both, Bob.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll take a small hit from my previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer as well. Since the inflation affects Alice more, her offer of 55/45 doesn't compensate enough for the loss of value on her end. I'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on your end, I believe a 57/43 split is more appropriate. It's time for us to come to an agreement before the value drops further for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. We're both losing out because of the inflation. Let's just split it evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer as well. Since the inflation has significantly reduced the value of Alice's gain, an even split doesn't accurately reflect the current situation. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the substantial impact of inflation on your end, with your gain now worth 18.55% less, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a reasonable and fair offer at this point. It's time for us to conclude the negotiations.""}"
