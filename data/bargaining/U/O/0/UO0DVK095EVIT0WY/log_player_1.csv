"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a 95/5 split in my favor, knowing that the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds. It's a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid the potential of getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer gives me a larger share than the previous round, I'm still losing out significantly. I'm banking on the fact that inflation is hitting Bob harder and I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to 60/40, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. While inflation is affecting me negatively, I believe Bob is experiencing even more substantial losses, making this offer attractive for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still losing out compared to the initial round, Bob's offer is increasingly attractive with the inflation hitting him hard. It's better to secure a 45/55 split now rather than risk getting a worse offer in the next round."
