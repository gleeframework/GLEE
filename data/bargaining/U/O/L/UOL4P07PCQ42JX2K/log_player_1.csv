"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, but I'm open to negotiations!""
}
```

This is a relatively fair starting offer, with me getting 60% and Bob getting 40%. I'm leaving room for negotiation, so Bob can either accept or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we'll face if we go another round. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer is actually more generous to me than it initially seems, since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while the money Bob gains is worth 10% less.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
