60.0,40.0,"Let's start fair. I propose we split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share since I'm making the first offer.  What do you think?",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,I'm going to counter with a 60/40 split in my favor. It's fair considering I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's be reasonable and end this quickly.,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Okay, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a decent share of the money after inflation.  What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 55 and you get 45.  This is fair considering the inflation and the fact that I'm making the offer.  Let's wrap this up.,Bob,4,
