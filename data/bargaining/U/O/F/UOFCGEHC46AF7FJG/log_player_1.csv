"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose an even split of $50 for each of us. This seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly to 55, hoping this will be more appealing to Bob.  The inflation is starting to take effect, and we need to find a way to split the money before it's worth too little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still not happy with this division, and I'm hopeful that I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation is accelerating, and we both need to find a solution quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my share to 60, taking into account the increasing inflation.  This feels like a reasonable compromise considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money.  Let's find a solution before it's too late!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, I recognize the value of the money is rapidly declining. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure some money before it becomes worthless."
