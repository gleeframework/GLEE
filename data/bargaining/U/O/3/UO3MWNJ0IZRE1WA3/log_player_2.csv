Let's see if I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice a smaller share, hoping she'll accept. Let's see how it goes!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

After losing my initial offer, I'm willing to accept this deal. It's still a decent gain for me, and the inflation is starting to bite."
