"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This way, I'll get 40% and Bob will get 60% of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 3000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 7000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round. 

I'll accept this offer.
