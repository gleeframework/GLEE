"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to get more this round! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm being offered only $3,000 while Bob gets $7,000. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to get a fair share!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm being offered only $4,000 while Bob gets $6,000. The inflation is affecting me more and more, and I'm starting to get worried about the value of my share. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

I'm proposing a 50/50 split again, but this time I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and accept a split that's closer to his previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it."
