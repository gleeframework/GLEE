"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to share the wealth, but I need a more significant portion to make it worth my while.  This offer allows us both to profit, and I believe it's fair given the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
