"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the effective amount is now $8,000. I'll make an offer that's a bit more aggressive.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 36% less now, so the effective amount is $6,400. Alice's offer is 50/50, which seems reasonable considering the reduced value of money. I'll accept.
