"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. The current offer doesn't seem very fair, and I think I can do better. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more in my favor, but still reasonable considering the decreasing value of money for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be more fair, considering the inflation!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40% after the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer because I think I can still get a better deal. Since the money is worth less to Alice with each passing round, I'll try to take advantage of that and see if I can get a more favorable offer in the next round. Alice is already feeling the effects of inflation, so I'll try to use that to my advantage. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nConsidering the inflation is affecting Alice's gains, I'll try to make an offer that takes that into account while still being somewhat reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you hard, let's adjust accordingly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, or we'll both lose more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on Alice's gains, I think I can push for a better deal. Alice is losing a substantial amount of value with each passing round, so I'll try to use this to my advantage. Splitting it evenly might seem fair on the surface, but given the current circumstances, I believe I can negotiate a more favorable outcome. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nGiven the substantial impact of inflation on Alice's gains, I'll make an offer that reflects this new dynamic. Alice is under pressure to accept a deal before the value of her potential gains decreases further.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, let's be realistic about the split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid losing everything.  Let's finish this before we both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the current situation, I think this offer is reasonable. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of Alice's gains, and she's willing to take a smaller share to avoid losing everything. While I could try to push for an even better deal, there's a risk that Alice might reject it and we'd both end up with nothing. I'd rather secure a guaranteed 60% of the original amount than risk losing everything. It's time to accept the offer and conclude the game."
