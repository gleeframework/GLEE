"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'm looking at a gain of $4,500 (90% of $5,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I don't want to give him a 60% share, that's too much. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round, so I'm looking at a gain of $4,050 (81% of $5,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep a bit more for myself."
