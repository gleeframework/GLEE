Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, Bob, but your last offer was too low. This is a fairer split that still allows you to come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is getting better, and I don't want to risk losing too much to inflation."
