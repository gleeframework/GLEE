"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the unequal split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim to maximize my gain.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
