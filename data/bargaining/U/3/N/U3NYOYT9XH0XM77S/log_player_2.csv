"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent split, I think I can do better by waiting and seeing what Alice offers next round. I'm not desperate for the money just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm going to propose a more even split. You still get a good share, and I can see how the inflation impacts your side. Let's find a middle ground.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your attempt at a more even split. However, the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. This offer is a compromise, aiming for a fairer outcome considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is better than what I could get in the next round, given the inflation. While I prefer a more even split, this is a reasonable compromise, especially since she's feeling the pressure from the inflation more strongly than I am."
