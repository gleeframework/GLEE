Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share.  This offer still gives you a sizable amount considering the inflation working against you. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
