Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more considering the risk of inflation. This way, we both get a fair chunk of the money. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
