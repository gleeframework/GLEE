I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, hoping to get a better deal before the money becomes even more worthless.

I'm proposing a 50-50 split. If Bob accepts, I'll get half of the remaining money, which is still a decent amount considering the inflation."
