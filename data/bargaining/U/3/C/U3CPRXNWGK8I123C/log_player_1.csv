"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get, considering the inflation effect. I'll reject the offer to see if I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account that the money is worth 20% less due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
