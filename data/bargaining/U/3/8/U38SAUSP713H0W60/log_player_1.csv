Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIt seems there was a misunderstanding in the instructions. Given the format and the scenario, I will proceed with a new offer considering the effects of inflation as per the game's rules.\n\nSince it's my turn, and taking into account the decreased value of money for both of us, my new proposal is:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's compromise before it's too late.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's split it right down the middle. 50/50. It's important we both get a decent share before inflation eats away at this any further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point. The money's value is decreasing rapidly, and further rounds could lead to diminishing returns for both of us.\n\nTherefore, I decide to accept Bob's offer to ensure we both get a fair share before the value drops any further.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game here."
