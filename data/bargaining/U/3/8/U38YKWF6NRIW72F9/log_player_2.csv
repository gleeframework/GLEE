"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40. We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 60/40 split right off the bat. I'm going to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer. Let's start with that.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly this time.  We're both losing value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
With the inflation, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. I'll take the 50/50 split, it's the best I can get at this point."
