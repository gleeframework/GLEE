"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $600,000 and Bob will get $400,000, with the message ""Let's divide it fairly, I'll take a bit more"". Let me know if Bob accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair deal. This is a good offer, take it before inflation eats into it! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Since the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, and considering Bob's offer gives me less than what I initially proposed for myself, I'll choose to proceed to the next round to try and get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway from my first offer, but don't wait for more!""}\n\nI'll propose taking $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000, with the message ""I'll meet you halfway from my first offer, but don't wait for more!"". Since Bob's money is decreasing in value due to inflation, and I met him halfway from my initial offer, I believe this is a reasonable proposal. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's almost like splitting it evenly, but with inflation, it's the best you'll get! 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven that the money is worth the same for me as in the first round, and Bob's offer of $490,000 is closer to an even split, I'll accept this offer. With the impact of inflation on Bob's gains, it seems like a reasonable compromise, and further rounds might not yield a significantly better outcome for me. Let's conclude the game with this offer!"
