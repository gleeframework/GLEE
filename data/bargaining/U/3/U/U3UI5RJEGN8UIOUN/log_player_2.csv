Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your split seems unfair in the long run. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that the money devalues faster for you, making a more even deal over time.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns. How about 58/42? It acknowledges the inflation difference but still gives me a slight edge considering it's my turn to propose. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
