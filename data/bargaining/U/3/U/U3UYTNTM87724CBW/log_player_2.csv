"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. Let's close the deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to significantly eat into my potential gains. Accepting Alice's offer of $425,000, while not ideal, is better than risking even further losses in subsequent rounds."
