Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the time pressure, Alice, so I'm willing to negotiate. How about a 48/52 split? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is better than his potential offer in the next round, but I'm aiming for a better outcome. I'm hoping he'll get more desperate as the rounds go on and the inflation hurts him more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6300,
""bob_gain"": 3700,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob.  I'm willing to take a slight hit to get this done.  This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm proposing a 46/54 split.  Let's be realistic and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a larger gain than holding out and risking getting nothing. The inflation is increasingly hurting Bob, but it's also starting to impact my potential gains significantly. It's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk losing everything."
