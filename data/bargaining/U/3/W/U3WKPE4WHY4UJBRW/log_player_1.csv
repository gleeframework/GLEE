"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation means that Bob's offer is actually pretty good. Accepting this offer is the safest option to ensure I get some money, as rejecting could lead to even worse offers for me in the future."
