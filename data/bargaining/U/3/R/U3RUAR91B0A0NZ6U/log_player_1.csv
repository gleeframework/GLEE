"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start. I figure he might be tempted to take it since the money will be worth less to me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even with the inflation, getting half the money is a good deal. I don't want to risk getting nothing if we keep going."
