Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's fairer than your initial offer and still accounts for the risk of inflation.

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
