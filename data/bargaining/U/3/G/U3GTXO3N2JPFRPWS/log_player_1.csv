"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my effective gain is $900,000 x 0.95 = $855,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the idea of taking only $200,000, especially since it's worth less than what I initially proposed. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to increase my chances of getting a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share now, but I'm not getting any younger. Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than the initial $1,000,000, my effective gain is $900,000 x 0.8554 = $771,086.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not thrilled with the idea of taking only $400,000, especially since it's worth even less than my previous proposal. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the inflation and the previous offers.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up yet. Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 22.62% less than the initial $1,000,000, my effective gain is $900,000 x 0.7778 = $700,020.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about splitting it 50/50, especially since it's worth even less than my previous proposal. However, it's a relatively fair offer, and I'm running out of time. I'll accept this offer to avoid risking getting nothing.
