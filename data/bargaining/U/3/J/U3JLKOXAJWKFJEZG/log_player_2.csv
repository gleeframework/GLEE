Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob, but I need a bigger piece of the pie.  Let's split this evenly, with a slight edge for me to reflect the inflation difference.  This is my final offer before the money depreciates further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's crucial to remember that the money is depreciating faster for me than it is for her. Accepting a less favorable split now will hurt more in the long run. I need to push for a better deal while there's still time."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation too. Let's meet in the middle this time, I'm willing to give up a bit more to ensure we both get something decent. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  

The effects of inflation are becoming severe. While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, accepting Alice's offer guarantees me $450,000. If I reject her offer and fail to secure a better deal in the following rounds, the value of the money will further decrease, potentially leaving me with even less.  It's a risky move to decline at this point."
