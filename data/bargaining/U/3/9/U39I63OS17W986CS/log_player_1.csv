"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I propose to keep almost all the money, leaving just $1 for Bob.  This is a very aggressive opening offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, accepting this offer is the best strategic move. Bob's offer is significantly better than what I proposed in the previous round, and the risk of getting nothing if I reject is too high."
