"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly. A 70/30 split seems fair to me. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation we'll both face in the next rounds. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is going in the wrong direction. I'm willing to settle for 65/35, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 35 now, rather than risk getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
