"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, giving Bob a decent share while still securing the majority for myself. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal.  I'm not happy with this, but I'm willing to keep playing and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  While Bob's offer was not ideal, I believe a 70/30 split is a fairer compromise considering the inflation we're facing.  Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to Bob and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is still less than what I initially proposed, the inflation is really starting to take its toll. I don't want to risk losing even more money, so I'll accept this offer.  It's better than nothing at this point."
