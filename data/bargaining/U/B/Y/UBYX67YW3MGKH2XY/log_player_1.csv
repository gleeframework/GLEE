"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to reassess the offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll consider the effective gains as follows:

My gain: 500000 * 0.95 = 475000
Bob's gain: 500000 * 0.9 = 450000

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll have to think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous, but still aiming to get a slight majority of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gains considering the inflation:

My gain: 450000 * 0.855 (1 - 0.145 = 0.855, 14.26% less than the original 1) = 382850
Bob's gain: 550000 * 0.727 (1 - 0.273 = 0.727, 27.1% less than the original 1) = 399350

With these calculations, I think I should accept Bob's offer. It seems like a reasonable split, considering the inflation.
