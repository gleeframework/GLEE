"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, my share of $5,000 is actually equivalent to $4,750 in the previous round's value. And since Bob's share is worth 20% less, his $5,000 is equivalent to $4,000 in the previous round's value.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a decent one, and I'll accept it.
