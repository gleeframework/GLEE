Let's see what kind of offer I can get by proposing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since we are both aware of the inflation, I'm assuming Alice will want to take the deal before the money loses even more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has reduced my potential gains, a 50/50 split is better than risking another round and losing more value.  Alice's offer is reasonable given the inflation, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal."
