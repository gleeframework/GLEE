"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal.  Even though the value of the money is decreasing, I'm still better off holding out and making a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

This offer still gives me a majority of the money, but it's a compromise from my first offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it since his offer was significantly less favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly, this offer is still worse than my last proposal.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm still holding out for a larger share, but I'm lowering my demand slightly to acknowledge the effects of inflation and the possibility of a deadlock. This offer gives me a decent share while still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting increasingly worse for me, but I'm still better off holding out. The value of the money is decreasing drastically, but I'm determined to get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

At this point, the value of the money has decreased significantly for both of us, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing with each passing round. This offer splits the money evenly, acknowledging the inflation impact and increasing chances of a stalemate."
