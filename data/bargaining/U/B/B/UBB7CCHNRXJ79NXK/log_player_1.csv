"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's start the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a good tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $400,000 instead of $500,000.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to accept a smaller share, let's see if I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be strategic with my offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a bit more!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's getting harder to be generous with inflation! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is worth a whopping 48.8% less than in the first round! I need to be careful with this one.

I'll have to think about whether the smaller share is worth it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll accept this offer. The money is getting less valuable by the round, and I don't want to risk going into negative territory. This seems like a reasonable compromise."
