"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time, 55 for me, 45 for you. We both get more than the previous round, so win-win! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money's value, I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. The 45% I'd get is worth 10% less than the 40% I could have gotten in the first round, due to the inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than the 60% he could have gotten in the first round.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
