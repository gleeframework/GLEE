"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better deal for me 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I'm hoping to get a better deal, especially considering the inflation is affecting me more severely than Bob. I'll wait for the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need something reasonable""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 580,000$ and keeping 420,000$ for myself. The message is a bit more assertive, hoping Bob will understand that I'm trying to find a balance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be careful with my decision. Bob's offer is similar to his previous one, but I'll have to think about whether it's better than my previous offer.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, although it's not ideal, it's a relatively stable amount, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with even lower values."
