"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and leave $2,000 for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, considering we have 11 more rounds to negotiate."
