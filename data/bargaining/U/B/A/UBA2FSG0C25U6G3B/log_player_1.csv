"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure I'm taking the risk by being the first to offer, and it's a pretty good deal for Bob considering he gets something for nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation is already biting into my potential gains. Accepting this offer secures me a decent amount, and the risk of further inflation and rejection makes it a reasonable choice."
