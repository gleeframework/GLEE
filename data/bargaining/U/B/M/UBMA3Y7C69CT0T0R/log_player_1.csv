"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40, it's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, $40 is now worth 95% of the original $40, which is $38. Since Bob is getting $60, which is worth 100% of the original $60, he's getting a bigger share of the total value.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share of the remaining value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share than in the first round, but still trying to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $45 I would gain is worth 90.74% of the original $50, which is $45.37. Bob's $55 is worth 110% of the original $50, which is $55. Since I'm getting a smaller share of the total value, I'll reject this offer.

```

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
