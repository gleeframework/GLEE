"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, I'll be generous""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 30%. I'm being generous, but I'm also trying to get a decent share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it 51-49. I'll take the slightly bigger share this time, but it's still a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 49 is now worth 39.2 (since 80% of 49). Not bad, but I was hoping for more!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original 100$, which is now worth 48 (due to inflation) and Bob will get 40%. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob!"
