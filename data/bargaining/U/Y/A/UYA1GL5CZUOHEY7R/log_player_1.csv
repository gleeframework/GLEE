"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority this round, but I'm open to negotiations""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, hoping to get a good chunk of the money upfront. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority this round, but I'm hoping to get a better deal next time 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, especially since my money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll pass on this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
