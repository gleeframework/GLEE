60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think it's more fair to split it closer to the middle.  How about 55 for me and 45 for you?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's just split it evenly this time.  It's getting more complicated with the inflation and I don't want to keep going back and forth.  50-50 seems like the fairest solution.,Alice,3,
