"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20, and I'll take 80. You can do better in the next round, I'm sure!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can take 70, and I'll take 30. It's still a fair split, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I gain in this round is 70 * 0.9 = 63.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 70% of its original value, so the effective amount is $70.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split. You can take 45, and I'll take 55. Let's finalize the deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to take less than 40. I think you're being a bit greedy. I'll give you 60, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll budge. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so the effective amount is $72.9.

However, I'll calculate the actual gain considering the inflation from the first round:

$60 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9071 = $40.52

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
