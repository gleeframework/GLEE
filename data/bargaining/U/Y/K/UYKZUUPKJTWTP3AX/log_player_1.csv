Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer keeps the majority of the money for me, but it is still a generous offer to encourage Bob to accept and avoid the risk of losing money in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 8000, still giving Bob a decent amount. I believe this offer is fair and will encourage Bob to accept before the value of the money depreciates further."
