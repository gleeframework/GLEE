"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a pretty lopsided deal in the first round.  I figure Bob might accept it since he doesn't know about the inflation, but if he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, this is a much better deal for me than the first round.  I'll accept it."
