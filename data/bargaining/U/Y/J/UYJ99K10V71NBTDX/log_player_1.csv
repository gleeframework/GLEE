Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIt seems there's been a misunderstanding in the instructions. Given the format and the scenario, I will proceed as instructed, but I'll correct my response to fit the proper format for Round 3, considering the inflation and the game's progression.\n\nSince it's my turn again and considering the inflation, my offer should reflect the decreasing value of the money for me. However, my previous response was not aligned with the decreasing value due to inflation. Let me correct that and proceed according to the game's rules and the format requested.\n\nFor Round 3, considering the money is worth 5% less for me than in the previous round, my offer should adjust accordingly. However, my strategy also involves negotiation, so I'll make an offer that considers both the inflation and the negotiation aspect.\n\nHere's my corrected offer for Round 3, keeping in mind the format and the scenario:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 522500, ""bob_gain"": 477500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust and meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nThis offer takes into account the decreased value of the money for me due to inflation (a 5% decrease from my previous offer, adjusted for the game's dynamics), and it also tries to negotiate a better split, hoping Bob will see the fairness in the offer given the circumstances.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds to this offer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out and the value is diminishing. This offer is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of the money for me due to inflation, which is now 14.26% less than in the first round, and taking into account Bob's offer, I need to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus continuing the negotiation.\n\nGiven the current offer and the impact of inflation, I decide to reject Bob's offer from round 4, hoping that a better compromise can be reached in the next round that takes into account the diminishing value of the money for me.\n\nHere's my response:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow, it's my turn again for Round 5. Given the scenario and the need to adjust for inflation while trying to reach a mutually acceptable agreement, I'll make a new offer.
