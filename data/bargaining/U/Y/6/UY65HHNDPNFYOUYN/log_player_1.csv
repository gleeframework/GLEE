"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and equal division of the $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
