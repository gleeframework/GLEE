Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario with a clear strategy: maximize your own gains while minimizing the risk of rejection. In the first round, it's best to be aggressive and offer a distribution that benefits you significantly. While Bob could potentially reject this offer, the risk of him doing so is relatively low, as he has no information about how inflation will impact him and may want to avoid risking a worse outcome in the future."
