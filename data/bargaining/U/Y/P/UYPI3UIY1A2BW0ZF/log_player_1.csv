"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider a fair and reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more for me, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my offer is less attractive than before.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased purchasing power of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise: you get a bit more, but I'm still not giving up too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share this time, but still keeping a significant amount for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to take a toll on my potential earnings.

Considering the reduced values, I'll think carefully about this offer.

After weighing the options, I'll accept Bob's offer.
