Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice. But, I think we can both do better. Let's split the money equally.  We'll both get a good amount, and with the inflation, it's a win-win. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
