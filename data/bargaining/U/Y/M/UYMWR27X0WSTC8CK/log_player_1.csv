Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself, with a message encouraging a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it closer to even. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I initially offered Bob $450,000 and he rejected it, now Bob is offering me $450,000, which is worth 10% less due to inflation. Considering the decreased value, this offer isn't as appealing as my initial proposal. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn! I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation on both of us, I'll adjust my offer to make it more appealing to Bob while still favoring me. I'll propose that I receive $580,000 and Bob receive $420,000. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more attractive option and accept.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust and settle!""}"
