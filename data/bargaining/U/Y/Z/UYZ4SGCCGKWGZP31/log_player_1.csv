"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a pretty standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start the game and I can get my share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! With the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully. Since Bob is offering me 40, which is less than my initial offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
