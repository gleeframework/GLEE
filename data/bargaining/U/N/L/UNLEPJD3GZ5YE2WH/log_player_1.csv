Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a more balanced approach. It's still fair to both of us, but I believe it reflects our relative contributions to the overall outcome. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
