"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. I'll give you $300,000. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the current value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $500,000 is now equivalent to $450,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
