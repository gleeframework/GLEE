"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting offer was a bit too much in your favor. I propose a more balanced split that acknowledges the impact of inflation on your share as we progress. Let's settle this quickly and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
