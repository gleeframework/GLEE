"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a very aggressive first offer, aiming to get the majority of the money.  I'm banking on Bob being unsure of the game dynamics and potentially accepting it to avoid risk. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a direct mirror of my first offer.  This is interesting. It looks like he's trying to see if I'll cave due to inflation.  I'm not going to let him get away with that. I will reject and make my own offer in the next round. I'll try to be a bit more reasonable, but still keep the majority of the money.  I'll need to adjust for the inflation effect on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This offer is still fairly aggressive, but it takes into account the inflation from the previous round.  I'm aiming to maintain a comfortable lead while demonstrating a slight willingness to compromise.  Let's see if Bob is swayed by this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a direct mirror of my offer from the previous round, meaning he's still playing a game of ""mirror me"".  I'm not going to fall for that again.  I'll counter with a similar offer, but try to adjust for the inflation effect on my side. It's getting serious with the increasing inflation, and I need to start considering a more balanced approach."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

This offer is a slight decrease from my previous one.  I'm trying to balance my desire for a larger share with the increasing inflation and the fact that Bob is clearly stubborn.  This offer still gives me a significant advantage, but shows a bit more willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still mirroring my offers, but it's getting really serious with the inflation. I'm not going to accept this offer, but I also need to start considering a more balanced approach.  The inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, and I'm starting to run out of time. I need to find a way to compromise without losing too much."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is becoming a huge problem for me.  I need to find a way to compromise and quickly.  This offer is a 50/50 split. I'm hoping that Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this, as the inflation will only hurt him further if we keep playing."
