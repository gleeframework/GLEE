# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's a good idea to accept an offer where I would get only $200,000 while Bob would get $800,000. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one in the next round."

I'm not willing to accept an offer where I would get only $100,000 while Bob would get $900,000. The offer is too skewed in his favor, and I'll try to make a better one in the next round."
