"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original 100$, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $60. This is a fair starting point, and I'm giving Bob the opportunity to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share to start things off, but I think it's fair considering we both have a chance to propose later. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $49 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $46.65.

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the original 100$, which is $45, and I'll take the remaining 55%, which is $55. This is a slightly more favorable offer for me, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
