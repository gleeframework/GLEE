I propose to keep 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair start, as I am taking the larger share but leaving Bob with a decent amount.  Let's see if he accepts!"

I'm going to offer Bob 190,000 dollars this time.  Since I'm taking a smaller share, I'm offering him a bit more to hopefully encourage him to accept.  I'm still feeling confident that I can get a good deal."

Round 5

I'm offering Bob 271,000 dollars this time, even though he's been rejecting my offers. I believe that with the increasing inflation, he's more likely to accept a larger offer.  Let's see what happens."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not going to accept this offer. Bob is being very greedy, taking advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal, and I won't give in to his bullying."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900} 
```

I'm offering Bob 343,900 dollars this time.  While the inflation is eating away at my potential gains, I'm still trying to be reasonable.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally realize that we both need to compromise, especially with how quickly things are changing."
