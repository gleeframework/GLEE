"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want the majority of the money. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 1000$ is something, it's a very small amount compared to what's at stake. I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split this fairly. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need to ensure I get a good portion as well. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a good chunk of the money. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to take its toll. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent sum, and the risk of getting nothing at the end is too high."
