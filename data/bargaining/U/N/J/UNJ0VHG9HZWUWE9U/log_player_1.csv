Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Although this is the same offer Bob gave in Round 1, I need to consider the impact of inflation.  At this point, accepting $4000 is better than risking getting an even lower amount in future rounds."
