"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, then we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me $900,000 and leaves Bob with $100,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, I'm taking a larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject his offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to let him walk away with the majority of the money!"

  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, Bob. Let's find a fair middle ground.""
}

I'm taking a slightly more conservative approach this time, but still trying to find a balance."

# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings!

Considering the drastic reduction in the value of my potential gain, I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept such a paltry share, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly!"

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a balance, but you're not making it easy. Let's meet in the middle.""

# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the drastic reduction in the value of my potential gain, I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 6:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic, but you're not making it easy. Let's try to find a fair split.""

 ""message"": ""I'm not going to back down. Let's split it 50/50, it's the only fair way.""
