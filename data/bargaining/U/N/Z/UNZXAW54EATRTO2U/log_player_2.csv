"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair division, with me getting 90% and you getting 10%. Let's start this game off right! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for me!  The money will be worth less in future rounds, but I can aim for a much larger share than 10%."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's too greedy. I'm offering you 350,000. Take it or leave it.  We both lose if this drags on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Let's be reasonable. I'll take 60% and you take 40%. It's a better deal than your last offer, and we can avoid losing more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While it's a better offer, I'm still confident I can get more than 40%. Time is running out, but I need to push for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. 55% for me, 45% for you.  It's a fair split, and we need to close this deal before inflation eats away at the value.""}
