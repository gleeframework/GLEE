"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal!""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob $4500, which is a bit less than half, but still a significant amount. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer and avoid further rounds, which would lead to a decrease in the value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a good share, and we don't need to waste time with more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 5% less in this round, and I was initially aiming for $5500, accepting $5000 now seems less favorable. Additionally, Bob's share being worth 20% less than in the first round puts more pressure on him to close the deal sooner rather than later. I will reject this offer and propose a new division in the next round, hoping to capitalize on Bob's increasing urgency due to the higher inflation rate affecting his share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the inflation is hitting you harder. Let's end this before it gets worse!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased my proposed share to $5800, while decreasing Bob's share to $4200. The message acknowledges the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept the offer before the value of his share decreases further. By suggesting we end the negotiations, I'm hoping to appeal to Bob's concern about the diminishing value of his potential gain."
