"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money has decreased, I am still confident that I can secure a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
``` 

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, still aiming for a good deal but acknowledging that Bob's proposal suggests a higher value for him. I'm hoping this more balanced offer will encourage him to accept."
