"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll try to offer a slightly more favorable ratio to her. However, I'll also take into account the 5% inflation, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more significantly than Alice. I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Since Alice's offer is 58/42, it's not significantly different from her previous offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll take a chance and accept this offer.
