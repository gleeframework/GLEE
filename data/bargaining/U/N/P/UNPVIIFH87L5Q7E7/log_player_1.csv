"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly. Since my offer is quite favorable to me, I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me now, and the inflation means I'm losing more money than him with each round.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly from my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground that will be appealing to Bob while still being favorable to me.  Given the inflation, I need to get this game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly less favorable to me, and the inflation has made it much more detrimental to my overall gains. I will continue to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to make a final attempt to get a deal done. Inflation is hitting me hard, and I need to secure a decent amount of money. While I'm still offering a significant share to Bob, this is my best compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly less than I initially hoped for, I've lost a lot of money due to inflation. I can't afford to continue negotiating, and this offer is still better than what I'd get if I keep rejecting offers. I'm forced to accept it."
