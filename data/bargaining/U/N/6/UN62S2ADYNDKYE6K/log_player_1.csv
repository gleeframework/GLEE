Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should go 60-40, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I'm Alice, I will respond with a decision in JSON format:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Although the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I still think I can get a better deal. I initially offered 60-40 in my favor, and Bob is now offering 60-40 in his favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but I don't want to give up too much yet. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
