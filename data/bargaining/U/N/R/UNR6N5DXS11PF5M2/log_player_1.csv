"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 45/55 in your favor. This takes into account the inflation effect and aims for a fair division given the uncertainty of future offers. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
