I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000. This is a fair starting point, ensuring a significant majority of the money goes to me while still giving Bob a chance to get something."

I'm going to reject this offer. While inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I would gain, I am still better off holding out and hoping for a better offer in future rounds. I'm confident I can secure a larger share of the remaining money."

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential earnings, but I'm still better off holding out for a better offer. I believe I can still secure a larger share of the remaining money."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

With each round, the value of the money decreases due to inflation. I'm going to propose a 60/40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000.  This offer still leaves a significant portion of the money with me, while offering Bob a greater share than the previous rounds. It's time to start making some concessions."
