Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're down to the wire. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this goes on any longer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

This is a tough one! While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, here's why Alice should accept:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is very high if she rejects.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Inflation is eating into Alice's potential gains with every passing round. Even if she manages to secure a slightly better deal later, the value might be significantly less than what she gets now. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob's ""take it or leave it"" message suggests he's unlikely to budge further. 

It's better for Alice to secure a guaranteed $5000 (even with inflation) than risk walking away with nothing."
