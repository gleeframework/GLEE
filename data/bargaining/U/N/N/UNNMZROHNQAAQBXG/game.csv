,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,My turn. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at the value.,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to let you take the majority. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the bigger share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Okay, let's be reasonable. I'll accept the 55/45 split, but with me getting the larger share this time.  The clock is ticking, and it's hurting my potential gains more than yours.",Bob,4,
