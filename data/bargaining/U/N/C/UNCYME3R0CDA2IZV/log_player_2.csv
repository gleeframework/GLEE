Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a 50/50 split.  This is extremely fair given the circumstances. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is getting a slightly better deal, but with the time pressure and the inflation affecting her more, it's a good enough offer to accept.  It's close to the 50/50 split I was aiming for, and I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing at all."
