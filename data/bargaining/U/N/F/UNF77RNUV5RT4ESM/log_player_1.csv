"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very unequal offer.  Since I'm playing as Alice and the money depreciates faster for Bob, I'm aiming for the biggest chunk of the pie.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I still want the biggest share possible, Bob's offer is considerably more fair than my first attempt, and the fact that my money is worth less with each round makes this a better deal for me."
