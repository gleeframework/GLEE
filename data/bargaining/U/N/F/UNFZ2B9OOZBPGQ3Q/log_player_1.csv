"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $600,000, leaving Bob with $400,000. I've attached a message suggesting this as a fair split, considering we both want a significant share but also want to end the game early to minimize the impact of inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This offer ensures you still get a significant sum considering the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round or make a counteroffer that benefits me more. The difference in the impact of inflation between us (10% for me vs. 5% for Bob) means that with each passing round, the relative value of the money shifts slightly in my favor if I can force the game to continue. I'll make a new proposal in the next round, aiming to capitalize on this dynamic."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\nGiven the effects of inflation, the value of the money has decreased for both of us, but more so for me. However, I'm trying to find a middle ground that acknowledges this decrease while still aiming for a favorable split. This offer reflects a slight adjustment from my initial proposal, taking into account the reduced value of the money but still positioning myself for a larger share. The message emphasizes the reasonableness of this split under the current circumstances, aiming to persuade Bob to accept and end the game before further devaluation."
