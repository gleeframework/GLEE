It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next!"

# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still being stubborn, and her offer is still not fair considering the inflation. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Alice's offer is more reasonable now, taking inflation into account. I'm losing a significant amount with each round, so accepting this offer is the best option."
