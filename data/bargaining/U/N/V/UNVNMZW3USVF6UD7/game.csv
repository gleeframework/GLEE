4200.0,5800.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation, I believe a slightly higher share for me is reasonable. This offer still allows both of us to walk away with a substantial amount, considering the decreasing value over time.",Bob,4,

3400.0,6600.0,"In this final round, considering the drastic impact of inflation and the fact that this is our last opportunity to walk away with anything, I'm making an offer that I believe is as fair as possible under the circumstances.
