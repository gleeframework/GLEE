"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince I'm playing as Bob, I'll reject the offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. The 5% inflation rate for me is relatively low compared to Alice's 20%, so I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to concede a bit, but I think my offer is still fair given the inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the inflation is taking its toll, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Alice's concession is not enough to offset the difference in inflation rates between us. I'll reject this offer and try to get a more favorable deal in the next round. The increasing disparity in the value of the money due to inflation might pressure Alice to offer more or accept a less favorable deal in the subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""The inflation is affecting us both, but I think I'm being generous considering the difference in our inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get worried about how much inflation is affecting us both. Let's meet in the middle this time, and split it 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because Alice is still trying to get the larger share despite the fact that inflation is affecting her more severely. Meeting in the middle at this point doesn't seem fair given the significant difference in how inflation is impacting our potential gains. I'll try to leverage this to get a better deal in the next round. The pressure of losing value with each round should start to weigh more heavily on Alice, given her higher inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your end, I think this is a fair adjustment. We're running out of time.""}"
