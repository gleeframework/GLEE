Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are adding up!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a good one. We're both getting an equal share, and it's a fair split.
