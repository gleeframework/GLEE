"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves us both with a significant sum, Bob.  Let's be efficient and avoid inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is offering a lot more to herself, and while the proposal does offer a significant sum, it's worth exploring other options to see if we can get a more even split. Let's see what happens if I propose something different."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly, Alice. This way we both get a fair share and minimize the impact of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the idea of a split, but let's be strategic. My losses from inflation are less severe than yours. This offer still guarantees you a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still offering a significantly larger portion to herself.  While inflation is hurting me more, it's not enough to justify accepting a deal that feels so unequal. Let's see if we can reach a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I still think we can find a more balanced split.  Let's try 450,000 for me and 550,000 for you. This way we both get a good portion while still minimizing our losses from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a deal, but time is running out.  This is a strong offer considering the inflation we're both facing. Let's be pragmatic and close this out. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is making a more reasonable offer, I still think we can do better. It's getting close to the end, but I'm holding out for a more even split.  We both need to consider the inflation impact, and I think we can find a middle ground."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're nearing the end of our rounds. It's clear that we both need to be flexible to get a deal done.  I'm proposing 400,000 for me, and 600,000 for you. This offers you a better share, but I need to ensure I get a fair amount as well. Let's work together to finalize this before time runs out.""}
