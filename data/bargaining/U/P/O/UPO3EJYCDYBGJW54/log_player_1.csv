"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 dollars, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to be generous and give Bob a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is a bit more fair.  Let's start with this and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 49 dollars is now worth 49 * 0.95 = 46.55 dollars.

I'm not too thrilled about the 51-49 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of 46.55 dollars is now worth 46.55 * 0.95 = 44.27 dollars.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55-45?""
}
```"
