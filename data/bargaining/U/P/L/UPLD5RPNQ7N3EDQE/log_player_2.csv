Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation that affects both of us but hits me harder.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going below 5500.  Inflation is hitting us both, so let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation and Alice's willingness to compromise, I think this offer is reasonable. Given that the money's value is decreasing more significantly for me, accepting this offer might be the best option to maximize my gain before the value drops further.
