"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more balanced, but still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll reevaluate the offer.

Since my gain is worth 10% less, $200,000 is now equivalent to $180,000 in the first round's value. And Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 95% of the original, which is $760,000.

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but it's still a decent proposal. I'll decide to reject it, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a new proposal. Since my gain is now worth 90% of the original value (10% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I'm still looking for a better deal""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me halfway, but I'm still keeping my options open for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $700,000 in Round 3 is now worth 72.9% of the original value, which is approximately $729,000 (1,000,000 x 0.729). However, in Round 4, my gain is worth 72.9% of the original value, but also 27.1% less than the Round 3 value, so it's approximately $525,000 (729,000 x 0.271).

Bob's gain of $300,000 in Round 3 is now worth 85.74% of the original value, which is approximately $342,222 (1,000,000 x 0.8574). However, in Round 4, Bob's gain is worth 85.74% of the original value, but also 14.26% less than the Round 3 value, so it's approximately $320,000 (342,222 x 0.9426).

Considering the actual values, Bob's offer of $450,000 for me and $550,000 for him is a relatively good deal. I'll accept it.
