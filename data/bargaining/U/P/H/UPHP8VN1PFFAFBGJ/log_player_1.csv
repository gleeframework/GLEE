"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with a tiny portion.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  If Bob accepts, I win big. If Bob rejects, I still have 11 rounds to try a different approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds."
