Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly bigger share""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm being generous and offering a slightly bigger share to myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
