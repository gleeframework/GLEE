"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it quickly.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept that! It's way too unfair, and there's still plenty of time left in the game. I'll make a counter-offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground. I'll reduce my share a bit, but I'm still aiming for a more fair division than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is really pushing his luck with these offers! I'm not going to give in. I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm going to try one more time to reach a compromise. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm not willing to accept anything less. Hopefully, Bob will see reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable. I'm not going to accept this and will counter with a fairer offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm starting to get concerned about the time. I'm hoping Bob will see that we need to reach a compromise soon or we'll both lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly stubborn! I'm starting to think he's trying to get as much as he can, even if it means we both end up with nothing. I'm going to make one last attempt at a fair offer in the next round, but if he rejects it, I'll have to accept that we'll both walk away empty-handed."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

This is my final offer.  It's a 50/50 split, the fairest possible division.  If Bob rejects this, we both get nothing. Let's see if he's finally willing to compromise."
