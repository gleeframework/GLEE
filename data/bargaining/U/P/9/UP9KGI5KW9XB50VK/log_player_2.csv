"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous offer for me.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's better to try and get a better deal than starting off with a massive disadvantage.  Let's see if Alice will make a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split.  We can work from there if you'd prefer something different."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split. Let's move closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to give you more, but I also need to ensure I get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than what I had previously proposed, and the inflation is starting to take a toll. It's time to secure some of this money."
