This is a tough one, but here's why I'm accepting:

* **Inflation is eating our profits:**  Every round we delay, the value decreases significantly. 
* **Alice is unlikely to offer more:** She's consistently aimed for a larger share. Waiting might force me to accept even less later. 
* **Something is better than nothing:** While not ideal, getting 43% now is better than risking a worse offer later, or even reaching a point where the money is almost worthless."
