# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth the same for me, but 20% less for Bob, his offer of 65 is actually worth less to him than it would have been in the first round. And his offer of 35 for me is quite low, if I do say so myself.\n\nI think I can do better than that in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.
