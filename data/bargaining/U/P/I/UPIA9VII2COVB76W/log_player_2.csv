Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
