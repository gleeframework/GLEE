"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how the game unfolds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80, you get 20, let's see if you like it 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

For Round 2, I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd rather not take a 4:1 split, let's see if I can do better next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

For Round 3, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority this time, see if you'll take it""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, hoping he'll take it and we can wrap up the game!"
