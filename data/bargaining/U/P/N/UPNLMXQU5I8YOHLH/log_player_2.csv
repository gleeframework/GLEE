"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives you a significant portion while recognizing my initiative in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer, Bob. It's a decent starting point, but we can do better.  We need to factor in the inflation. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""This is my offer, Alice.  It's fair considering the inflation. I'm willing to compromise, but we need to finish this quickly before the money loses more value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and it's depreciating fast.  My previous offer was more generous, but this is still a fair split considering the circumstances. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than the last round, and the money is losing value quickly. I'm accepting, Bob.  It's time to close this deal."
