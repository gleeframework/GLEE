"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to go for a more equitable split here, giving you a small amount just to be polite.  Accept this and we both get something, but it might not last long. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
