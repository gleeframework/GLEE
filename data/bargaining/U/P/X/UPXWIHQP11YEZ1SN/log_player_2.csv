"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer, Bob is a smart negotiator and knows he can get a better deal than a 40/60 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm the one making the proposal this round. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still need a larger share to account for the inflation working against me. How about a 55/45 split? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is still confident he can get a better deal.  He's going to try to push for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 52/48 split is more equitable considering the inflation we're both facing. Let's meet in the middle this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a 53/47 split. This is a compromise, but it's fair considering the circumstances.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob realizes that time is running out, and the inflation is affecting both of them significantly. While he prefers a more even split, accepting a 53/47 split is a better outcome than potentially getting nothing if they run out of rounds."
