"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% and take the rest. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about giving up 80% of the money, but it's better than going to the next round with even less value.

I accept the offer.
