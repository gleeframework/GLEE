Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point.  Let's try a 70/30 split.  This is a good opportunity for us both to walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, the deal still heavily favors her. It's important to remain firm and demonstrate that a more equitable split is necessary. Accepting a heavily skewed deal early sets a bad precedent for future rounds."
