"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70-30, I'll try to adjust my offer to be slightly more favorable to myself, considering the ongoing inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the value of the money has decreased so much 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of Bob's offer, I'll think carefully about this proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
