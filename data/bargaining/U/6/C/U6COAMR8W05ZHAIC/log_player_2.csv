**Reasoning:**

While Alice is ""getting closer to the middle ground,"" it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially when considering the impact of inflation on her gains. I'm holding out for a better deal as time goes on."

# Alice gain: 5400

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and the inflation is working heavily in my favor.  There's no reason for me to accept anything less than a 50/50 split, and even then, I might hold out for a bit more."

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous - take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm putting the pressure on Alice.  The inflation is heavily in my favor, and she's running out of time to secure any significant portion of the money. This offer is slightly in my favor, but the quickly diminishing value for her might make her reconsider."

# Alice's message: Trying to find a middle ground considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation, and this offer is very close to a 50/50 split considering the reduced value of her share. While I could push for more, there's a real risk she'll hold out and we'll both get nothing. It's a good time to take the deal and guarantee a win."
