  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
