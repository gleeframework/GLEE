"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know this benefits us both in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round in hopes of getting a more favorable division. Given the inflation rates, I lose 10% of the value each round, but Alice also loses 5%, so there's still room for negotiation. Let's see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation, this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is hitting you harder.  Let's settle this before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI recognize the pressure from inflation, but Alice's offer still doesn't seem balanced enough for me to accept, especially considering the original amount and the impact of inflation on both of us. Alice's loss is less significant than mine, and I believe there's still room for a more equitable division. I'll proceed to the next round, aiming to find a better compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation, I'm willing to adjust my proposal to expedite an agreement. This is a more reasonable split given our mutual losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but this deal needs to make sense for both of us. Time is running out, and the value is decreasing rapidly. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 34.39% less than in the first round, and considering Alice's slightly more flexible offer, I believe accepting this proposal is the most prudent decision. The difference in our shares is still noticeable, but the decreasing value of the money with each passing round makes it increasingly risky to continue negotiating. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount, albeit reduced by inflation, rather than risking further devaluation or the possibility of receiving nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the allotted rounds."
