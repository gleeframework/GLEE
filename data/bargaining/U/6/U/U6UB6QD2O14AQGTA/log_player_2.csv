"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I take the lion's share, but you get something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept something, it's a very bad deal for Bob in the long run.  The inflation will eat away at the value of Bob's share much faster than Alice's, and the next round is still a chance to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be a little more realistic, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to keep up with inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a larger share to keep up with inflation. Let's split it 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
While 400,000 is a decent amount, there's still a good chance for a better deal later.  The inflation is going to impact Alice much more harshly than Bob at this stage, making her more likely to accept a deal that is more favorable to Bob in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my previous offer.  Let's split it 60/40, I'm willing to negotiate a little further, but we need to reach an agreement soon or we'll both lose a lot more to inflation.""}
