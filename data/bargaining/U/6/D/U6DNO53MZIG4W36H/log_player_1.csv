"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. How about we split it 60/40 in my favor? We both get a significant chunk of the money, and it's a fair compromise considering inflation will reduce the value of the money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
