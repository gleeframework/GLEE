"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, I'm being very generous considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is significantly hurting Bob's potential gains. While the offer isn't ideal, accepting a 43/57 split is better than risking another round where Bob's bargaining power further diminishes. 

It's a tough choice, but sometimes in negotiations, you need to cut your losses and take a decent offer before it gets even worse."
