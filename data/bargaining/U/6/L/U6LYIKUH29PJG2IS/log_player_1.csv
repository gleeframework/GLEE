"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. You'll still get a good amount!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the game's conditions. I want to create a sense of fairness and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, while also taking into account the fact that the money is worth less to him with each passing round. By framing it as a 60-40 split, I'm trying to make the offer more palatable and increase the chances of Bob accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate will affect me more.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's heavily skewed in his favor, and the inflation rate will indeed affect him more. However, accepting this offer would mean I'm losing out on a significant amount of money. By rejecting it, I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to make a slight concession. Let's meet in the middle and get this done!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more generous offer to Bob, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. By framing it as a concession and a willingness to meet in the middle, I'm trying to create a sense of cooperation and increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer. At the same time, I'm still trying to maintain a relatively favorable split for myself."
