"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm trying to get the majority of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about this offer... It's a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
