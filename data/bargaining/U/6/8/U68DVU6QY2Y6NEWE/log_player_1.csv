 I propose a 990,000 to 10,000 split.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, knowing that he can always reject and have a chance to propose a better deal for himself in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, I believe I can still get a better deal. I will propose a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50/50 split.  While the inflation means we both are getting less, this is the fairest way to divide the money, and hopefully Bob will agree."
