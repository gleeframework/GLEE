"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the bigger share this time, but I promise to be more generous in the future if we keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While she promises to be more generous later, there's no guarantee. It's better to push for a more equitable split from the start."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This split ensures we both benefit significantly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try an even split this time. I think it's the fairest way to move forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a much better deal than Alice's initial offer. While it might not be the absolute best I could get if I keep pushing, the effects of inflation are starting to hurt Alice's potential gains more than mine. Accepting a 50/50 split now ensures a reasonable payout for both of us."
