"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair split - 90% for me, 10% for you. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a terrible deal for Bob.  Even though Alice is calling it a ""fair split"", it's highly disadvantageous for Bob.  There's a lot of room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good share.""}
