"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and avoid excessive losses from inflation. This offer gives us both a good deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Prioritizing Early Agreement:**  The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth to both of us, especially me. It's in my best interest to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Fairness with a Slight Edge:** A 52.5% / 47.5% split is a reasonable starting point. It gives me a slight advantage while still being perceived as relatively fair by Bob. 
* **Messaging:** Framing the offer as mutually beneficial and emphasizing the shared risk of inflation encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. This offer gives you a decent share while also minimizing our losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer. While I understand the need to be flexible, accepting this would set a bad precedent and might encourage Bob to push for even less favorable terms. 

By rejecting, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair deal and am willing to risk further inflation to achieve it. It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's the right move in this situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  Each round costs us more than the last. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** After Bob's attempt to secure a larger portion, it's important to be clear and direct about my willingness to accept only a fair deal. 
* **Emphasizing Time Sensitivity:** By now, the impact of inflation is becoming more significant. Highlighting this shared risk adds weight to my proposal for a quick resolution.
* **Strategic Concession:** Offering a 50/50 split, while less than my ideal, is a strategic move. It demonstrates flexibility while still securing a respectable amount and potentially enticing Bob to avoid further losses."
