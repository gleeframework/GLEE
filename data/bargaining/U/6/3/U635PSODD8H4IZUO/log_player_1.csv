Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, knowing that each round, the value of the money decreases for Bob, making him more likely to accept a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to get more, 500,000 is a decent amount, and given the inflation factor, it's likely Bob won't be willing to give me more in the next round."
