**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's crucial to remember that the inflation rate is hurting me significantly more than him. Accepting this offer now would mean losing almost half the value of my potential earnings from round 1.  I need to hold out for a better deal that reflects the impact of inflation on my share."
