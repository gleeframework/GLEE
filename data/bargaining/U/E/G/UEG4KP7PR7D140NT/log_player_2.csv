"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split a bit more than half-half to account for the inflation, shall we? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  It's true that I'm getting a slightly better share right now, but I know that inflation will hit Alice harder.  I'm betting that she'll be more likely to accept a more even split in the future to avoid losing too much to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  Inflation is a factor, but I'd rather we both get a fair share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the need for fairness, but the inflation hits me harder. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would still prefer an even split, the inflation is becoming a real factor, and accepting this offer ensures I get at least something. It's a compromise that minimizes potential losses."
