"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. No need to negotiate.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about whether 400,000 is a good deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll try to make a more advantageous offer for myself, considering the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
