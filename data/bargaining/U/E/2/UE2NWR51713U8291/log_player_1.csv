"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and Bob gets the remaining 30%, which is $30. The message is a friendly nudge to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, my gain of $70 is still $70.

As for Bob's offer, his gain of $50 is worth 10% less than the $30 he would have gotten in the first round, which means his gain of $50 is equivalent to $27 in the first round. I think I can do better than that!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, my gain of $70 is still $70. But for Bob, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so his gain of $27 is worth 10% less than the $30 he would have gotten in the first round, which means his gain of $27 is equivalent to $27.27 in the first round.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the remaining $100, which is $75, and Bob gets the remaining 25%, which is $25."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need something in return! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, my gain of $70 is still $70.

As for Bob's offer, his gain of $40 is worth 27.1% less than the $30 he would have gotten in the first round, which means his gain of $40 is equivalent to $21.93 in the first round. I think I can do better than that!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, my gain of $70 is still $70. But for Bob, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the previous round, so his gain of $21.93 is worth 10% less than the $27.27 he would have gotten in the third round, which means his gain of $21.93 is equivalent to $19.73 in the third round.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm still willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the remaining $100, which is $80, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, let's find a middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, my gain of $70 is still $70.

As for Bob's offer, his gain of $45 is worth 40.95% less than the $30 he would have gotten in the first round, which means his gain of $45 is equivalent to $17.38 in the first round. I think I can do better than that!

However, I notice that my gain of $80 in the previous round is worth 20% less than the $70 I would have gotten in the first round, which means my gain of $80 is equivalent to $56 in the first round. This is actually lower than the $70 I would have gotten if I had accepted the first offer, and even lower than the $70 I would have gotten if I had accepted the second offer.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
