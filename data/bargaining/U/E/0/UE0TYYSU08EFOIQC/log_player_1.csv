Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 40

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Bob is feeling the pressure:** The inflation is significantly impacting Bob's potential gains. He's clearly more willing to compromise now.
* **You're securing your initial goal:** Your initial offer of 60/40 was already favorable to you, and you're now getting it.
* **Further delay risks a worse outcome:** There's no guarantee that Bob won't propose an even less favorable split in the next round if you reject his current offer."
