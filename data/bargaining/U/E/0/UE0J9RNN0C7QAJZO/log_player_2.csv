Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: 50/50 is still fair, despite the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me. Accepting now would mean losing out on potential gains if I hold out for a better offer in the next few rounds. Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the inflation hurts her more."
