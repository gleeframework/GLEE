"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end this game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining 60%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a chance to make a better deal, but I'm taking the lion's share this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a chance! I'm not going to accept an offer that's even worse than the one I made in the first round. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer.

  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best deal, but I'm willing to compromise!""
