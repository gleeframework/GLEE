Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  We both get a decent amount, and it's better than the 5% loss from inflation each round. Let's work together! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still hoping for a better deal.  While 4500 is decent, I think I can do better with a little more negotiation."
