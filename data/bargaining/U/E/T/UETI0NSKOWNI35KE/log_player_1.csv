"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This is a fair starting point, as I am offering him a small portion to consider accepting. Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to have more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. With inflation, my gain is worth less in each round, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future. Accepting 500,000 dollars is a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
