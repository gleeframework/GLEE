"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
This way, I'll get 60% of the initial 100$, which is $60, and Bob will get 40% of the initial 100$, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, and I want to maximize my gain, I'll make a more aggressive offer. Here it is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
