Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite unfair. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 65/35 split.  This is a chance for you to secure a decent sum before inflation eats away at your potential earnings. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
