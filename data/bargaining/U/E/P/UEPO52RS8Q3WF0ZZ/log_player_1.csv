Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more to avoid further rounds, but I need a better share to compensate for my own inflation disadvantage.  Let's split it 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
