Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a small portion, hoping he'll accept and we can end this quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this is a much worse deal than my initial offer, I'm accepting. Due to inflation, my potential gains in the next round are significantly lower, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything at all. It's better to secure a small amount now than risk getting nothing."
