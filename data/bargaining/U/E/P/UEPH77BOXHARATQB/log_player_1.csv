Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money in a 70:30 ratio. This seems fair considering we're dividing it right away.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to take a slightly smaller share this round, but I think a 60/40 split is a better starting point. Let's try to work something out! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
