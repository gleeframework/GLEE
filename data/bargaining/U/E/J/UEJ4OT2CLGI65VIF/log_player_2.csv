"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want the majority. Accept this and we'll both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer might seem generous at first, it's important to remember the inflation factor. Even though I'm only getting 100,000 now, it's likely to be worth significantly less in the next round.  I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I'm offering you a decent share, but we both need to be reasonable to avoid losing money to inflation. Accept this and we can both walk away with a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's avoid further losses and accept this offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hit hard.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and further rounds could see the value of my share decrease even further."
