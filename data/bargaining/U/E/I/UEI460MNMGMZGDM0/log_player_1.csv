"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a good deal for me 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than that, and I'm not willing to accept a 1/3 share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money by 10% again, so I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 375000,
  ""bob_gain"": 625000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to protect my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still getting a good deal 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I still think I can do better than a 1/4 share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4 and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money. In round 5, the money I gain will be worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and 10% less than in round 3.

Here's my offer for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 275000,
  ""bob_gain"": 725000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not getting left with nothing""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but I'm also trying to protect my own interests in this round."
