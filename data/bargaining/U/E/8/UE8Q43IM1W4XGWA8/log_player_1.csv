Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going for a greedy strategy to start. I want to maximize my share, knowing the money will lose value for me in the next round.  I'll take almost everything and give Bob just $1 to hopefully convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While Bob is being incredibly generous, I'm still in a better position than him. I know the money will lose 20% of its value if I reject, but I'm betting I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still going for a larger share, but I need to be a little more reasonable this time. I'm offering Bob 100,000, knowing that the value of my share is now lower than it was in the first round. Hopefully, this is enough to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the best offer I'm likely to get. My share will be worth much less in the next round, and I'm not sure I can convince Bob to give me more. While I'm disappointed to be getting only 100,000, it's better than nothing."
