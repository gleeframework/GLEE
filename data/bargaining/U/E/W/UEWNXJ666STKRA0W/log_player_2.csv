It's always better to see if I can get more!  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 5100 
# Alice gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is fair, and considering the inflation, it's likely she won't offer more in the next round.  Let's take it."
