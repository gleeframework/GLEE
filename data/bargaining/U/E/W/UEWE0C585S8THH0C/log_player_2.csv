"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The current offer gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I think I can negotiate for more. Plus, the inflation rate is higher for me, so I'd like to try to get a better deal before the money loses too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a more even split. Considering the inflation rate is higher for me, I think this is a fair offer.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting you harder, Bob.  I need a better deal than that to accept. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n### {""decision"": ""reject""}
I'll reject this offer as well. The inflation is indeed hitting me harder, but Alice's offer is even less favorable to me than the first one. I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a better offer, considering the significant difference in the proposed split. I'll try to negotiate for a more balanced deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This offer is closer to the middle, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is a strong offer, but fair given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}
I'll reject this offer again. Although the pressure of time is increasing, Alice's offer still doesn't seem fair to me. The difference in the proposed split is significant, and I'm not convinced that this is the best deal I can get. Considering the inflation, I'll try to negotiate for a more favorable offer in the next round, even though the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""We're running out of time, and the inflation is taking a toll. I'm willing to split the money evenly, considering the circumstances. This is a fair deal for both of us, and I think we should take it before the money loses even more value.""}"
