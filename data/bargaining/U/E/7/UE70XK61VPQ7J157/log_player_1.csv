"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to respond and make his own proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than 50/50. How about 60/40 in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than before, so I'd be getting $400,000, which is $60,000 less than I would have gotten in the first round. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with giving Bob a 60/40 split, especially since I don't know how inflation is affecting him.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to maintain a bit of leverage. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to accept this offer and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but I think 65/35 is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'd be getting $350,000. That's a significant drop from what I'd get in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a 65/35 split, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'm not sure if I can afford to wait for a better offer.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will stick to his word and we can move on to the next round.
