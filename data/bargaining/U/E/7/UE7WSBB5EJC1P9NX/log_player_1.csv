"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the lower amount for now.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly higher share this round, but we can still work towards a more even split in the future.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $45 is worth 95% of $60, and Bob's gain of $55 is worth 90% of $40. This means that Bob is offering a slightly higher share, but still more than he initially proposed.

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90.25% of $60 (95% of 95% of $60), and I'll aim to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try for a more even split now.""
}
```"
