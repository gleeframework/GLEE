"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, the effective amounts are:

* Alice gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000
* Bob gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
