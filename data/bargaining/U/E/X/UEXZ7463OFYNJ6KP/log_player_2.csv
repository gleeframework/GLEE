"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this is a reasonable split to get the ball rolling. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was kind, but not beneficial for me. I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's try to be more equitable this round.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was tempting, but the devaluation hurts me more than you. I need a slightly better share to make this work.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is acknowledging the impact of devaluation, her offer is still worse than her initial offer in real terms. I need to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a continually shrinking share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the devaluation is a concern. This offer is a compromise - closer to your offer, but still recognizing my need for a reasonable share.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm moving closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Firmness:** However, I'm not accepting an offer worse than my previous one in real terms.  
* **Urgency:**  Rounds are progressing, and the devaluation is hurting both of us. I need to push for a resolution before the money shrinks significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to settle this soon.  I'm feeling the pressure from the devaluation. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging both our needs. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the devaluation is rapidly eroding the value of the money.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a slightly better offer in future rounds isn't worth the risk of walking away with nothing.  
* **Alice's Position:**  Her message suggests a greater willingness to compromise due to the time pressure. 

While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable payout considering the circumstances. The longer we wait, the less we both gain."
