"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a warning, but also an invitation to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the risk of inflation, I propose a more equitable distribution. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better deal elsewhere, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in taking a smaller cut now rather than risking a worse deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe we can find a middle ground that considers both our needs. 
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns. Given the inflation and the fact that my offer from Round 3 was rejected, I'll consider Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $750,000 is a decent share, and I'm not confident I can do better in the next round."
