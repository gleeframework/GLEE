"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal."

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the fairness of your initial offer, but I believe 60/40 is a more equitable split, given the inflation rates we're facing. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm losing value faster. This offer considers the long game. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting worse for her with each round, while my losses are still relatively small. I'll continue to see if I can secure a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but I need to secure a larger share to offset the inflation.  This offer reflects a fair balance given the current circumstances. Let's make a deal.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is going nowhere. We're both losing out with this stalemate. Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is significantly impacting Alice, and the risk of losing out completely outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal. A 50/50 split is the most logical way to end this game."
