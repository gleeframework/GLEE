Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a larger share than your last offer. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean Bob loses a significant amount of value due to inflation.  He needs to hold out for a better deal, knowing that Alice is also feeling the pressure of the diminishing pot."
