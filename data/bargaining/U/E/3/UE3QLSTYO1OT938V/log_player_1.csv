  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}

# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for himself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a 60% share, especially with the money being worth less and less with each round. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round!"

```
{
