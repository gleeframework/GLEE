75.0,25.0,I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1. This ensures we both get a fair share considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's fair considering the inflation and I'm willing to share more than 50% in the next round.,Bob,2,
