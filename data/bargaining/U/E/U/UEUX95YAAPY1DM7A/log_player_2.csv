"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2500. I believe this is fair given the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While $2500 is something, it's a very small portion of the total money. It's worth risking a round to see if I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split. This is a fair deal, as the value of the money is declining for me with each round. This offer gives you a significant share, and allows me to secure a decent amount before further devaluation.""
