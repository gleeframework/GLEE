I'm taking a smaller share this time, but still aiming for a good chunk of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that the inflation is working against him and he might accept a deal that's less favorable than his previous offer."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a substantial portion of the money. The inflation is hurting me, but I'm hoping Bob will start to see that it's in his best interest to reach an agreement before we both lose out completely."
