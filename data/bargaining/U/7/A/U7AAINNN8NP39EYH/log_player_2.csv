"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, but the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. It's worth seeing what kind of offer I can get if I'm the one proposing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you want to be fair Alice, but the inflation dynamics put me at a disadvantage in later rounds. This offer accounts for that disparity."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer still gives you a good deal considering the inflation, and it's closer to a fair split. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to anchor me to her idea of a ""fair split,"" but she's still not fully accounting for how much the inflation benefits me. I need to signal I'm willing to play this out longer if necessary."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be reasonable, but this needs to be a win-win. I'm open to finding a compromise, but lowballing me won't work.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out because of the inflation. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, which means my position is strong. She's trying to frame a 50/50 split as ""fair"" due to the inflation, but she's forgetting that *her* losses are much greater than mine.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, a 50/50 split might sound fair in a vacuum, but the clock is ticking *against you* more than me. Let's be realistic and find a compromise that benefits us both."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  You are severely underestimating the impact of inflation on my returns. This is a compromise, take it before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. While this isn't my ideal outcome, the inflation is eating away at her share significantly faster than mine. If I push further, I risk getting nothing. It's time to take this decent offer and end the game."
