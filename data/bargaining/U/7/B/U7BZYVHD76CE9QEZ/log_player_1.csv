"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and take $6000 for myself, with the message ""Let's split fairly"". This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable and fair offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. Since there's no inflation affecting Bob, he might be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risking getting less in future rounds. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation that will apply to you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the inflation has reduced the value of the money for me, accepting $4500 now would mean I'm getting less than what I initially offered Bob in the first round. Considering the game has just started, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round, hoping to get a better deal despite the increasing inflation. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4750 and take $5250 for myself, with the message ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle"". Given the impact of inflation on my potential gains, I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob. Since he didn't accept my initial offer and I rejected his counteroffer, it's time to try and find a compromise. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and we can conclude the game."
