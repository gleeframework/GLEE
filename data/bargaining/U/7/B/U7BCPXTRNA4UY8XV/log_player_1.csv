"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think 60:40 is a fair split considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
