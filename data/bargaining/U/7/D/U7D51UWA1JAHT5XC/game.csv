7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal than this. Let's split 70/30 in my favor. This is the last offer I'll make with such a significant share.  After this, I'll be more cautious about losing more value with each passing round.",Alice,3,

4000.0,6000.0,"I'm willing to move closer to your proposal, but 60/40 is the most I can offer. This way we both get a fair share, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds.",Bob,4,
