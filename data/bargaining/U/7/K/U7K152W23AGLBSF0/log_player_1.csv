"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the initial $10,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $3,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $2,700.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept it.
