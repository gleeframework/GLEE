"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively high offer for myself, but leaving a significant portion for Bob to encourage him to accept in the first round.  I'm hoping this will avoid potential issues with inflation and give us both a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is much lower than my initial proposal, it's still a significant sum and given the inflation, it's likely the best outcome I can achieve in this scenario.  Accepting ensures I receive something, whereas rejecting could lead to further losses due to inflation and the potential for Bob to propose even less in the future."
