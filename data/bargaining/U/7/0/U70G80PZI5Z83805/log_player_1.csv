Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 85 for myself and 15 for Bob.  This is still a good deal for me, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to accept considering his previous offer was rejected.  I'm also trying to avoid going too low too quickly, as this could lead to a situation where we both end up with nothing."

Bob's offer is getting more and more lopsided.  I am still in a strong position to negotiate since the inflation rate is only impacting him. I'll reject his offer and continue trying to secure a better deal for myself."
