"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to make the game worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to be more equal, I see!

I'll think about it for a moment...

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with less money due to inflation."
