"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  I figure it's unlikely Bob will accept this, but it sets the stage for future negotiation.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the end.  Let's split it evenly!"
