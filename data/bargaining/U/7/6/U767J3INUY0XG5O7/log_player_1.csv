"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, we can reassess later""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair and simple offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share to account for potential future inflation, but still leaving you with a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a bigger share, but I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept his offer for now.
