Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you want a bit more, but your previous offer felt too unbalanced. How about we meet in the middle? I propose $55 for me and $45 for you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation impact on my end, I think this split is more reasonable now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, this offer is back to his advantage (and our disadvantage) compared to the initial round. We're still within the first half of the rounds, so we have leverage to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against you, but I'm willing to make this simple.  A 50/50 split is fair and avoids us dragging this out further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point of the rounds.  It's time to make it clear we're serious about a fair deal.
* **Inflation Factor:**  By now, Bob should be feeling the pressure of the decreasing value on his end. Highlighting this fact reinforces our position.
* **Clean Split:** A 50/50 offer is the most straightforward and removes any perception of us trying to take advantage. It's easy for Bob to accept without feeling like he's losing out."
