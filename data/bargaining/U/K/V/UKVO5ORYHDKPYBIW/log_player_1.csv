"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take 90$ and give 10$ to Bob.  I want to be greedy in the first round, hoping Bob will accept, but I will adjust my offer if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  Although I'm losing money due to inflation, I don't think I should accept a 10/90 split when in the previous round I offered a 90/10 split. I'll try to negotiate a more equitable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'll lower my offer to 70/30, still hoping for a better split. I'll try to be more reasonable this time, but I'm not willing to accept a 10/90 split when I'm losing money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still reject this offer. While inflation is hitting me hard, I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, especially after I offered a 70/30 split in the previous round.  I'll try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. Inflation is really hurting my gains at this point, but I believe this is the fairest offer.  I hope Bob will accept and we can both get something out of this."
