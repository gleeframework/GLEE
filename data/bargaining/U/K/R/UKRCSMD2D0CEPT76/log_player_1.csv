"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. My message is a friendly but assertive opening move, suggesting that I'm willing to be generous, but also confident in my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I've been a bit shortchanged so far. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $8,000 gain in the first round is now worth $7,200, and Bob's $2,000 gain is now worth $1,900.

Considering Bob's offer, I think he's trying to make up for the initial rejection, but I'm not sure if it's enough. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my $7,200 gain is now worth $6,480, and Bob's $1,900 gain is now worth $1,805.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial proposal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, but still trying to get a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. I think we can find a fair split, but you need to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll! Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my $6,480 gain is now worth $4,701, and Bob's $1,805 gain is now worth $1,548.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think he's trying to get closer to a fair split, but I'm not sure if I want to give him the majority. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my $4,701 gain is now worth $3,391.13, and Bob's $1,548 gain is now worth $1,325.29.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I think I can do better than that.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, but I'm not convinced that's the best deal for me. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate further."
