"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 80% and you get 20%.""
}
```

This offer is a generous one, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm not giving up yet! I'll take the majority this time. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, the money I gain is still worth $800,000, but Bob's gain is worth $855,000 (900,000 * 0.95). This is a tough one, but I'll have to reject this offer.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! I'll give you a bit more this time, but don't get too comfortable.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than my first one, but still leaves me with a decent amount of money. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"

# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is really pushing his luck now! With inflation, the money I gain is still worth $800,000, but Bob's gain is worth $901,750 (950,000 * 0.94875). This is getting ridiculous! I'll have to reject this offer.
