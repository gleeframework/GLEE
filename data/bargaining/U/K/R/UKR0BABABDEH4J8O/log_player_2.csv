**Reasoning:**

While Alice is finally budging a bit, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapidly devaluing money.  We're past the halfway point, and she's feeling the pressure more than I am.  Holding out a bit longer might force her hand, allowing for a more even split."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The money is losing value fast.  Let's be logical and split this evenly.  It's the fairest option and ensures we both walk away with something.""}"
