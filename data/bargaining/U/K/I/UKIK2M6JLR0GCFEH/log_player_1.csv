"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting you more each round.  I'll take 65/35 to end this now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd rather take a smaller share now than lose even more to inflation. This is my compromise. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is willing to compromise.  While his offer is getting closer to more reasonable, I think I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking. I'll take 70/30. It's my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm pushing Bob a little further, hoping that the increasing inflation will make him more willing to accept a less favorable deal to avoid walking away with nothing.  The ""final offer"" approach adds pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, and I'm losing value fast. Let's split it down the middle and be done with it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is significantly hurting Bob now.  While I was aiming for a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this point guarantees a decent outcome for me before the remaining rounds potentially result in no deal at all."
