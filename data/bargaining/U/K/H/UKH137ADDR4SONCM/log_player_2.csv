Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 52.5/47.5 split. This is closer to your last offer, and it still gives us both a decent amount. Let's get this done before the inflation eats away more of our money. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
