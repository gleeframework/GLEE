"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money, and I'll take the remaining 80%. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 70 is now worth 56% of the original amount, which is less than the 80 I could have gotten in the first round. Bob's gain of 30 is worth 21% of the original amount, which is less than the 20 he could have gotten in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or reject it. I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a bit more, but I need to think about my own share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 44% of the money, which is 8% more than his previous offer, but still keeping my share at 56%. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than this. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 60 is now worth 40.8% of the original amount, which is a bit more than the 56 I could have gotten in the previous round. Bob's gain of 40 is worth 25.2% of the original amount, which is a bit more than the 30 he could have gotten in the second round.

I'm starting to feel a bit more optimistic about this offer. I think I should accept it, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money.
