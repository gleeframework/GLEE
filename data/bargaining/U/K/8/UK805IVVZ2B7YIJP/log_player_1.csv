Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing a lot of value here. Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day. This is a fair deal considering we're running out of rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The inflation is severe and escalating. Waiting any longer significantly diminishes the value of the money for both of us.
* **Bob's Position Weakening:**  While Bob is experiencing higher inflation, making him theoretically more desperate, he's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this at this stage. He knows time is running out.
* **Risk of Losing Everything:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds is too risky.  We could both end up with nothing."
