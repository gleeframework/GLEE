Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a good starting point, as it's a significant advantage for me but still leaves Bob with something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, this offer is better for me than waiting another round.  I'm getting 1000, which is worth less than I offered Bob, but still something, and waiting another round risks a further drop in the value of my share."
