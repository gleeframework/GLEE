"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting, and my gains are worth 20% less than before. I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not meeting you in the middle, Bob! I want more!""
}
```

I'm hoping to squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money by another 20%, so my gains are worth 40% of what they were in the first round. I'll have to be more aggressive to make up for it.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob! I'm taking what I can get!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time to be fair, Alice. 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really biting! My gains are worth a mere 51.2% of what they were in the first round. I'm not sure if I should take the 50/50 split, but it's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing everything.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I'm hoping it's the best I can get at this point."
