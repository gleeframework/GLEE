"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping to get a quick agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair deal, indeed!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer. Let's split it evenly and call it a day!"
