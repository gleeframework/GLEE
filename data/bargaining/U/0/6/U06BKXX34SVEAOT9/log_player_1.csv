"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the new amounts are:

Alice's gain: $7,000 (10% less than $8,000)
Bob's gain: $2,000 (no change)

Bob's offer is:

Alice gain: $5,000
Bob gain: $5,000

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, $5,000 is equivalent to $5,500 in the first round, which is a better offer for me than the $7,000 I would have gotten in this round.

I accept Bob's offer.
