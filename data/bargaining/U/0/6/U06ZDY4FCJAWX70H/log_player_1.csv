"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more equitable. It gives us both a good chunk of the money, and it feels like a more fair compromise than your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
