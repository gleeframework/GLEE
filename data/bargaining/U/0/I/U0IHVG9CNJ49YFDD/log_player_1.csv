Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me 90% and Bob 10% of the money. This is a good starting point because it allows me to get a significant portion of the money and gives Bob something to consider.  Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer in round 2 is the best move. The inflation means my share will continue to decrease with each round, and Bob is likely to continue to demand an equal share. By accepting now, I secure at least half of the money, which is better than risking getting nothing later."
