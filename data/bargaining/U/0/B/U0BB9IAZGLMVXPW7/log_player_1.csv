Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, considering he's taking the majority.

```

}
```

I'm rejecting the offer, hoping that I can get a better deal in the next round."
