"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'll start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This gives Bob a small incentive to accept, but still leaves me with a large majority of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, and since I know inflation only affects my gains, I'm better off rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a significant portion of the money. I believe this is a reasonable offer given the inflation that has occurred and the fact that I'll be making the proposal.  Hopefully, Bob will accept to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation has reduced my gains significantly, Bob's offer is still very unfavorable. I will reject it and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

Given the significant inflation and the fact that Bob seems unwilling to compromise, I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equal division, and I believe it's the best I can do at this point."
