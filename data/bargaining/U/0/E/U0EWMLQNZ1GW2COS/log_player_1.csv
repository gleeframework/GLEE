"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split, but slightly biased towards me. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 30-70, a compromise to get closer to the middle 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less, so the actual amount I'll get is 70 * 0.95 = 66.5.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Will you accept a 55-45 split, a compromise to get closer to the middle?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 25, you can have the rest, it's getting tough to make ends meet with inflation 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

Since my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the actual amount I'll get is 75 * 0.8554 = 64.045.

I'm not sure if I want to give up that much, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values...
