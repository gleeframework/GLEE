"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new proposal. Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $45 is actually worth 80% of the original $50 I could have gotten in Round 1, so it's a bit of a loss for me. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $55 is worth 90% of the original $50, so it's a bit more favorable for him.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreased value. Since the money is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%), I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values I'd get from Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $52 is worth 52 / 1.488 = 35.04% of the original $50 I could have gotten in Round 1, which is a significant reduction. However, Bob's gain of $48 is worth 48 / 1.271 = 37.73% of the original $50, which is also a reduction, but less severe than mine.

Given the relatively smaller reduction in Bob's gain, I'll decide to accept this offer.
