"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any potential conflict or negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower share, but it's still a good starting point. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'm not as eager to accept a lower share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob to make another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's see if this works for you.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly higher share and keeping a decent amount for myself."
