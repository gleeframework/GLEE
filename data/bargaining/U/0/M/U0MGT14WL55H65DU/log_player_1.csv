"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering you 10% of the initial amount, which is $10, and I'll take the remaining 90%, which is $90. I'm hoping you'll accept this fair share and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 10% less for me, so the actual amount I'd gain from Bob's offer is:

$50 * 0.9 = $45

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split to move forward. I'll accept Bob's offer.
