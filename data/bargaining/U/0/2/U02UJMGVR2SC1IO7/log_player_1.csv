"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, giving Bob 40% of the total amount. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is losing value, and Bob is trying to take advantage of that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at the value of the money! Bob's offer is getting more and more skewed towards his favor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. I'm not going to settle for such a small share, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a fair share""
}
```

I'm trying to find a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair compromise given the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
