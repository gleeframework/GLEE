"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair deal?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly offer, suggesting that this is a fair and reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but still fair and reasonable 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money is worth less due to inflation, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll think for a moment... 

I don't think this offer is very generous, considering the original amount was $1,000,000. I'd like a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70-30, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is a bit more balanced.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle at 55-45, a fair compromise?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite! With the money worth 14.26% less than the original $1,000,000, I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Bob's offer is a 45-55 split, which is not significantly different from my previous offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if this is the best I can get.

I'll think for a moment... 

Actually, I think I'll accept this offer. It's not a great deal, but it's better than nothing, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob.
