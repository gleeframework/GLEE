I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. I'm starting with a generous offer to see if we can reach a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a fair split, but with each round passing, the value of the money decreases.  I'm willing to concede a little to reach an agreement."
