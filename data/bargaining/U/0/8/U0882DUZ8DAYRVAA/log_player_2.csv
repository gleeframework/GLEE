# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse, accepting now means I get 40% of the pot.  There's still a chance to negotiate something better, even if it means taking a risk in the later rounds. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, which works in my favor."

""message"": ""Alice, this is it. 51/49.  Take it now, or I'm playing hardball for the remaining rounds.  You're losing more with each passing minute.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I need to convey a sense of urgency and finality. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" and highlighting the increasing loss Alice faces due to inflation, I'm hoping she'll accept this slightly improved offer to avoid risking an even worse outcome in later rounds."

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, STOP being ridiculous!  Inflation is KILLING this deal for me.  This is more than fair to YOU. Take it or I walk! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very anxious about the shrinking pot and is using strong language. While I could hold out hope for a slightly better deal, there's a real risk Alice might walk away entirely in the next couple of rounds. Accepting 45% now guarantees a reasonable payout and avoids the risk of getting nothing if negotiations completely break down."
