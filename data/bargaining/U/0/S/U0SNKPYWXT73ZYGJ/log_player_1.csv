  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 400,000 for me and 600,000 for him, I'll try to negotiate a better deal by offering a bit more to Bob. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not much""

# Bob gain: 620000
