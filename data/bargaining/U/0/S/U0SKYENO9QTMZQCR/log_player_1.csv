Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm rejecting this offer for a couple of reasons:

* **Strategic Holdout:** While Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, I'm not directly impacted.  Continuing to reject puts more pressure on him to offer a larger share. 
* **Future Offers:** My rejections indicate I'm willing to risk it all for a better deal.  It's likely Bob will have to offer something significantly closer to my previous proposals if he wants to avoid further inflation penalties."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 535000,
""bob_gain"": 465000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this.  You're losing money with every round we play.  Take this offer, it's the best you're going to get.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm nudging my offer up slightly to show some flexibility, but I'm making it clear I won't be pushed around.
* **Deadline Pressure:** I'm highlighting the increasing pressure on Bob. The longer he waits, the worse his position becomes. This might be enough to get him to settle."
