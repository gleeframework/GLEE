Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** Inflation is significantly eroding the value of the money, especially for Alice. Every round that passes makes the potential gains smaller for both of us.
* **Downward Trend:**  Alice's offers have been getting progressively better for Bob.  Her initial offer was heavily in her favor. Now, she's offering a split that's closer to even.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks Alice proposing an even worse deal in the next round, where the inflation impact will be even harsher. 

Accepting the $550,000 now secures a reasonable sum, even if it's less than initially hoped for.  Continuing to play is a gamble with increasingly worse odds."
