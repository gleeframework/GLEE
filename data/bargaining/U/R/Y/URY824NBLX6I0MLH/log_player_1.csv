"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now to make up for the loss in value. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiation. However, Bob's offer is still relatively close to the initial 50-50 split. I'll decide to accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
