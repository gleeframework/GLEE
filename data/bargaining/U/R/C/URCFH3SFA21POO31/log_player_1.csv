"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself as I'm the first to make an offer. This gives Bob a decent starting point, but it's still in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. Since Bob rejected my previous offer and we are now facing inflation, it's in my best interest to offer a more equitable split. This gives me a good chance of getting a fair share of the money before further inflation devalues it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the money is worth 27.1% less for me, Bob's offer is still higher than the 50/50 split I offered in the previous round.  It's better to take something than risk further inflation and get nothing."
