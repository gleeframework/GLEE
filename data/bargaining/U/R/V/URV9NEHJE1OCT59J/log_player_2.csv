"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a proposal that might be more in my favor. The 60/40 split seems a bit too skewed towards Alice, and I think I can do better, especially considering the inflation factor. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more balance, considering inflation hits me harder.""}\n\nSince I'm more affected by inflation, I'll try to negotiate a slightly better split for myself while still being somewhat fair. Hopefully, Alice will see the reasoning behind my proposal and accept it. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're feeling the inflation more, but a 50/50 split seems fair, considering I'm also losing value. Let's try to be reasonable here. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Given the impact of inflation on both of us, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise at this point. Continuing to negotiate might lead to further devaluation of the money, potentially resulting in a worse outcome for me. It's time to secure what I can.\n\n### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's finalize the agreement and split the money 50/50."
