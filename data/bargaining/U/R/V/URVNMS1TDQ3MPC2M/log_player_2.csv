"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A little extra for me to start things off. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% decrease in value isn't too significant yet, and I think I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take the bigger share this time, but still a relatively fair split.""}\n\nSince the money is now worth 5% less, the actual value of the $10,000 is $9,500. I'm hoping Alice will consider this offer before the value decreases further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. Another round and we both lose more. A 50/50 split is the only logical choice. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept the offer. With the money's value decreasing by 9.75% from the initial amount, it's indeed logical to split it evenly and minimize further losses.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
