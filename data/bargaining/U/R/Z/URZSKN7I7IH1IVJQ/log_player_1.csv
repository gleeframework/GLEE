"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided offer from Bob. I'd rather not accept it. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm trying to balance the scales a bit more in my favor, but still offering a decent compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
