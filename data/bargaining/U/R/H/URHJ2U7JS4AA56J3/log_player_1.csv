"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 10% share, and I'll take the remaining 90%. I'm starting with a fair proposal, and we can adjust from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm thinking 90/10.  It's fair given the inflation factor for you. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take the lion's share, doesn't he?

Considering the inflation factor, I'm not thrilled about this offer. I'd rather wait for a better proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit one-sided, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal this time. Considering the 5% inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the inflation hit""
}
```"
