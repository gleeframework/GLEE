"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to raise my offer to 80/20.  Bob is obviously aiming for a very lopsided split, so I'm willing to concede a bit, but not much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm sticking to my principles. Bob is being greedy, and I'm not going to accept anything less than a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to split the money evenly.  It's the fairest solution, and if Bob rejects it, we'll be stuck in an endless loop of proposals."
