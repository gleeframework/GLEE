"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This way, I'll get 42% of the remaining value of the $1,000,000, and Bob will get 58%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I think this is a reasonable offer, and I'd rather accept it than risk waiting for another round with even lower values."
