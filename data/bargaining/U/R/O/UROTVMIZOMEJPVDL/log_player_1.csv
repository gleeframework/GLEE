Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation!""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I take $60 and Bob takes $40, considering the impact of inflation on our gains. I've included a message to Bob to justify my proposal and encourage him to accept. Let me know his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share loses value faster. This is a better deal for you than it seems. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his claim that it's a better deal for me due to the faster devaluation of my share, I believe I can negotiate a more favorable split in the next round. Let's proceed and see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this offer, I'm proposing that I take $58 and Bob takes $42, considering the impact of inflation on our gains. I've included a message to Bob to justify my proposal and encourage him to accept. Let me know his response!

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, despite the initial goal of getting more than half, the significant devaluation of my share due to inflation (48.8% less than in the first round) makes a 50/50 split a reasonable and fair deal at this point. Continuing to negotiate risks further devaluation, potentially leading to a worse outcome. Let's conclude the game with this offer!
