"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4000 I would gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to $4000 / 0.9 = $4444.44.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split, but it's a better offer than the 50/50 I initially proposed. I'll decide to...

Round 3

```
{

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 65% is a fair share for me 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (1 - 0.271 = 0.729). So, the $3500 I would gain is worth $3500 / 0.729 = $4805.61.

I'm not comfortable with the 65/35 split, but I'll consider it. However, I think I can do better than that. I'll decide to...
