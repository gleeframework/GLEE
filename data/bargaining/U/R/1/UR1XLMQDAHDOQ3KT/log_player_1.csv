Round 4

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice given the circumstances and projected trajectory of the game. Here's why:

* **Increasing Losses:**  With each round, the inflation eats further into Alice's potential gains. Rejecting this offer means risking even greater losses in the next round. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is unlikely to offer a significantly better deal in future rounds. He's aware of the inflation working against Alice and is using it to his advantage. Holding out for a marginally better offer in Round 5 or beyond isn't worth the risk of getting even less.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees Alice $4,300. Rejecting this offer means gambling on Bob's generosity and the hope that he'll offer a better split in the next round, which is not guaranteed. 

**In essence, while not a perfect outcome, accepting a less favorable offer now mitigates potential losses due to the game's mechanics.**"
