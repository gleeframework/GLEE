"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money 7000 for me and 3000 for you. This seems fair given the inflation might affect the value of money in the future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 50/50, considering we're starting with a large sum and can afford to take a smaller cut. Plus, it's a fair and simple way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
