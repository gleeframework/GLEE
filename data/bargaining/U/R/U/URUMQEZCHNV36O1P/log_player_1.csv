"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and propose a very uneven split. Since the money loses value faster for Bob, I'm hoping he'll accept a smaller share now rather than risk getting even less later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like to get more, the money is losing value rapidly, and Bob's offer is still significantly better than what I'd get if we go another round. I'll take the 300,000 and avoid the risk of getting even less."
