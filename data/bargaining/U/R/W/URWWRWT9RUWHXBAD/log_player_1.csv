"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. While this might seem unfair, consider the inflation that will hit your share in the next round if you reject this. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
