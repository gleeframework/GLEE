"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. I want to maximize my share while still leaving Bob something to consider.  It's risky, but hopefully, he'll accept to avoid the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though the inflation penalty is less for me than Bob, I'm still losing a lot of money. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money, but I've adjusted my offer slightly to be more reasonable. Hopefully, this time Bob will see the value in settling before further inflation eats away at our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. While inflation has impacted my potential earnings significantly, I'm still confident that I can do better in the next round. Bob's offer is too low for me to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to secure a majority share. The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm hoping that Bob will realize that if he continues to reject offers, he could end up with less than he has now."
