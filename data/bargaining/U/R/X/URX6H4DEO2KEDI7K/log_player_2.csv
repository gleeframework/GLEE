"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's play it smart! I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 20% inflation rate is quite high, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a better deal. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and minimize our losses due to inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making a counteroffer that is more in my favor, but still reasonable considering the inflation rate. I'm hoping Alice will see the sense in meeting in the middle and accept this offer before the money loses even more value. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm giving you one more chance to make a good deal. The clock is ticking, and our potential gains are shrinking! 
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the money is losing value rapidly, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice seems willing to make concessions, so I'll try to push my luck a bit further. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Time is running out! Let's split the difference and make the most of what's left.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making another offer that takes into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'm hoping Alice will see the urgency of the situation and accept this proposal. Meeting in the middle should be more appealing now that our potential gains are shrinking fast. Fingers crossed!"
