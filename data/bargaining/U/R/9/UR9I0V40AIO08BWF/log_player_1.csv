"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it, as he's getting something rather than nothing.  If he rejects, I'll try to be a bit more fair in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer.  It's better than getting nothing if we keep playing.  I'll accept."
