"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  We both get a good share this way! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $500,000 (down from $600,000)
* Bob's gain: $400,000 (down from $500,000)

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a 50-50 split, and it's a fair deal considering the decreased value of the money.
