60.0,40.0,"I propose we split 60/40. I understand this isn't perfectly even, but time is valuable, and any further delay will only lessen the overall pot for us both due to inflation.",Alice,1,

42.0,58.0,"Given the impact of inflation on your end, I think a 58/42 split is more than fair, considering the value of the money decreases more significantly for you with each passing round.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need a larger share to compensate for the time value lost due to inflation. Let's settle on 55/45.  This gets us both a reasonable amount while avoiding further losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
39.0,61.0,"Considering the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I believe a 61/39 split is reasonable. Each round further diminishes the value of the money for you, making it urgent to conclude the deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, this is reaching a critical point.  I'm willing to compromise further, but 52/48 is the absolute lowest I can go.  Another round and the inflation will eat significantly into the value, hurting us both.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"Given the substantial decrease in value for your share due to inflation, a 65/35 split seems increasingly fair. It's crucial to finalize the deal now to avoid further devaluation of your portion.",Bob,6,
