Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this. I'm willing to be more flexible, but I still need a decent chunk of the money. Let's see if we can end this already. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal than 40% of the total amount. Considering the inflation, the current offer is actually less valuable than it would have been in the first round. I'll take my chances in the next round.\n###\n\nNow it's my turn! Here's my proposal for Round 4:\n\n# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and consider the inflation. We both lose if we keep going.\n# Bob gain: 475000\n# Alice gain: 525000\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice."
