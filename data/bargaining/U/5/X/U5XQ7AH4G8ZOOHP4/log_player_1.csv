"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we split the money fairly and compromise on the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $6,000 in Round 1 is now equivalent to $4,800 in Round 2.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not too thrilled about the 75-25 split. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 20% inflation from Round 2, my gain of $4,800 is now equivalent to $3,840 in Round 3.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer, but still a compromise. My message is an invitation to find a middle ground and work towards a fair division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle, but I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% inflation from Round 3, my gain of $3,840 is now equivalent to $2,000 in Round 4.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm intrigued by the 50-50 split. It's a fair and equal division, and I think it's a good opportunity to end the game.
