"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me $900,000 and Bob $100,000. I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's end the game now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth $427,500 in real terms.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""This is a more balanced offer. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not too much.""
}
```"
