"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: 45 * 0.95 (due to 5% inflation) = 42.75
Bob gain: 55 * 0.95 (due to 5% inflation) = 52.25

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as my initial offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate for the inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```

I'm offering Bob 35% of the current value of the money, which is $35, and I'll take the remaining 65%, which is $65."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 14.26% inflation:

Alice gain: 50 * 0.855 (due to 14.26% inflation) = 42.75
Bob gain: 50 * 0.855 (due to 14.26% inflation) = 42.75

It seems Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair proposal. I'll accept this offer.
