{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start fair.  I propose we split the money 60/40, with me taking the larger share. This gives you a good starting point, and we can adjust in later rounds if you prefer.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's go with 55/45, I'll take the slightly larger share this time.  We can work towards a better compromise in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
