"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it was a good starting point, but I think I can do better than 1:4 ratio. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and 3:2 is still not good enough for me. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a fair split. Let's meet exactly in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob has finally made a reasonable offer! Meeting in the middle at 50/50 seems like a fair and reasonable split, especially considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
