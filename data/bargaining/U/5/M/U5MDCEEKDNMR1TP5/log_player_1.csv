**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting dire. While ideally, I'd like a larger share, Bob is clearly exploiting the inflation and my dwindling time.  Here's why accepting is the best (though unpleasant) option:

* **Time Pressure:** We're at round 8, leaving only 4 rounds. If I reject, there's a high chance we won't reach an agreement and both get nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I manage to make an offer in round 12, the inflation will have eroded its value significantly. $3800 now is better than potentially even less then.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:**  Bob's messages indicate he's unlikely to budge much. He's betting on my desperation.

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting this offer ensures I at least walk away with something rather than risking a complete loss."
