"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less now, I need to be careful. Bob is offering me $400,000, which is now worth $320,000 in real terms. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. I'll try to propose a slightly smaller share for Bob this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share this round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share this round. I'm willing to compromise, but not too much. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value fast! With the money being worth 48.8% less now, my share of $350,000 is actually worth only $180,800 in real terms. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a bit lower than my previous proposal.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and having even less value for my share. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
