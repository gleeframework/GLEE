"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards his favor, but it's a better deal than my initial offer. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
