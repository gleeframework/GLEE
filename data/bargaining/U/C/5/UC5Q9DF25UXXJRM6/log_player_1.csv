"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try to get a better deal for me! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob rejected my first offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd rather aim for a higher amount. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a bit too even for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to get as much as possible now, since the money will be worth even less in the next rounds.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better deal here, take it or leave it!""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly better share, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard!

Considering the drastic decrease in the value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions. Bob's offer is a 45-55 split, which is closer to the 50-50 split he proposed earlier. However, I still want to try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be even more careful with my offer. I'll try to get a better deal, but not too greedy, since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

This offer is a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get impatient, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the drastic decrease in the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is not in my favor, but I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to negotiate in future rounds.
