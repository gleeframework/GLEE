,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Time is running out, and the value decreases with each round. This is a good deal for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,"That's a tough one, Bob.  While I understand the time pressure, your offer doesn't feel quite balanced to me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but let's see what the next round brings.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll agree to a 55/45 split, but in my favor this time. It considers the time pressure but is still fair to both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we're getting close. I understand your position, but 55/45 in your favor is too steep.  Let's settle on 52/48 - a small concession on my part, but it gets us both what we want.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. However, that offer still heavily favors you, especially considering the time pressure is affecting my potential gains more than yours. Let's try for a more balanced agreement.",Alice,4,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. I'm willing to go slightly below my last offer to 51/49. This acknowledges the time factor while still striving for a more equitable split. What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4950.0,5050.0,"Alice, this is the most reasonable deal we'll get at this point. 50/50 is ideal, but I'm taking a tiny hit at 50.5/49.5 to finalize this.  Let's close the deal and avoid losing everything.",Bob,6,
,,"Okay, Bob, you drive a hard bargain. Let's finish this. I accept the 50.5/49.5 split.",Alice,6,accept
