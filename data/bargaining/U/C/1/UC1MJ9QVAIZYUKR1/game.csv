4000.0,6000.0,"I think we can both do better. Let's split the money 60/40 in my favor this time. It's a fair deal, considering we both lose money each round we don't agree.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair given the decreasing value. I'm proposing a compromise at 55/45. We both lose significantly if we keep playing this game.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice,  I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 55% of the money and you can have 45%. This is a fair offer given the current value of the money, and it's better than both of us getting nothing if we keep playing.",Bob,4,
