"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get a decent amount, but still leave some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the 50$ I would gain is now worth less than the 40$ I would have gained in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

Considering the offer, I think 45$ is a reasonable amount for me, given the current value of the money. I'll accept Bob's offer.
