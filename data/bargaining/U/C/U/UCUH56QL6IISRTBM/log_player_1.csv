Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split. We can adjust later if needed, but let's work together to ensure we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
