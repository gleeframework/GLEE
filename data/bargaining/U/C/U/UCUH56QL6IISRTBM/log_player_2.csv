"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to split it more evenly in future rounds if you accept this. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer is too lopsided, and while she's promising a more even split in the future, there's no guarantee she'll follow through. I'll reject this and see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
