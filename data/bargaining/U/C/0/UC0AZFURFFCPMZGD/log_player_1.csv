"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm confident I can convince Bob to accept in the early rounds. This ensures a good starting point with minimal risk of losing everything to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is the safest option at this point. Inflation is a real threat, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
