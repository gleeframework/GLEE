I propose a 9000/1000 split, in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will find this fair, but I'm also aware of the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500} 
```

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, with me taking 8500 and Bob taking 1500.  Since inflation has kicked in, I need to be more aggressive to ensure I get a decent share."
