"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This is a relatively generous offer, considering the current state of the game. I'm offering Bob a small portion of the money, but I'm also keeping a significant amount for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% decrease in value, the money is worth less than before.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.
