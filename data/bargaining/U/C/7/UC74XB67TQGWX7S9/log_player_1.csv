"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 2000 is actually worth 1600 in real terms, and Bob's gain of 8000 is worth 7200.

I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I suppose it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
