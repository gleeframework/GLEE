"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $10,000 with a 70/30 split in favor of you, Bob. This should give us both a fair share while considering the potential impact of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 75/25 split in my favor is a more equitable way to handle the inflation risk. It gives you a comfortable share while still leaving me with a good amount to work with. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
