"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Fair and reasonable split, let's end the game!""
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable,  I'll take a slight majority, but you still get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, I do want to maximize my gain.

I'm not thrilled about Bob getting a 55-45 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.
