"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair to me. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation. Let's make a deal!""}\n\n###\nI've taken into account the inflation and made an offer that I believe is more balanced. I'm willing to take a bit more than half, considering that the money is worth less with each passing round. Let's see if Alice accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. My previous offer was already generous. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not convinced by Alice's ""final offer"". Considering the inflation, her offer is actually less valuable to me than it seems. I'll take my chances and make another proposal in the next round. Maybe I can still get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm taking into account the increasing inflation and the fact that Alice's previous offer was not very generous. This is my counteroffer. Let's see if she's willing to compromise!""}\n\n###\nConsidering the inflation, I've decided to increase my share slightly, while still leaving a reasonable amount for Alice. I'm hoping she'll realize that it's better to accept this offer rather than risking another round with even more inflation. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. We've both lost some due to inflation, but this is the most reasonable offer you'll get. Let's end this before we lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. While I was hoping for a better deal, the current proposal is relatively fair, and further rounds would only lead to more losses for both of us. It's time to cut our losses and take the deal!"
