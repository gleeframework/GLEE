"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. It's a fair starting point, considering the money decreases in value faster for you.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I understand the time pressure, but your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 70/30 split.  This reflects the risk I'm taking with each passing round.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further. A 60/40 split seems fair considering the time pressure and the inflation affecting you more.  Let's find a solution before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still heavily favoring her. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a more equitable split. Accepting a 40% share at this stage would set a bad precedent for future negotiations."
