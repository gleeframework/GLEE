I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I'm making the first offer, I'm aiming for a significant advantage, but I'm not being completely greedy. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, Bob's offer is worse than my original proposal. I'm willing to risk another round, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share of the money, but I've adjusted my offer slightly to account for the inflation and Bob's rejection of my previous offer. I believe this is a reasonable proposal that offers a better outcome for both of us. Let's see if Bob will accept this time."
