"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and we can still have a decent chance to negotiate further if we want to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Since the money is worth 20% less now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $200,000 / 0.8 = $250,000
* Bob gain: $800,000 / 0.8 = $1,000,000

I'm not happy with this offer. I'd like to get a better deal. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you $450,000 and keep $550,000. Let's settle this!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal than the previous offer, but still be reasonable and give Bob a decent amount."
