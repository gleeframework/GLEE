"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good foundation""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a good foundation to work from."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly better deal while you still can! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can do better than this. I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Compromise on a slightly more equal split""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining $4,000. I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but I'm still holding onto a slight advantage."
