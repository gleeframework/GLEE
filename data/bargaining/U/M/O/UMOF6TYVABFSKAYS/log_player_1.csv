I propose a 900,000$ for me and 100,000$ for Bob.  This is a very generous offer, considering the fact that Bob only loses 5% of his money each round, while I lose 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
