"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:2 in favor of Alice, given the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the risk of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I propose a 5500/4500 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the risk of inflation, and it gives us both a good share of the money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation risk, I propose an equal division of the money to minimize the potential loss for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. Given the inflation risk, an equal split is a fair compromise and ensures we both get something."
