"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation will impact you more heavily than me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The offer is not good enough for me, considering the impact of inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
