"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual values as follows:

My gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the initial amount. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800, and I'll take $4,200."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain: 4500 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = 6,191.19
Bob's gain: 5500 / 0.855 (1 - 0.145) = 6417.65

I'll accept this offer.
