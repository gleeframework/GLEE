"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a small piece to show I'm not greedy. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Even though I get a small piece now, it will be worth much less in the future. I need to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share and we don't have to worry about the inflation eating away at our gains.""}
