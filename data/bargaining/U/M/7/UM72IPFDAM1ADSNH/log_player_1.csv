"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my 40$ gain is actually worth 32$ (80% of 40$). Bob's 60$ gain is still worth 60$. I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'd rather not accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not going any lower""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go any higher 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my 35$ gain is actually worth 17.8$ (48.8% of 35.8$, but since the 100$ is now worth less, the actual value is less). Bob's 65$ gain is still worth 65$. I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the value of the money has decreased significantly.

```

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.
