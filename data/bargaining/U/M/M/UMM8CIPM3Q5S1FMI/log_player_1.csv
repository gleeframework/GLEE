"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  Since I'm starting, I'm being generous to Bob, knowing the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is not ideal, I'm accepting because:

* **Inflation:**  The money is already worth less than in round 1. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 12 rounds, the risk of getting nothing is high if I continue to reject offers. 
* **Future Offers:** It's unclear how Bob will factor inflation in future rounds, and my share could potentially decrease further. 

It's better to secure a smaller share now than risk getting nothing later."
