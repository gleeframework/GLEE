"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation we both face.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, even after accounting for inflation. I'll reject it and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'll offer a 85/15 split. While inflation has reduced the value of our gains, I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the changing circumstances. Let's see if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse for me, even after factoring in inflation. I'll continue to reject his offers and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split. I'm willing to concede a bit to reach an agreement, but I believe this is a fair deal considering the ongoing inflation and Bob's consistently worsening offers."
