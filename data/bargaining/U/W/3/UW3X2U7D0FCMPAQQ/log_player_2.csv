"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I'd like to see if I can get a better deal. It's only Round 1, and I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value due to inflation in the hopes of getting more than half of the money. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since I'm taking the risk of inflation.""}\n\n### I'm trying to negotiate for a bit more, while still being somewhat reasonable. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I don't think you should take advantage of the inflation too much. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### Although Alice is offering a bit more, I still think I can negotiate for an even better deal. The inflation isn't too severe yet, so I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round. Maybe I can get closer to 60% or more!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bigger risk due to inflation, so I'll take a bit more. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}\n\n### I'm trying to push my luck a bit further, while still being somewhat reasonable. Since the inflation is starting to take its toll, I want to try to get as much as I can before the money becomes too devalued. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't give you everything. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 54 
# Alice gain: 46 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### At this point, the inflation is starting to take a significant toll on the value of the money I gain. Alice's offer of 54 is still a relatively good deal, considering the decreasing value of the money. I don't think I can negotiate for a much better deal, and I risk losing even more value if I reject this offer. So, I'll accept this compromise and end the game here."
