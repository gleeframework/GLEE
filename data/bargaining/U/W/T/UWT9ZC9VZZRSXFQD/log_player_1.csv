"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm the first one to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll get $90 instead of $80.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'd rather aim for a higher amount. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
