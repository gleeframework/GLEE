"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! 60/40 split seems reasonable. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer wasn't fair to me. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Inflation is hurting Alice more than Bob. Each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for her, making her more likely to accept a less favorable offer in later rounds.
* **Strong Stance:** By using a firm ""take it or leave it"" tone, Bob asserts dominance and might push Alice to accept to avoid further losses from inflation.
* **Future Considerations:** While this offer is still slightly in Bob's favor, it's a significant shift from Alice's initial offer. If Alice rejects this, Bob can make a smaller concession in the next round, knowing the pressure is on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here.  50/50 is a fair split after our previous disagreements.  It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Deal:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair. 
* **Inflation Impact:** While Bob had an advantageous position in Round 2, the impact of inflation is becoming significant. Accepting a fair deal now guarantees a decent amount, rather than risking further devaluation of the money in future rounds.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice moving to a 50/50 split suggests she is unlikely to accept an offer heavily skewed in Bob's favor. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a worse outcome for Bob as the money loses value."
