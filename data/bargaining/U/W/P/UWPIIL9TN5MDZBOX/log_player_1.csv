"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000."

Round 2

Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful, since the inflation is affecting Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the value of the money in real terms.
