"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, and with inflation working against us, I want to secure a significant portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his initial proposal, it's still not in my best interest. The inflation rate means I'm losing a significant amount of value each round. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm proposing a 7500/2500 split.  I'm increasing my share a bit from the first round, but still offering a decent amount to Bob.  Given the inflation, I need to secure a larger portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round.  While his offer is higher than his previous proposal, it's still not worth accepting given the significant inflation rate.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 6000/4000 split.  While the inflation is hurting, I'm still trying to secure a larger portion of the money.  This is a fair offer given the circumstances.  Hopefully, Bob will accept it to avoid further inflation."
