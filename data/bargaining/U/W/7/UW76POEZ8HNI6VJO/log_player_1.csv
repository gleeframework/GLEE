"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and accept the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 5% less, so $8,000 is now equivalent to $7,600.

Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, which would give me $5,000 and Bob $5,000.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can do, but it's a fair split. I'll accept the offer.
