"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough decision! Let's analyze:

**Bob's Offer (Round 2, after inflation):**

* **My Gain:** $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000
* **Bob's Gain:** $600,000 * 0.9 = $540,000

**If I Reject:**

* I'm banking on getting a better offer in the next round when I propose.
* However, the money will be worth less due to inflation.

**Considerations:**

* Bob's offer isn't terrible. It's more than I'd get if I simply split the money 50/50 in this round.
* As rounds progress, the inflation will make even seemingly ""good"" offers less appealing. 

**Decision:** While I'm hoping for a better deal, the risk of waiting is getting higher with each round.
