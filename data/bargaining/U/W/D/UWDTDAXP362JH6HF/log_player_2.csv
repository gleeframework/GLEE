"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts pressure on me, but your offer was too low. This is a more balanced proposal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on you, I think this is a reasonable adjustment 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. The value will be significantly diminished for both of us if we continue.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said the value will be significantly diminished, but it only affects you. I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the value of waiting any further is heavily skewed against Bob. While getting only $3000 is a significant loss compared to the initial rounds, waiting will only result in an even smaller amount. Accepting Alice's offer, while not ideal, cuts his losses."
