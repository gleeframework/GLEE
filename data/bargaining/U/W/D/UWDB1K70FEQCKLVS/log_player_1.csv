"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fair split, but I'm not getting less than 50%! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain would be 48 (60% of 80, since 100 * 0.8 = 80), which is less than Bob's offer of 50.

I accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
