"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money 4:1 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 4:1 is too extreme. I'll give you 3:2, which is still a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
