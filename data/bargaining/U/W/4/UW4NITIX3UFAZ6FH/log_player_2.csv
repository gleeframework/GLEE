{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""I think a 51/49 split is a more fair starting point. It takes into account the inflation that will affect your side more. Let's start from here and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your attempt to factor in the inflation. However, the initial split needs to be more balanced. I propose a 52/48 split. This recognizes the time pressure while still offering you a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
