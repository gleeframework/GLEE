I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal! Even though 40 dollars is a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get more.  Let's see what happens in the next round."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a better deal. While Alice is offering a slightly larger share, I'm not convinced it's worth it yet. I want to see if I can get a more even split."

# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  While Alice is offering slightly more than last round, it's still not fair. I want to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split.  Inflation is a big factor, so I'm pushing for a deal that will at least minimize my losses."

Round 6

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""We're getting close to the end.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than 50%, but I need to get something closer to that to make it worthwhile.""}

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to pressure me by mentioning time, but I'm not giving in.  While the offer is slightly better than before, it's still not fair. I'm going to push for a better deal in the next round.  I'm aware that time is running out, but I'm still hopeful I can get a more equitable split."

I'm accepting this offer. Inflation is hitting hard, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's not ideal, but at least I'm getting something."
