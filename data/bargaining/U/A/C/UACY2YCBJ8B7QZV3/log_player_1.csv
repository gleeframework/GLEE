"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm starting with a generous offer, knowing that the money will be worth less to him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer more, it's better to secure a fair share than risk getting nothing in the next round with the continuing inflation."
