Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still biased towards her, but I'll consider it. The inflation factor is affecting her more significantly, so I'll think about it...

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Since Alice's offer was 3:1, I'll try to counter with a 1:3 ratio, but with a twist to account for the inflation.
