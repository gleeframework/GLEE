Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try and secure the majority of the money in the first round. This is a risky strategy, as Bob might reject my offer and I'll lose 10% of my potential gains in the next round. However, I think it's worth the risk to see if I can get a favorable outcome early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, accepting this offer is the best course of action. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My potential gains have decreased by 10%, making it harder to secure a significantly better deal in the future.
* **Risk:** There's no guarantee I can secure a better offer in the next round. Bob might offer me even less, or I might have to propose a division that's even less favorable to me.
* **Fairness:** This offer is reasonably fair, giving me 60% of the remaining money. It's not an ideal outcome, but it's a good compromise.

By accepting, I secure a decent amount of money and avoid the risk of getting a worse deal in the future."
