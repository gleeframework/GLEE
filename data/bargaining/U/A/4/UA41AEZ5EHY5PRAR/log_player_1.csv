"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. No need for haggling.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with taking only 40% of the remaining amount, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to let you take everything. Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive this time, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'll take a bigger share, but I'm still willing to give you something. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a small share, even if the money is worth less. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. It's getting harder to make ends meet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, Bob. I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to give up entirely. This is my last offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money and the fact that I'm running out of leverage. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see reason."
