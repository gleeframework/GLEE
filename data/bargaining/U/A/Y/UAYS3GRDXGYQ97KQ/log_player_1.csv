"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! Don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to split it evenly. That's a reasonable proposal. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll get $500,000 and Bob will get $500,000."
