"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting we split it evenly to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still worth 100% and the money Bob gains worth 90% (due to the 10% inflation), I'm not convinced that 40 is a fair share for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the current state of the game, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that the money is worth less for Bob now.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is repeating his previous offer. However, considering the effects of inflation, I'll take a closer look.

Since the money I gain is still worth 100% and the money Bob gains is worth 72.9% (100% - 27.1% inflation), I'm not convinced that 45 is a fair share for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the continued effects of inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more this time""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not getting nothing 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is willing to give me a larger share, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Considering the effects of inflation, the money Bob gains is worth 59.05% (100% - 40.95% inflation), which is a significant reduction. I'm not sure if 30 is a fair share for him, but I'm willing to consider it.
