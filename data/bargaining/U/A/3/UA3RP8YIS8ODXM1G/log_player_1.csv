I'm going to try to maximize my gains in the first round, hoping Bob will accept.  Since I'm the one proposing, I'll take a large chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can do better than this.  If I reject, the money will be worth less to me in the next round, and Bob will still be able to offer me less.  It's time to take the deal."
