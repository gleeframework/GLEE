Let's see what Alice offers next."

I'm offering Alice a smaller share, but I'm still giving her a significant portion.  I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, as we both get something rather than risk losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is better than the last round.  Although it's not as good as my initial offer, the inflation is a real concern, and it's better to get something than risk getting nothing."
