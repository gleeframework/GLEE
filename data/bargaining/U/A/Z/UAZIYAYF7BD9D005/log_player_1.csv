"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, as I rejected your offer last round. Let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, I'll consider the effective value of the money I'll receive.

The effective value of $40 after the first round is 80% of the original value, so in the second round, it's worth 80% of 80% = 64% of the original value.

However, Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, which means I'll receive $60, but its value is still 100% of the original value.

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about whether I want to accept this offer. Since I'll receive a smaller share in terms of effective value, I'll...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, and I want to be more aggressive in my offer, I'll make a slightly more favorable offer for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the initial $100, which is $45, and I'll take the remaining $55."
