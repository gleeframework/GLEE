"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount to start with, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a fair split, I think I can do better. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still the smart one!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, hoping to take advantage of the inflation and Bob's relatively smaller offer last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting too greedy, I'm the smart one now! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although I was hoping to get more, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I don't want to risk losing out on any amount. This way, I'll get $4,000, which is still better than nothing."
