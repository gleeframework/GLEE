"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively even split considering the initial amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the new values, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $285,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is now worth $560,000.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since I was hoping for a more even split. I'd like to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more reasonable split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a relatively even split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the initial offer was quite generous. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money continues to decrease!

Let's calculate the actual values:

* My gain of $400,000 is worth $342,800 (14.26% less than the original $400,000, but considering the previous rounds, it's actually worth $283,200)
* Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth $312,000 (48.8% less than the original $600,000, but considering the previous rounds, it's actually worth $336,000)

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since I was hoping for a more even split. Considering the decreasing value of money, I think I can do better. I'd like to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor, but still a relatively even split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
