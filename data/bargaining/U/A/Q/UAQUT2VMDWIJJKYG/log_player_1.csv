Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Accept this and we both avoid further losses from inflation.

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical decision. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** Bob's share is already worth 14.26% less than at the start. This impact will only worsen with each round.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in Round 5 is risky.  There's no guarantee Bob will offer more favorable terms, and we risk getting even less if the game continues. 
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split, while not maximizing my potential gain, is a fair outcome given the circumstances."
