"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground, I'll give you a fair share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,000 in the first round. Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $3,800 in the first round.

Considering the offer, I think it's a good compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
