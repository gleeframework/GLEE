"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering to take $55 and give Bob $45. My reasoning is that since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to get a bit more upfront to account for the potential loss in value. Meanwhile, Bob's money is worth 20% less with each round, so he might be more inclined to accept a slightly lower offer to avoid further devaluation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's speed things up. 60/40? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of 60/40. While the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm not willing to give up that much to Bob, especially since his share is worth significantly less due to the higher inflation rate affecting him. I'll make a new proposal in the next round to try and find a better balance. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering to take $52 and give Bob $48. Given that we both have to deal with inflation, but Bob's is significantly higher, I'm trying to find a middle ground that acknowledges both our losses. My previous offer was rejected, and Bob's counteroffer was too skewed in his favor. This proposal aims to balance our interests, taking into account the devaluation of the money for both of us. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
