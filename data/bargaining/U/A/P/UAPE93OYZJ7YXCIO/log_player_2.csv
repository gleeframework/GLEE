Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough spot.  While I'd prefer a more equitable split, here's why I'm accepting:

* **Severe Inflation:** The 46.86% inflation means I'm losing a huge chunk of potential earnings with every round that passes.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice consistently rejects offers where I get more than 50%, indicating she likely won't budge further.
* **Something is Better than Nothing:** If I reject this offer and we go another round, the deal will likely be even worse for me, and I risk ending up with nothing. 

It's frustrating, but accepting minimizes my losses at this stage."
