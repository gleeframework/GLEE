"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair and reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is still $100, but the value of the money has decreased due to inflation. If we split it down the middle, I would get $50, which is 50% of the total amount.

I accept Bob's offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
