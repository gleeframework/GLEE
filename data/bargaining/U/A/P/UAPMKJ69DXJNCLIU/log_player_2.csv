"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Let's be efficient and take this deal, Bob. With each round, we stand to lose a significant chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's logic of taking the deal to minimize loss is valid, I believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We're both losing money with every round. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's still a win for you, and it avoids further losses due to inflation.  Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I acknowledge the risk of further inflation, I'm still not convinced that this is the best deal. I'll continue to push for a more favorable split."

Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5200
