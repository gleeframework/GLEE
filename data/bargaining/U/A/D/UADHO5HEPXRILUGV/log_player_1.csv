"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We both get a good amount, and we don't have to risk losing money in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
