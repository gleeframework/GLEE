"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""I understand you want an even split, but the value decreases for me over time. This is the same offer as Round 1.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's important to reiterate the impact of inflation to Bob. By offering the same amount as Round 1, I'm highlighting that this is a consistent and fair deal considering the declining value of the money for me. Bob needs to understand that a 50/50 split in later rounds will disadvantage me significantly due to the inflation mechanic."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, how about a slight advantage for you, considering the time pressure? 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer shows he's finally acknowledging the time pressure, the proposed gain for me is still significantly impacted by inflation. Accepting this offer would mean I'm losing almost $200 compared to my initial offer, which is a considerable amount. I need to hold out for a better offer that truly reflects the decreasing value of the money on my side."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Time is running out! I'm willing to compromise, but the split needs to account for the inflation. This offer is less than my first, but more than yours.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my asking amount to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and reach an agreement. 
* **Urgency:** Emphasize that time is a factor, and waiting benefits neither of us.
* **Framing:** By pointing out that my offer is a compromise from my original ask but still more than his offer, I'm hoping to nudge him towards a deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle this. This is a fair offer acknowledging the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 5050 
# Bob gain: 4950 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is now barely above the 50/50 split. Considering the significant impact of inflation with each passing round, accepting this offer minimizes potential losses. Holding out further might force me to accept an even worse deal as we approach the final rounds."
