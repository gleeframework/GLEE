"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

This is a fair starting offer considering the inflation rates are much higher for Bob than for you.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair, considering his inflation rate is much higher than mine. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. Let's see if this offer is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the high inflation rates, Bob's offer is more advantageous for me than the risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds. I'll accept it and move on."
