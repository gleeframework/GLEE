"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and equal division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $400,000 is worth $360,000 in the current round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 60/40 split, as it's not as favorable to me as the 50/50 split I proposed initially. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with further inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
