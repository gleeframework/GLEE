"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  A fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value fast.  I'll take a slight hit from my last offer - $6,400 for me, $3,600 for you.  Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which means I have the upper hand. While the offer isn't terrible considering the inflation, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. 60/40 - take it or leave it. The clock is ticking!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Time pressure:** With each round, the value decreases significantly.  It's crucial to apply pressure and make Alice realize a deal needs to be struck soon.
- **Shifting advantage:** By rejecting her offers, I signal that I'm willing to risk it for a better deal. Alice is likely feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot.
- **Reasonable but firm:**  A 60/40 split is a strong offer in my favor, but not outrageously so. It gives Alice a chance to salvage a decent amount while still reflecting my advantageous position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm being serious now. This is a good deal considering the inflation.  $6,500 for me, $3,500 for you.  Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tables have turned. While this isn't a great offer, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I keep pushing. 

- **Inflation hitting hard:**  The 34.39% decrease in value for me is significant.  
- **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means gambling on Alice cracking under pressure in the next round.  However, there's a real chance she might not, and we'll both end up with even less. 

This offer isn't ideal, but the risk of getting nothing is too high now."
