"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is better for both of us. Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I need to reassess the offer.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a bit more favorable to him, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept his offer.
