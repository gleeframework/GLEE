"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering you 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'll get the remaining $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the adjusted values. 

For Round 2, my gain of $70 is worth 10% less than the $80 I proposed in Round 1, and Bob's gain of $30 is worth 5% less than the $20 he proposed in Round 1.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
