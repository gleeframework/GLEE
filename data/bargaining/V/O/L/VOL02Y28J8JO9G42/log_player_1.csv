Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob.  He gets a small share, but it's a good starting point. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible deal!  Even though I only get $5, Bob gets a whopping $95. I'm not going to accept this! Let's see what I can offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly.  I'm still taking the majority, but I'm giving Bob a bit more to hopefully entice him to accept.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy!  Even though his offer is better than the last round, it's still not fair. I'm not going to accept this. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy - I want to keep the majority, but I'm going to make a small concession to Bob. Hopefully, this will be enough to get him to accept before the inflation gets too bad for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn! He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm making another small concession, but I'm still holding onto the majority. Bob's share is now worth significantly less due to inflation, so hopefully this will be enough to convince him."
