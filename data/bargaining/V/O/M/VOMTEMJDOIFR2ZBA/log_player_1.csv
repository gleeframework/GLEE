Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, as I want to see how Bob responds.  I'll make adjustments based on his reaction in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and while I'm not thrilled with only getting 50%, it's better than the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds.  I'm assuming Bob is being rational and doesn't want to risk getting a worse deal in future rounds."
