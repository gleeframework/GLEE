"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a relatively high offer, so I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we can avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not considering the inflation effect on my gain. However, I know that Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

Splitting the money evenly means that Bob is getting a smaller share than he would have gotten in the first round. Considering the inflation effect, this offer is actually a good deal for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
