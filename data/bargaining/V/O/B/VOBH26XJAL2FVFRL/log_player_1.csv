This is a tough situation. While it's frustrating that Bob is taking advantage of the situation, I'm quickly running out of options. 

If I reject this offer, the value for me will decrease even further in the next round, and Bob knows this. He's likely to offer me even less then, making my position worse. It's better to take the current offer than risk getting a much worse deal in Round 7."
