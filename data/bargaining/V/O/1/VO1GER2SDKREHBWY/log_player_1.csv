"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount to make it worth his while to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 4000 / 0.95 = 4210.53
Bob gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
