"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm taking almost all the money, leaving Bob with a small amount. Since the money is worth less each round for Bob, he'll be more likely to accept a small amount now to avoid the further devaluation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is not ideal, accepting it ensures I still get some money. With the inflation, rejecting and proposing again would significantly reduce the value of my potential gain.  It's better to take the smaller amount now than risk getting nothing in the future."
