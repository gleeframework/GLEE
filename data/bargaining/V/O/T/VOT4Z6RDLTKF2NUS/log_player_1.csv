"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the offer.  I figure this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will impact Bob more severely in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something, the inflation will hit me harder in the long run. I'm willing to gamble on getting a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. While I'm still aiming for a majority, this is a more balanced proposal that acknowledges the growing impact of inflation. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'm disappointed that I'm getting less than I initially hoped, I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is hurting me more than Bob, and accepting this deal prevents us both from losing more money in future rounds."
