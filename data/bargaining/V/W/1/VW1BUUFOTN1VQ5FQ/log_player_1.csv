"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a majority share""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to weigh my options carefully. Since Bob is offering a 60% share, which is more than my previous offer, I'll consider it a decent compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take 40% of the remaining $100. It's not the maximum I could have gotten, but it's a reasonable compromise, and I'd rather end the game here than risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds."
