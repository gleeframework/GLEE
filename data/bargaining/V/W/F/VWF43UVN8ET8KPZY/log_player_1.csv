"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward offer."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still keeping the majority 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Given Bob's offer, I'm getting 300,000, which is 30% of the original amount, but it's worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the majority of the money.

I'll reject this offer for now.
