Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the early rounds.  This way, I maximize my potential gains, even with the inflation risk.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation! I won't accept this offer. I'll counter with my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to accept before the inflation hits us both too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation, but his offer is becoming more reasonable. However, I'm not ready to accept this yet. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, hoping to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 6000, hoping to find a middle ground. The inflation is starting to impact my gains significantly, so I need to accept a deal soon. However, I'm still aiming for a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but I still think I can do better.  I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is really hitting hard now, so I'm offering an even split.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept before the value of the money drops even further.  It's a risky move, but I need to secure something before it's too late."
