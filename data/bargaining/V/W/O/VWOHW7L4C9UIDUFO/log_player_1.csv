Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand that a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface. However, I proposed a reasonable division in the first round, considering the impact of inflation on my share. I'm willing to negotiate further, but your offer doesn't reflect the changing value of the money for me.""
