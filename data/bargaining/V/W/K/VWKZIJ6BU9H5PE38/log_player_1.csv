"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is designed to be very favorable to me (Alice) but still offers Bob a tiny amount, hoping he might accept it rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer is the best option for me. Inflation will make the money worth less in the future, and there's no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything in the next round. It's better to take the 600,000 now."
