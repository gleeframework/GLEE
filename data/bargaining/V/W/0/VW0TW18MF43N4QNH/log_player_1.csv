"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This gives Bob a small share, but it ensures a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is tempting, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change in favor of Bob. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
``` 

I'm offering a 81/19 split in my favor.  This still provides a significant gain for me, while also making a concession to Bob. I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate fairly while still safeguarding my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is more appealing than the last one, it still feels too lopsided in Bob's favor. I'm willing to compromise, but not to the point of accepting a 20/80 split. I will counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm offering an 72.9/27.1 split in my favor. This represents another concession on my part, and I believe it offers a fair compromise that allows for continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still consider this offer too heavily weighted in Bob's favor. While the inflation is a factor, I am not willing to accept such a significant loss just yet. I'll counter with a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439}
```

I'm offering a 65.61/34.39 split in my favor.  This reflects the decreasing value of my share due to inflation, but I am still offering a reasonable compromise. I believe this is a fair offer that allows for further negotiation while ensuring I am not significantly disadvantaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still find this offer too far from a 50/50 split, even with the inflation taken into account. I'll counter with a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904.9, ""bob_gain"": 4095.1}
```

I am offering a 59.05/40.95 split in my favor. This reflects the significant inflation I've experienced, but I'm still making a concession by offering more than a 50/50 split. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to move closer to an agreement."
