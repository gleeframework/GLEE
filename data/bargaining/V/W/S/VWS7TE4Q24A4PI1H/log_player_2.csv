Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 50%. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's not ideal, I'm going to accept this offer.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
