"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point.  Let's see if we can agree on this.   
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll receive $3600 (80% of $4500) if I accept this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 55/45 split. I think I deserve a bit more, considering the initial offer I made.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation again, the total amount is now worth 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 50%. Your turn!""
}
```"
