Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting slightly better, Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. Accepting now would still mean I lose a significant chunk of the potential value. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  We're running out of time.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is rapidly eroding my potential gains. I need to signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal, and that continuing to push for a larger share will only hurt both of us in the long run. This offer is still advantageous to her, but leaves me with something worthwhile."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time's running out, my patience is wearing thin 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is killing me. At this point, taking Alice's offer, while far from ideal, is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
