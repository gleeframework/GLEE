"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even though the offer is incredibly lopsided, it's worth taking a chance and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate.  It's highly unlikely Alice will keep proposing such a lopsided offer, knowing that the money will be worth less to Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's split this fairly. I'm willing to give you a generous share, but I need a substantial portion to make it worthwhile.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 90/10 this time.  It's a fair deal for both of us, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
The money I'm gaining is worth significantly less due to inflation, making this offer more appealing than the previous ones.  It's a reasonable compromise, and accepting it is the best way to ensure I get some money."
