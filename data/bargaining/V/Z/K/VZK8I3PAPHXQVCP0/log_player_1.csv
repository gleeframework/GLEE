"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to accept a smaller share this time. Here's my response:

```
