"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and call it a day!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a little more since I'm taking the risk of rejection.  Let's split it 60/40 this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, as I think it's unfair to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 55% is a fair split. Let's meet in the middle.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still a reasonable compromise."
