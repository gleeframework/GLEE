"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, so I'm offering a compromise. This is a better deal for me than waiting.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Both our potential gains are decreasing each round. It's in my best interest to settle sooner rather than later.
* **Fairness with Urgency:** While Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor, I'm offering a more balanced split that still acknowledges her desire for a larger share.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By making a reasonable offer in round 2, I put the pressure on Alice. If she rejects, she risks getting even less in future rounds as the value decreases."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** The effects of inflation are starting to become significant. Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller gain for both of us.
* **Acceptable Offer:** While not ideal, Alice's offer is now much closer to a 50/50 split. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even after inflation.
* **Risk Assessment:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in the next round. She might become even more demanding, putting me in a worse position."
