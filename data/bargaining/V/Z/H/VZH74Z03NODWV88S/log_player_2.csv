Let's see what kind of offer I can get!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to start with a more even split. Since I get to make the offer this round, I'll take a slightly larger share, but still leave a decent amount for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it would be nice to get more, the inflation is starting to take its toll.  An even split is fair, and with the money losing value each round, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers."
