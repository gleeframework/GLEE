"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a generous offer considering the inflation. Let's wrap this up quickly.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for my turn to make a proposal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation rate, I think 55/45 is a fair split. The longer we delay, the less the money is worth.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm offering you 4900. This is more than you would have gotten last round considering the inflation.  I won't go lower. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and Alice's message, I think this is a reasonable offer, and further rounds will only decrease the value of the money."
