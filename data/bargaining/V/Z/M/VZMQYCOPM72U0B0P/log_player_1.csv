"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! 

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of 40 is actually worth less than my initial gain of 60. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

But, I'll have to make a decision... 

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time for me to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher gain to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}"
