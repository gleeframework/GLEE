"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,

}

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100, and Bob will get the remaining 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll accept it.
