"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get the majority""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a generous offer, but it's actually a pretty standard split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we'll both face.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I'd better get a better deal. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my original proposal, but I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to counter with an even better offer. I'll propose a 50-50 split, which is a fairer split considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```"
