"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't do better than this, can you? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my effective gain is now 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since it's a bit better than my initial offer, I'll think about it... but I'm not ready to accept yet.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
