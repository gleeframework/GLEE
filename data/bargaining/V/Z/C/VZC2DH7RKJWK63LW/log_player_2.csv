Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""My turn. This factors in inflation's impact on my share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split now 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a good deal considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to make one more deal 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, at this point the inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. Accepting Alice's offer, while not as good as my previous offer, still nets me more than I would likely get in another round.
