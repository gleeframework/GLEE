"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, which is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a 50/50 split. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so my gain would be 720,000 (80% of 900,000).

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but it's a reasonable offer. I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
