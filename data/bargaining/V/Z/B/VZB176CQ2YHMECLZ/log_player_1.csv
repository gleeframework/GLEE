Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fair initial offer, as it splits the money evenly. Since we're playing a game of negotiation, I want to see how Bob responds before making any more aggressive moves."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is quite aggressive, taking a large chunk of the money for himself. Since my money is unaffected by inflation, I'm not in a rush to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to reflect Bob's inflation penalty. I'm hoping this is a more appealing offer for Bob while still leaving a decent portion of the money for myself."
