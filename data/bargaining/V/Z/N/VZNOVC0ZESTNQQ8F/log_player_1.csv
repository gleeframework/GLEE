This is a tough one! Here's why I'm making this decision:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The inflation is severe. Waiting any longer means a significantly smaller amount for me, even if I get a slightly better deal in later rounds.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems unwilling to budge much. It's unlikely he'll suddenly offer me a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds.
* **Something is Better than Nothing:** Getting $40 now is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds.

It's a gamble, but the risk of getting nothing is too high to continue refusing."
