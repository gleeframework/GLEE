I'm going to try to get the most money for myself, but I'm also trying to be fair. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept that. It's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly, but I still think this is a reasonable compromise. Hopefully, Bob sees it that way!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more unreasonable.  I'm not going to accept that offer.  It's my turn to make a proposal again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest way to divide the money, and hopefully, Bob will realize that we're just wasting time if we keep going."
