Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more even split of 55/45. This seems fairer, and with inflation, we can both still walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
