"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I rejected your offer because it wasn't fair given the inflation. I'm proposing 55/45, which is a good compromise.  It benefits you to take this deal now, before inflation eats away more of your share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
