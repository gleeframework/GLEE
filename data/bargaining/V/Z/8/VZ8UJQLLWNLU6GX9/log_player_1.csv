"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it more evenly. I'll take 55, you take 45.  This way we both get a fair share and avoid too much loss from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
