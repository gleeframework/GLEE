"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm framing this as a fair split to see if Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my gain accordingly. In this round, my gain of $5,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, but Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better. I want to negotiate further to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain of $5,000 is worth 81% of what it was in the first round, due to the cumulative 10% inflation. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise.""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $6,000 in Round 3 is worth 0.729 (1 - 0.271) = 72.9% of what it was in the first round, but in Round 4, it's worth 0.729 * 0.907 (1 - 0.093) = 0.661 = 66.1% of what it was in the first round.

Bob's gain of $5,000 in Round 2 is worth 0.95 = 95% of what it was in the first round, but in Round 4, it's worth 0.95 * 0.858 (1 - 0.1426) = 0.814 = 81.4% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the actual values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can still get a better deal. I want to negotiate further to get a higher share."
