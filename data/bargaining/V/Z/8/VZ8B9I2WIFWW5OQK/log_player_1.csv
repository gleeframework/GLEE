"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk rejecting it and ending up with nothing.

I'll accept this offer.
