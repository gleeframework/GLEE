"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split,  let's start with this and see if we can agree. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such an uneven starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. Let's be more reasonable. This offer is fairer and will save us both time and money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. This is the fairest way to divide the money and avoids further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I would have preferred a slightly better split in earlier rounds, accepting a 50/50 split now makes the most sense. Further delay due to rejection will only erode the value of the money for both of us."
