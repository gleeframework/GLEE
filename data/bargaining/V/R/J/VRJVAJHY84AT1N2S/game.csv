60.0,40.0,Let's split the money. I take 60 and you take 40. It's a good deal for you in the first round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Let's split fairly, considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,I understand the inflation concern. How about we reverse the previous offer? It seems fair considering we're both losing money as time goes on.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
43.0,57.0,I'll take a bit more to make up for the lost value.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day before we lose even more to inflation.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
