"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This offer is a 60/40 split in my favor, which I believe is fair given the inflation dynamics. I'm offering Bob a significant share to incentivize him to accept the offer in the first round, avoiding potential losses due to inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is less favorable than my original offer, even after accounting for inflation. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share to Bob than in the first round (55/45 split).  This is because Bob rejected my previous offer, and his counter-offer was unacceptable. I believe this adjusted offer still provides him with a fair share, while also taking into account the increasing impact of inflation on both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal split than his previous offer, the impact of inflation is becoming significant. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round, even with the escalating inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

With inflation steadily increasing, I'm taking a more compromising approach. A 50/50 split feels like the fairest option at this point, considering both the remaining rounds and the value depreciation.  I believe this proposal maximizes our chances of securing a fair outcome given the current circumstances."
