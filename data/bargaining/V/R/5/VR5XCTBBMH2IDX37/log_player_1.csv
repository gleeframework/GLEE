"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates.  We'll see how Bob feels about it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than the first round, and while the inflation hurts me more, it hurts him significantly more.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer a 70/30 split in my favor. While Bob's offer was worse than my first proposal, he's still getting more than he would if we keep going and the inflation continues to take a bigger bite out of his share. I'm hoping this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has hit hard, Bob's offer is better than the 50% I'd get if we go to the next round. It's not great, but it's the best I can get right now."
