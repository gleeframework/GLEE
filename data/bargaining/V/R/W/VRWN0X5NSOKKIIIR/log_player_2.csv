"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  Considering the inflation, it's in your best interest to accept sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is generous, it's wise to see if I can get a better deal.  Since the money inflates at a higher rate for me, it's in my interest to wait and see if Alice will make a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your initial offer. However, the inflation works against you more than it does for me. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm confident we can find an agreement before the rounds run out."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the situation. How about a compromise? 56/44 split, still favors you considering the rapid devaluation of your share. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal. The inflation is affecting my share significantly, and I'm confident I can secure a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is making a deal harder with each round. Let's find a middle ground. I'm offering 58/42 split in my favor.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer,  and I believe we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but time is running out. 52/48 is my final offer.  This gives you a slight advantage considering the devaluation. Let's close this deal and avoid losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, the inflation is a real threat. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, unlike risking it all for a few extra dollars."
