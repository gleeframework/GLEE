I'm going for a greedy strategy initially, keeping the lion's share and giving Bob just a small amount.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation is going to hurt both of us. Accepting this offer is the most rational choice to ensure we both get something."
