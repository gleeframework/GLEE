Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob 4000, which is 40% of the total amount. I'm keeping 6000 for myself, which is 60% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.
