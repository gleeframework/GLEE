"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is as generous as it seems. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal, taking into account that the money is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less in round 2 + 20% less in round 3).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a significant share, but willing to give you a small consolation prize. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a larger share, but I'm not sure if it's worth it for me. Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth significantly less.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the long-term implications of accepting this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal, taking into account that the money is worth 68.8% less than in the first round (20% less in round 2 + 20% less in round 3 + 28.8% less in round 4).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a better deal. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and protecting my own interests."
