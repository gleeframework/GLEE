"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his gain of $60 is actually equivalent to $48 in the first round. My gain of $40 is still equivalent to $40.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly larger share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values for Bob's offer in the first round. Since the money is worth 48.8% less, his gain of $80 is equivalent to $80 / (1 - 0.488) = $80 / 0.512 = $156.25 in the first round.

That's a very generous offer from Bob, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it...

After considering the offer, I'll accept it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
