Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think it's fair for me to take the larger share since I have to deal with a bigger inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be reasonable here.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than in my last offer, but we need to make progress.  The inflation is hurting both of us, and the longer we wait, the less we both get. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While this is the same offer Alice made in Round 1, Bob is now facing significant inflation. Accepting ensures Alice gets a reasonable share, and avoids the risk of getting a much worse deal in later rounds as the value diminishes."
