"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave Bob with 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of my gain due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to adjust my valuation of the offer accordingly.

Considering the reduced value of my gain, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money I gain by 10% (5% in the first round and another 5% in the second round), I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
