I'm willing to concede a bit more to reach an agreement.  This offer still gives me more than Bob's last proposal, but it's close enough that we can hopefully end this before inflation eats away too much more of my share."

Round 9

I need to get something, even if it's a small amount.  Given the inflation, this is the best I can do while still having a chance of getting a deal.  Hopefully, Bob will realize that we're both losing money the longer this goes on."

Bob is being incredibly unreasonable. I'm not going to accept such a terrible deal. We are both losing money with each passing round! I'll try to make a counteroffer, but it's getting pretty risky."

This is a very risky offer, but I need to try something to get a deal.  Given the inflation, this is the best I can do while still having a chance of getting a deal.

This is an insult!  Bob is taking advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in.  I'd rather get nothing than be treated like this.  We both lose."
