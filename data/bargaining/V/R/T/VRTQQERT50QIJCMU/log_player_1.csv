"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward division of the $100. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll consider it carefully.

Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $40 x 0.9 = $36
* Bob's gain: $60 x 0.9 = $54

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I think I can live with it. I'll accept Bob's offer.
