"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new numbers, my 500,000 is worth 5% less, which is 475,000, and Bob's 500,000 is worth 20% less, which is 400,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
