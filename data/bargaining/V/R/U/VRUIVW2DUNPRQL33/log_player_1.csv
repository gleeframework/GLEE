"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. This way, we both get a decent share and can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, let's see what you think of this fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

In this round, I'm considering the offer of 50-50 split. I'm not sure if it's the best I can get, but it's a fair split. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
