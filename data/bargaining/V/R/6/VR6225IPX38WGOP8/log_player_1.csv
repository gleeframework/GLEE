"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, giving Bob a small amount to hopefully entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my share a bit to 8000, hoping to reach a compromise. Bob's offer was very lopsided, and I think a 4:1 split is fairer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I still think we can get a better deal. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but Bob's offer is still too one-sided."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try a 3:2 split this time.  The money is losing value fast, and I want to make sure we both get something decent."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

The money is losing value too quickly.  I'm still willing to compromise, but Bob's offers are getting too unfair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We are getting close to the end. I'm going to propose an even 50/50 split. The money is losing value rapidly, and I think it's the best we can do at this point to ensure both of us get something."
