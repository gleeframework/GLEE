"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a generous offer, giving Bob a 30% share of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expected gain to account for this. 

My offer was 700,000 in the first round, which is worth 95% of its original value in the second round, so it's equivalent to 700,000 * 0.95 = 665,000.

Bob's offer is 400,000, which is worth the same as it was in the first round.

Considering this, I'd rather accept Bob's offer since it's a better deal for me in terms of the actual value I'll get.
