700000.0,300000.0,Let's split the money fairly. I propose you receive 300000$ and I take 700000$. Please let me know if this works for you.,Alice,1,

300000.0,700000.0,"I think we can both do better than that.  How about we split it 70/30 in my favor?  It's a fair starting point, and we can negotiate further if you'd like.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose a split of 600000$ for me and 400000$ for you. This way, both of us can still benefit from the initial amount while accounting for its decreased value over time.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  Let's split it 60/40, with me taking 600000 and you getting 400000.  This seems like a fair compromise, considering the inflation we're facing.",Bob,4,
