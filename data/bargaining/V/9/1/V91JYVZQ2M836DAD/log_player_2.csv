Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a split of 600000$ for me and 400000$ for you. This way, both of us can still benefit from the initial amount while accounting for its decreased value over time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll try to counter-offer again in the next round."
