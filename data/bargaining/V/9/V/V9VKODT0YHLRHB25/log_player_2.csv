Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me less than 60% of the money. We need to find a solution that's fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is more reasonable this round, accepting now would still give me significantly less than what I believe is fair given the faster rate of inflation affecting Alice. I'm willing to push further into the later rounds where my bargaining position strengthens due to the inflation disparity."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's finally be reasonable.  The longer we play, the less we both get.  A 50/50 split is fair, and will ensure we both get something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I could hold out for a potentially better deal in later rounds, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes the most sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is hitting Alice much harder than me. While I'm losing value, she's losing it at twice the rate. This means her willingness to settle for a less favorable deal will increase with each passing round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Waiting longer *might* lead to a slightly better offer from Alice, but it also significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, while not ideal in earlier rounds, has become increasingly fair given the changing value of the money due to inflation.

Accepting now guarantees a significant sum and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
