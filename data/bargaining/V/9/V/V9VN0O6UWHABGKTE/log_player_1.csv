"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40 dollars and keep 60 dollars for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a fairer starting point. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with the 55-45 split, especially since the money is worth the same to me as it was in the first round. I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 43 dollars and keep 57 dollars for myself. Since Bob proposed a 55-45 split and I initially proposed a 60-40 split, I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on. The message conveys my willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also mindful of the diminishing value of the money with each round.  A 50-50 split feels like the fairest solution at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept the 50-50 split. Given that the money is worth the same to me as it was in the first round, I think this is a fair deal. Additionally, considering the diminishing value of the money for Bob, I believe this is a reasonable compromise. Let's shake on it and end the game!
