"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $80 and Bob will get $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were generous in the first round, but I'm hoping for a bit more this time around. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll get $32 (80 x 0.4) and Bob will get $60.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to give you all the money!""
}
```

With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll get $12.8 (30 x 0.4265, since 0.4^2 = 0.16 and 1 - 0.16 = 0.84, and 30 x 0.84 = 25.2, then 25.2 x 0.5 = 12.6 and 12.6 x 1.04 = 13.104, and 13.104 x 0.98 = 12.8)."
