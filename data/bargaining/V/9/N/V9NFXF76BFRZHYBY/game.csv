700000.0,300000.0,I propose dividing the money 700000 for me and 300000 for you in the first round. Let's make the most of our shares before the value decreases.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to compromise. It's still worth more to you than to me, considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose we split the money equally this round. This way, we both maintain a fair share while minimizing potential loss due to decreasing value.",Alice,3,

425000.0,575000.0,"I understand the dynamics of this game. My proposal this round is to give you a bit more than last time, with a slight decrease in my share. This might help in reaching an agreement, considering the diminishing value of money.",Alice,5,
