"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\nI'll start by proposing a division that seems fair, considering the rules of the game. Since Bob doesn't lose any value over rounds, but I do, I'll aim for a slight advantage to account for potential future losses. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering my risk.""
}
```

This division gives me a slight edge to compensate for the potential loss in value over rounds, while also being mindful of Bob's perspective to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. I think that's the fairest way to do it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2

Considering the offer and the impact of inflation, I need to calculate the actual value I'd receive. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, the $50 offered is actually worth $45 in terms of the original value. Given this, and the fact that I initially aimed for a higher gain to offset potential losses, I find this offer less appealing. I'll reject it in hopes of negotiating a better split in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 3

Given the rejection and the ongoing inflation, my next offer needs to consider the decreasing value of the money for me, while still aiming for a mutually acceptable division. Since the value decreases by 10% each round for me, I must adjust my expectations accordingly. However, I also need to be mindful of Bob's perspective to avoid rejection. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground.""
}
```

This offer slightly reduces my initial gain to make it more appealing to Bob, while still accounting for the loss in value due to inflation. I'm aiming for a compromise that acknowledges both our positions."
