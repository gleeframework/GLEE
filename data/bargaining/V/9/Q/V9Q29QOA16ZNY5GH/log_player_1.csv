"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my offer in the previous round would have been worth 80% of its original value, so I would have gained $4800 and Bob would have gained $3200.

Now, considering Bob's new offer, I'll calculate the effective value of the money after the inflation adjustment. Since Bob's offer is worth 90% of its original value (10% less than the original 100%), I would gain $4500 and Bob would gain $4500.

I accept Bob's offer.
