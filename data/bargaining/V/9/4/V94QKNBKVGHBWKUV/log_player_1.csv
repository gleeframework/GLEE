"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering that the money will be worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round), I'll make a new offer.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than the previous one, considering the reduced value of the money."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now.

I'll think carefully about this offer. It's a relatively close split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
