"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would get $500,000 and Bob would get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get the majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking. If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is 40% of the original $1,000,000.

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a decent share""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, where I would get $450,000 and Bob would get $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a good deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to reassess the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $300,000, which is only 30% of the original $1,000,000.

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

{""alice_gain"": 375000, ""bob_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent chunk""}
