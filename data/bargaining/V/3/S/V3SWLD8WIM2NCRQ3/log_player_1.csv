"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful.

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll have to think carefully. I'm not sure if I want to give up 60% of the original amount for a 50% share in this round.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 40% of its original value for me and 90% of its original value for Bob, I'll make a new offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth more to Bob, so I'm offering a slightly larger share to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the situation.

Bob's offer is a 45-55 split, which is a bit closer to a 50-50 split than my previous offer. Considering the value of the money is decreasing faster for me, I'll think about accepting this offer.

I'll accept the offer.
