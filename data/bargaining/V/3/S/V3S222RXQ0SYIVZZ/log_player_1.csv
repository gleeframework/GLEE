"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. I think this is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, I'll take 70% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I can accept this offer. I'm only getting 30% of the total, which is a pretty low offer. I was thinking of getting at least 40-45% of the total.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split.""}

I'm willing to give up some of my share to get a deal done, but I'm still hoping to get at least 40% of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting closer to accepting, but I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping to get a bit more, considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money.

However, I don't want to risk going back to the start and losing more value due to further inflation. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in future rounds.
