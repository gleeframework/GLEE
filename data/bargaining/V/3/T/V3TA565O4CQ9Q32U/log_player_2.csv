# Alice's message: Come on, let's be reasonable! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to a more balanced split, time is working against me faster than it is against Alice.  I need to push for a more advantageous position quickly, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer: a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it - we both lose out if this goes on.""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  Continually pushing for a marginal advantage is becoming increasingly risky. A 50/50 split is the fairest offer and gives Alice a strong incentive to accept, avoiding a total loss for both of us as inflation eats away at the value."
