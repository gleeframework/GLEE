Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try to find a split we're both comfortable with. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is running out.  At this rate, the longer we wait, the less favorable any offer will become due to inflation disproportionately impacting me.  I need to incentivize Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  We're both losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me!  While this isn't a great deal, it's better than what I was offered in Round 2, and significantly better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
