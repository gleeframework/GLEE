"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good compromise between our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less now, I'm not as eager to accept a 50/50 split as I was initially. However, I still think it's a decent offer. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
