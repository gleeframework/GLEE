Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's not how this works, Alice. I'm feeling generous, so here's a better offer for you to consider. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems you're having trouble grasping the concept of a fair deal. I'm lowering my cut to give you one last chance. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is dramatically undervaluing the impact of inflation on his own gains. While his offer seems ""generous"" on the surface, accepting it would mean settling for significantly less than what I could gain by waiting him out. He's clearly hoping I'll crack under the pressure, but I need to remain firm in my position."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a lifeline here. Accept this, and you salvage a decent amount. Each round that passes costs you dearly. Don't be greedy.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome.  Take it or leave it, but I won't go any lower. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, this offer is now within the realm of acceptance.  Bob seems entrenched and unwilling to budge further. The longer this drags on, the less significant the difference between his 500,000 and a potentially slightly higher amount becomes. Taking the sure thing now prevents further losses from his perspective, even if those losses are disproportionately impacting him."
