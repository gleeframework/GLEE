"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

I'm not thrilled about the huge disparity in the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the opportunity cost of rejecting this offer.

For now, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let's think about a new proposal...

I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less than before, I'll aim to give him a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, with a slightly larger share for Bob to account for the reduced value of his money."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on Bob's share!

I'm not thrilled about the huge disparity in this offer, but I'll think about it...

Since my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll weigh the benefits of accepting this offer. The 250,000 I'd get is still a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's worth giving up a significant portion of the total amount.

For now, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let's think about a new proposal...

I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Since Bob's money is worth significantly less than before, I'll aim to give him a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 360000, ""bob_gain"": 640000}

I'm proposing a 36/64 split, with a larger share for Bob to account for the reduced value of his money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wow, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share!

I'm not thrilled about the tiny share I'd get in this offer, but I'll think about it...

Since my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll weigh the benefits of accepting this offer. The 100,000 I'd get is a small consolation, but I'm not sure if it's worth giving up a significant portion of the total amount.

For now, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let's think about a new proposal...

I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Since Bob's money is worth a tiny fraction of what it was initially, I'll aim to give him a larger share to compensate for the extreme inflation.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 220000, ""bob_gain"": 780000}

I'm proposing a 22/78 split, with a larger share for Bob to account for the extreme reduction in the value of his money.

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
