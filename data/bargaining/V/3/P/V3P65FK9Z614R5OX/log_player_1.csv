"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I'll take 999,999 dollars and leave Bob with 1 dollar.  This way, I maximize my share in the first round before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better deal, accepting this offer is the best course of action. With inflation, my potential gains in future rounds would be significantly lower than the current offer."
