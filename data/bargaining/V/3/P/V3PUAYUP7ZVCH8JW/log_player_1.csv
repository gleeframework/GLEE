"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 80-20""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, no need for negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,500.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation effect on my end."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. Considering the 27.1% loss in value, my gain of $4,000 is now worth around $2,928.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially considering the significant devaluation of my potential gain due to inflation."

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""I'm walking away, you get the rest""
}
```

I'm proposing a 10-90 split, giving me $1,000 and Bob $9,000. It's a long shot, but I'm hoping Bob will take pity on me and accept this offer."
