"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer seems generous, it's important to consider the inflation.  Rejecting this offer gives me a chance to propose a more favorable split in the next round, and hopefully, get a better deal before the value of the money decreases too much."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting worse with each round, even though the money is worth less to me.  I'll reject and see if she'll come up with something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The value of the money is dropping rapidly. While I'd prefer a more even split, the offer is becoming increasingly less favorable each round. Accepting this deal is the best way to ensure I get something rather than nothing."
