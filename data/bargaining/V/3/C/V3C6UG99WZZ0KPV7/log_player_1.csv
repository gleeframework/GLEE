"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $45, which is a relatively fair deal, considering that the money loses value for him over time. I also included a message suggesting that we close the deal quickly to avoid further losses due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be realistic. This offer won't be as good in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait for a better offer. Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not convinced. The offer of $40 for me is not very generous, especially since I initially offered him a relatively fair deal. I'll reject this offer and see what happens in the next round.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money loses value for Bob over time. Since he's under pressure to close the deal, I'll make a slightly less generous offer than my initial one.
{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's close the deal before it's too late""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my share to $58, while still offering Bob a significant amount. The message is designed to create a sense of urgency, emphasizing that the longer we wait, the less valuable the money becomes for Bob. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance, Alice! The clock is ticking and the deal is getting worse for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","At this point, Bob is getting desperate, and his message reflects that. However, considering that the money doesn't lose value for me, I'm still in a good position. Bob's offer of $45 for me is actually an improvement over his previous offer, but it's still not as good as my initial proposal.

Given that Bob is under pressure due to the inflation, I'll reject this offer and see what happens in the next round. It's possible that he'll be willing to make an even better offer to avoid further losses.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","At this point, Bob is likely getting anxious to close the deal, given that the money is losing significant value for him. I'll take advantage of this situation by making an offer that's slightly more favorable to me than my previous ones.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob. You won't get a better deal than this""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've increased my share to $60, while still giving Bob a substantial amount. The message is designed to convey that this is the best offer he'll get from me, and that he should accept it before the money loses even more value. Let's see how Bob responds!"
