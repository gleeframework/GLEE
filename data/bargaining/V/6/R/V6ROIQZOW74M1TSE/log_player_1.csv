"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, taking the lion's share.  I want to see how Bob reacts and if he's willing to negotiate.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much better than my initial proposal, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion of the money.  We've only had one round, and I'm not feeling desperate yet.  I'll counter with my own offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, aiming for a more balanced split. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a good portion of the money.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, so I want to be careful but not too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd consider a fair split, but I still think I can get a better deal.  I'm not yet willing to settle for such a small proportion, especially with inflation biting away at the value of the money.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  We're getting close to the middle of the game, and the pressure of inflation is increasing. I think a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get a decent amount of money before it loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, the inflation is really starting to bite. With six rounds gone, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  I'd rather secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing at all."
