"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, as it's the first round and the potential for inflation is high. However, it also provides a decent amount for Bob to potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is not ideal, the inflation is starting to take a toll. Accepting this offer guarantees a good amount of money, whereas rejecting it risks losing more in the next rounds due to the increasing inflation."
