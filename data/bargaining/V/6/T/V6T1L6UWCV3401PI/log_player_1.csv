"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair and simple proposal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 900,000 * 0.9 = 810,000
* Bob's gain: 100,000 * 0.8 = 80,000

Bob's offer is to split it down the middle, but with the inflation adjustments, I'd be getting 810,000 and Bob would be getting 80,000. I'd be getting a significantly larger share, which doesn't seem very ""down the middle"" to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 810,000 * 0.9 = 729,000
* Bob's gain: 80,000 * 0.8 = 64,000

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take 300,000 and let's end this.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share than before, but still getting the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective amounts considering the inflation:

* My gain: 810,000 * 0.729 = 589,43
* Bob's gain: 80,000 * 0.512 = 40,96

Now, with the new inflation rates, the effective amounts are:
* My gain: 589,43 * 0.927 = 545,11
* Bob's gain: 40,96 * 0.5168 = 21,16

Bob's offer is to give me 600,000 and take 400,000. This is a significant increase in the share I get, but I'm not sure if it's enough to accept.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 545,11 * 0.9 = 490,00
* Bob's gain: 21,16 * 0.8 = 16,93

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50/50 and end this.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, but still willing to compromise and split the money 50/50."
