"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk of inflation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's gain, I'm not as concerned about his proposal. I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I deserve only $4000, considering the initial proposal was a 50/50 split. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think 70/30 is a fair split considering the risks and the initial proposal.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."

# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation that's affecting Bob's gain, I think his offer is a bit more reasonable. However, I still think I deserve a bit more. I'll consider this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I should accept a 58/42 split, especially considering the initial 50/50 proposal. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'm not convinced that I should accept a 76/24 split, especially considering the initial 50/50 proposal and the significant risk Bob is taking. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
