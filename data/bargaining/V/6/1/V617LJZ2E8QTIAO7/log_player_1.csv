Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a chance. This is a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round.  Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob knows about the inflation impacting me and is unlikely to offer anything better.  His message suggests he's willing to gamble on me rejecting his offer in hopes of getting even more in a future round.

While getting $4,000 is less than my initial offer, it's better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds due to the steep inflation."
