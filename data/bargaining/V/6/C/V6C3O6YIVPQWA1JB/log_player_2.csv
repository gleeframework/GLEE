Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a bigger share. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier! While her offer is better than her previous one, accepting now would mean losing a significant amount to inflation.  We're still in the early stages, and I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a larger share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or I'm moving on. We both lose if this drags on!"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:**  I'm applying direct pressure by stating I'm close to walking away. This might push Alice to accept a less favorable deal. 
* **Slight Concession:** Offering slightly less than my previous offer (550,000) might make Alice believe I'm compromising and encourage her to do the same.
* **Inflation Awareness:** While not ideal, this offer still nets me a good amount considering inflation. It's a calculated risk to avoid walking away with nothing."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm coming down a bit, but we're getting close to a reasonable split.  Let's end this now and get our money! 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing rapidly.
* **Inflation Impact:**  The inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains with every passing round. Accepting now limits further losses.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice's offer mirrors my last one. It seems she's reached her limit, and further haggling might not yield better results. 

It's better to accept a decent offer now than risk ending up with nothing."
