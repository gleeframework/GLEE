"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This is my final offer.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Position:**  Since Alice's offer was rejected, she knows I'm serious about getting a better deal. 
* **Inflation Factor:** While the money devalues for both of us, it affects me more significantly (20% vs. 5%).  It's in my best interest to settle this quickly.
* **Strategic Pressure:** By stating it's my final offer, I'm putting pressure on Alice to accept. She risks getting a worse deal in further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm hoping you'll reconsider 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value fast, especially for me.  Waiting any longer will only hurt my potential gain more.
* **Marginal Difference:**  While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's only slightly worse than what I proposed in Round 2 considering the inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's no guarantee I can get a better deal in further rounds. Alice might be getting more stubborn, and the money will continue to devalue."
