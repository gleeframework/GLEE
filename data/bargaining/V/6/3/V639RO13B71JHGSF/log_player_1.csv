"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. An even split is the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","An even split is a fair proposal, but I'd like to try to get a bit more.

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round."
