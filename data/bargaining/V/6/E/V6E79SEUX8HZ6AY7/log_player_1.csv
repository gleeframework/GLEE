"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, with me getting 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my initial offer would have been equivalent to 600,000 * 0.95 = 570,000, so Bob's offer is actually better than mine.

I accept Bob's offer.
