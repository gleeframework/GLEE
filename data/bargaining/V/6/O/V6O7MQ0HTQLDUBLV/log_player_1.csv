"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll propose a very generous split, keeping the vast majority for myself.  Since this is the first round, I figure Bob might be willing to accept a small amount just to get something.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's clear Bob is not going to accept anything less than half.  With inflation, it's better to take what I can get now than risk losing more later."
