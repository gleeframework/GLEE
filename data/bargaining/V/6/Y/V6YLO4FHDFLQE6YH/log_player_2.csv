"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept, but remember inflation! If we reject, we can potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more this time, but still think we can find a fair split.  Inflation means we both need to get the most we can now!""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation makes this a good deal. Accepting this offer guarantees me a large share, while rejecting means I risk getting a worse deal later due to inflation."
