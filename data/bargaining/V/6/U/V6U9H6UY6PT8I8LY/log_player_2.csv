# Alice gain: 5500

# Alice's message: Inflation is killing your share, take it while you can 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, but time is really working against me.  Alice is clearly going to bleed me dry with these offers. Taking the $4,300 now is better than risking getting even less later or nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
