"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in Round 1 was 8000 for me and 2000 for Bob, which is still a better deal for me than Bob's offer of 6000 for me and 4000 for Bob. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll think strategically. Bob's offer of 5000 for both of us is a 50/50 split, which is a fair division considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
