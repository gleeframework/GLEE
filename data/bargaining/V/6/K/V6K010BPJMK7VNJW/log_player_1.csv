"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to keep 900,000 dollars for myself, and give 100,000 dollars to Bob.  Let's see if he accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I accept Bob's offer. It's a fair split, and given the inflation, I'd rather secure 500,000 dollars now than risk getting less in the next round."
