"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a decent chunk. Let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While $50,000 is a decent chunk, I'm hoping to get more. I'm also not sure how the inflation affects Alice, so I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the potential for inflation.  Let's call it a day and both walk away happy.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to make it worth my while.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I'm concerned about inflation.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant gain, and Alice is clearly not going to budge much further."
