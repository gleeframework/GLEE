"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round ($800,000), but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round ($200,000 * 0.8 = $160,000).

I accept this offer.
