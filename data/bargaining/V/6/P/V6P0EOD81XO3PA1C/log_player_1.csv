"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to take a bit more, huh?

I'll think for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 10$ just yet. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% from the first round + 5% from the second round), I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a bit more and keeping some value for myself."
