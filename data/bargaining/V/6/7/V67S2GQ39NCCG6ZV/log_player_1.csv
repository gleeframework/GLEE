"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's a relatively fair starting point, considering I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain more severely, I need to be more aggressive. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation is affecting my gain more severely, I'll try to get a larger share now. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's still a relatively aggressive move considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain even more severely, I need to be even more aggressive to get a decent share. However, Bob's offer is relatively close to my previous offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll accept this offer.
