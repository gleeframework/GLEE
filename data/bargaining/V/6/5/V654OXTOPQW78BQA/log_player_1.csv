"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a simple offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40/60, I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we split the money evenly, but I'll still get a slight edge due to the inflation difference."
