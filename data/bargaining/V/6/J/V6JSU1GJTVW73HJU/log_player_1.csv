"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
```

This is a fair offer, as it splits the money almost equally. It's also a good starting point, and I'm curious to see if Bob will accept or try to get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I didn't get the initial split I proposed, this is a fair offer considering inflation. I'm happy to take this deal."
