"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the initial $100, which is $10, and keeping 90% for myself, which is $90. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is fair.  Let's start with this and see where we can go. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 20% less than the $90 I could have gotten in the first round, so it's actually worth $36.

Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is a more equitable split than my initial offer. However, considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so it's now worth 20% of $36, which is $7.20.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""This is my next offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the remaining $100, which is $30, and keeping 70% for myself, which is $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This is a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $70 in Round 3 is now worth 51.2% of the original $90, which is $45.96. But since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain is actually worth 51.2% of the original $90, which is $46.08, but due to the inflation, it is now worth 51.2% of the original 80% of the original $100, which is $46.08 * 0.8 = $36.8664, which is approximately $36.87.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a very fair deal considering the current state of the money. I'm not sure if I should take it, but I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation.
