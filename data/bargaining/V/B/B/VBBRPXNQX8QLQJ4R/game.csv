90.0,10.0,Let's start with a simple split. I think it's fair for me to get the majority since I'm the one making the first offer.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,I think a more even split is fairer. Let's start with 60/40.  We can always adjust later if we need to.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Let's be a little more reasonable.  55/45 is a fair compromise, and we can move closer to a 50/50 split in the next round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's just split it down the middle. 50/50 is the most fair and avoids any further negotiation.,Bob,4,
