"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $50. This is a reasonable starting point, and it's a good way to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively equal split."
