"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving me 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather have a larger share in the current round to compensate for the reduced value. Bob's offer is actually more generous than my initial offer, but I'll still try to get a better deal.

I reject Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to get a larger share in this round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share than Bob's previous offer, taking into account the reduced value of money due to inflation."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting closer, but I'd like to try to get an even better deal. Bob's offer is still not as generous as I'd like, considering the reduced value of money due to inflation.

I reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect taking a toll, I'll aim to get an even larger share in this round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 575000,
  ""bob_gain"": 425000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share than my previous offer, taking into account the reduced value of money due to inflation."

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting closer, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that's not as favorable to me as I'd like. Since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation, I'd like to try to get an even better deal.

I reject Bob's offer from round 6.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect taking a significant toll, I'll aim to get an even larger share in this round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer is a return to my initial offer, but considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm essentially offering a larger share in real terms."
