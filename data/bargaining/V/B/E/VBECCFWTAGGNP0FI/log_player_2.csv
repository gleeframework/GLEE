Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still need a bit more! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is slightly better, time is working heavily against me.  Alice is very slowly moving towards a more fair deal, likely hoping I'll panic as the rounds progress. I need to push for a much better split in the next round or two before inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My share is shrinking fast!  Meet me halfway and we can both walk away with something.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, Bob. The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, but time is running out.  Alice knows I'm getting desperate. Accepting this offer at least nets me something, even though it's heavily in her favor. If I reject it, the inflation will make even an even split in later rounds worse than this offer."
