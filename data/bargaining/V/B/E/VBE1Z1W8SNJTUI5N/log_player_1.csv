"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see how it goes!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, let's try to improve on that! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm glad Bob thinks we're starting with a fair split.

Considering the inflation, my $5,000 gain in this round is actually worth 80% of what it would have been in the first round. Still, it's a good offer, and I don't want to risk going into another round.
