"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether this is a good deal.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob is being generous or trying to trick me, but I think I can do better than this. I'll wait for the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the division of the money."
