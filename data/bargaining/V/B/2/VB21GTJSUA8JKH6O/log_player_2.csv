Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. My offer is fair and saves us both time. The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While the offer is slightly better than her first one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the money is losing value quickly for both of us. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer deal."

{

""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting dangerously close to losing a significant chunk of this money. I'm proposing a split that's slightly more in my favor, reflecting the faster rate of inflation I'm facing. Let's close this deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. We're both losing money by dragging this out. Let's settle and walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice presents her offer as a compromise, it's barely budged from her previous position. The longer this drags on, the more it favors her because of the difference in inflation rates. Accepting now would be letting her dictate the terms completely. I need to hold firm and hope she gets more reasonable as the deadline approaches."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a very fair split acknowledging the impact of inflation on both our positions. If you reject this, I'm prepared to take my chances in later rounds, even with the risks involved."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure by presenting this as my ""final offer"" while still aiming for a reasonably balanced split.  This signals firmness on my part and highlights the risk for Alice that I might adopt a more aggressive approach in later rounds if she continues to refuse. This could push her towards accepting a less favorable deal than she might get otherwise as we get closer to the deadline."
