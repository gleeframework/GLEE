"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair compromise considering we both had the opportunity to make an offer and rejected each other's proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I propose a 45/55 split in Bob's favor.  Inflation is starting to bite, and I need to make concessions to avoid getting nothing. This offer is still close to a 50/50 split, and I believe Bob will be more likely to accept it than my previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, inflation is rapidly devaluing the money, and it's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all."
