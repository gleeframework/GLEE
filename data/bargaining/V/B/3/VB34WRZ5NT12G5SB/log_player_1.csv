"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm keeping most of it! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the actual values are:
My gain: 2000 * 0.8 = 1600
Bob's gain: 8000 * 0.8 = 6400

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80% of 100% of $10,000), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 40-60!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not going to give in too much! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:
My gain: 5000 * 0.516 (80% * 80% * 80% * 64.8% * 80%) = 2580
Bob's gain: 5000 * 0.516 = 2580

It seems we're at a stalemate. I'll accept this offer.
