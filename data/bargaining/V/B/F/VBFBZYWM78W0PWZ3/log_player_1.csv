"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $360,000, which is still a decent amount. I'll accept Bob's offer.
