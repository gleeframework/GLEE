# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll respond with my decision:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the inflation and the fact that the money is worth the same to me in every round, I think this is a fair deal. Plus, considering Bob's loss of value over time, it's reasonable to meet in the middle. Let's conclude the game here."
