"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth less now, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. However, Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him, so I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it and try to negotiate further.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, and Bob's share is worth 5% less than in round 2.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself this time, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"
