"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation we both face.  Let's get this done before we lose too much! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I understand Bob's concern about inflation. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

Let's finalize the split and move on to the next round!"
