"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I don't think meeting in the middle is a bad idea, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, I'll take 55""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has hit again, and my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round. Bob's gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm still not giving up""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting tough!

With inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'll accept it this time. It's a relatively small concession, and I don't want to risk going to another round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
