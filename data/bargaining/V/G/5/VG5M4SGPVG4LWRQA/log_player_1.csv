"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I could try to take advantage of the inflation mechanic to get more in later rounds. However, starting with a somewhat fair offer might encourage Bob to accept early on, securing us both a decent amount before the money loses value. The message aims to convey a sense of fairness and cooperation, hoping to appeal to Bob's willingness to settle the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a more favorable split. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, accepting $35 that's worth 20% less than in the first round would significantly reduce my gain. Given the early stage of the game and the substantial difference in the impact of inflation on our earnings, I believe there's room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable split. Proceeding to the next round allows me to make a counteroffer that might better account for the inflationary loss."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust and find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer slightly to account for the inflation, offering Bob a bit more than in the first round but still aiming to secure a larger share for myself. The message emphasizes finding a middle ground, acknowledging the impact of inflation and encouraging Bob to consider the decreasing value of the money for both of us. By doing so, I'm attempting to negotiate a settlement that we can both accept before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's a reasonable deal given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential earnings, with the money now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most reasonable decision. Although Bob's gain is higher, the difference in how inflation affects us means that prolonging the game further would likely result in diminishing returns for me. Since Bob frames this as their final offer, there's a risk that they might not be willing to compromise further, making acceptance the safer choice to secure some value before it degrades even more."
