"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a good foundation to build on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the split, but I think Bob's message makes sense. Considering the inflation, a 55-45 split isn't terrible. I'll accept this offer.
