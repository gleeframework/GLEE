"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess in the next round""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer this time, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd like to get a better deal, considering the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and I'm not sure how much the inflation affects Bob's gain. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split this time, taking into account the 5% reduction in value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a slight improvement, the difference between 4500 and 5500 is still relatively small, and I'd like to get a better deal considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation. I'll wait for a more substantial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value. I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, so I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 4800, trying to account for the significant reduction in value due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a more generous split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to give away too much more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, at this point, I'd rather get a guaranteed 5000 than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come. The inflation is making the money's value drop rapidly, and I don't want to wait and potentially end up with less."
