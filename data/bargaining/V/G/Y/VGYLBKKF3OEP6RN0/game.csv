60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal that gives us both a good share.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think 60/40 is a bit biased, how about we do 55/45? It's a more even split.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?  It's better than what awaits us if we wait longer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"I see we're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 58/42? The longer we wait, the more you'll lose to inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  I'm offering 52/48 - it's the most generous offer you'll get at this point if we want to both walk away with something worthwhile.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"I know inflation is hurting your share, but I'm not feeling generous. How about 60/40? It's a better deal for me, and you should take it before your share is worth even less.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the definition of fair, and the longer we wait, the less we both gain. Let's end this now and both walk away with something.",Alice,7,
