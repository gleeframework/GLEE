Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out.  This offer is the best I can do, and it still gives us both a decent amount.  Let's end this game and avoid losing even more money. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's time to accept.  

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is unlikely to offer more.  The value for both of us is decreasing rapidly. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, whereas continued rejection risks getting nothing at all."
