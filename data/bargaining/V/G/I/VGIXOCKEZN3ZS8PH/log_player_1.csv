"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively equal division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. Let's move on to the next round. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round.

I'll accept this offer.

```
