"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair in the initial round, it's better to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the subsequent rounds. The inflation rate will affect Alice's offer more, making it more likely she'll offer me a larger share in later rounds to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try flipping the script this time. You get a smaller share now, but the inflation will benefit you more in the later rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle this time. It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is a fair compromise. Since the inflation rate is affecting her more, she is likely to offer me less in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure a good chunk of the money before the inflation completely diminishes the value of our gains."
