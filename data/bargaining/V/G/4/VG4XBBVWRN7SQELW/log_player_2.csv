Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my first offer 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it closer to even, but I need more than 3500 to make it worthwhile for me with the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is really hurting you, isn't it? 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
At this point, Bob's gains are significantly reduced due to inflation, and it's better to accept any offer that gets him something. While the deal is unfavorable, it's better than getting nothing if Alice rejects the offer and the game continues."
