"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a generous 40% of the original amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'm not as eager to accept this offer. I'll reject it.

```

}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share this time, but still a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant reduction in value due to inflation, Bob's offer of 50/50 seems reasonable. I'll accept it.
