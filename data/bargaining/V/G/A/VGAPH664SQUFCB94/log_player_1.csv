"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 4000 dollars, which is 80% of what I could have gotten in the first round. However, Bob's gain is 6000 dollars, which is 120% of what he could have gotten in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to get more than his fair share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my offer to make it more favorable to myself. I'll offer a 55/45 split, which is slightly more in my favor.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A 55/45 split seems fair, considering the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4800, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm getting 4800 dollars, which is 96% of what I could have gotten in the first round. However, Bob's gain is 5200 dollars, which is 104% of what he could have gotten in the first round.

Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is still more than his original share, but not as much as in the previous round. I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
