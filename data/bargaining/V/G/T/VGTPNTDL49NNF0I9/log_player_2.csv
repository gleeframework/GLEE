"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I take the lion's share, but you still get a decent sum. Accept and we both move on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, the potential for a better deal exists. I want to see if I can negotiate a more equitable split, even though the offer is quite generous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I propose a more even split. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. Let's move forward with this fair deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This offer is fair given the inflation we're facing, and it allows us to avoid further risks. Let's end this game now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the risk of further inflation and the possibility of getting nothing at all make this offer appealing.  I'll accept,  ensuring a substantial gain for both of us."
