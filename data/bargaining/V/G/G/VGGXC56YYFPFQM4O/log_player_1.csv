"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. Given the inflation rates, I'm trying to find a balance that would be acceptable to both of us, considering that the value of money decreases more significantly for me with each round. The message aims to appeal to fairness while also acknowledging that I'm taking a slightly larger share, hoping Bob will find it reasonable enough to accept early on and minimize the impact of inflation on both our parts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, I'm feeling the inflation already! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Given the significant impact of inflation on my share (20% decrease in value each round), accepting $45 now would be less valuable than what I initially offered Bob in the first round. Since Bob is only experiencing a 5% decrease in value due to inflation, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more equitable division, considering the disparate effects of inflation on our shares. By rejecting this offer, I aim to push for a better deal in the next round, hoping that the prospect of further inflation might encourage Bob to offer a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making an offer that slightly reduces my initial gain, taking into account the significant impact of inflation on my share and the lesser impact on Bob's share. By proposing a division of $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, I'm aiming to find a middle ground that acknowledges the decreasing value of money for both of us but still recognizes the greater effect it has on my portion. The message is intended to convey a willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable division, considering the ongoing inflation and its disparate impacts on our potential gains."
