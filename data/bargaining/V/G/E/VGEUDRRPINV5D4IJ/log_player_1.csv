"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority this time 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not so generous, eh?

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a new one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, I'll make a new offer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up control yet 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is still trying to get the upper hand!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll calculate the actual values I'd receive:

Alice gain: 4000 / 0.854 (1 - 0.146) ≈ 4691
Bob gain: 6000 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273) ≈ 8243

Hmm, not a great deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not good enough, I'll try to do better""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Compromise is key, let's find a fair middle ground""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
