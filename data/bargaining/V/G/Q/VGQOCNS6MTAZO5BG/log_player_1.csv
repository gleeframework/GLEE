Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer to split the money evenly. While it's true that an even split is fair, I had initially proposed a slightly higher amount for myself, and I'm not ready to concede to a perfectly equal division just yet. Additionally, considering the inflation, I'd like to try and negotiate a better deal for myself before accepting a 50-50 split.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a division of $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, with a message suggesting that we meet in the middle of our previous offers. This is a compromise between my initial offer of 55-45 and Bob's offer of 50-50. I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable middle ground while still pushing for a slightly better deal for myself.\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision and any message he might send back."
