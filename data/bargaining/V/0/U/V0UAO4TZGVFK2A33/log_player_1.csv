"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm giving Bob 40% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game here. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage him to accept. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, last offer was too low""
}
```

I've reduced my initial offer slightly, taking into account the inflation, but still trying to meet Bob halfway. Let's see if he's willing to accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Trying to find a sweet spot 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5600,
  ""bob_gain"": 4400,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, don't let inflation eat it all""
}
```

I've reduced my offer a bit more, trying to find a compromise, while also considering the increasing effect of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer before the money loses even more value!"
