"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money 4:1 in favor of Alice. This is a fair split considering the value of money diminishes with each round.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Since you rejected my offer last round, I believe it's fair to take into account the decreasing value of the money with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
