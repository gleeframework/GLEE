70.0,30.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The value of the money is decreasing for you, not for me. I'm offering you $30, which is already more than it will be worth in the next round. Take the deal!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Considering the decreasing value of money for me, I'm willing to compromise. A 55-45 split is more than fair, given the circumstances. Don't push me to go further, or I'll be forced to make a lower offer in the next round!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking and every round hurts your share more. I'm offering you $35.  This is a fair deal considering the depreciation. Let's wrap this up!",Alice,5,
