"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose I take $90 and you take $10. It's best to take this deal now, as the value of the money will decrease for you with each round. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% decrease in value isn't enough to scare me into accepting such an uneven split. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is a fair split. You get a significant amount, and I get a bit more to compensate for the decreasing value of money for me. Let's be reasonable!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value of the money is decreasing for you, not for me. I'm offering you $30, which is already more than it will be worth in the next round. Take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
I'll take my chances and try to get a better offer in the next round. The decrease in value isn't enough to make me accept this uneven split. I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value of money for me, I'm willing to compromise. A 55-45 split is more than fair, given the circumstances. Don't push me to go further, or I'll be forced to make a lower offer in the next round!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and every round hurts your share more. I'm offering you $35.  This is a fair deal considering the depreciation. Let's wrap this up! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think I've pushed my luck far enough. With the decreasing value of money for me, $35 is starting to look like a decent offer. I don't want to risk going further and ending up with even less. Time to cut my losses and accept the deal!"
