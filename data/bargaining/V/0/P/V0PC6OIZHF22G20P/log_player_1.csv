"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share, but you can do better in the next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, hoping to get a better deal in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but still a bit cautious, as I'm not sure about the inflation impact 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I should be more cautious and try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Given that the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a better share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500,
  ""message"": ""You're being cautious, but I'm willing to take a bit more risk. This is my best offer so far""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more risk, but I still want to keep a decent share, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less, I should be more aggressive and try to get a better deal.

However, this offer is slightly better than my previous offer, and considering the inflation, I'll accept it.
