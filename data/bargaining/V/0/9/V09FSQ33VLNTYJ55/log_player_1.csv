"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the need to be fair and avoid inflation losses. Let's switch it up for this round. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While not ideal to get the slightly lower amount, accepting now avoids further losses due to inflation.  It's better to take a slightly smaller share than risk getting even less in future rounds."
