Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, I've compromised a bit, it's getting closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""This is a very serious offer, Alice. The clock is ticking and the value is decreasing.  I'm willing to meet you closer to your offer, but I need you to move a bit too.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, but I'm not budging much. This is a good deal, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are severely impacting Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $430,000 is better than risking further losses in subsequent rounds."
