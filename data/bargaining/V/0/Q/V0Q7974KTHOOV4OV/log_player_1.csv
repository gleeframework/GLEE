"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a decent chunk of the money, but leaves Bob with a decent amount as well.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my gain of $3000 is actually worth $2850 ($3000 * 0.95). Still a decent amount, but not as much as I would have liked.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was for a 70/30 split, I'll try to get a better deal for myself this time. I'll offer a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and the first round's gain was $6000, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $5176 ($6000 * 0.86).

This is a better deal for me than the previous offer, considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
