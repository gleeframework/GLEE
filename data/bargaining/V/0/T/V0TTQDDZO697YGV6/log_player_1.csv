"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try a more even split this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 gain from the first round is now worth $5,400.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept an even split just yet. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my $6,000 gain from the first round is now worth $5,400, and my $4,000 gain from the second round is now worth $3,600.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You were close, but I think I can get a better deal this time. Let's see what you think!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $4,200 and Bob gets $5,800."
