Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

 I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer. I want to get the game over quickly and avoid the inflation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is less than what I proposed in the first round, the inflation means that my potential gains are lower in each subsequent round. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something, as rejecting it could lead to a lower payout in the next round due to the continued inflation."
