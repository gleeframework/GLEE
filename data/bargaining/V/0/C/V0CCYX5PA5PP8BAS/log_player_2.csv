"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I think an even split is the fairest. Let's not lose any more to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation hits you harder 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This offer still gives you a slight advantage, but accounts for the inflation we both face. Let's be reasonable and end this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Each round I wait makes your share worth less, don't wait too long 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation difference. While waiting is risky, accepting such a low offer sets a bad precedent for future rounds. I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 46, ""alice_gain"": 54, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer is a compromise.  Let's be done with this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  

I'm slightly increasing my offer to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm holding firm on a larger share for myself. The longer this goes on, the worse the inflation gets for both of us, even if it's worse for me. A 46/54 split, while not ideal, is better than nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, don't let pride get in the way 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is getting dangerous, but I can't accept such a low offer. Alice is clearly playing hardball, knowing that the inflation hurts me more. However, accepting 38 sets a terrible precedent for the remaining rounds. I need to hold my ground a bit longer and hope she becomes more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit with this offer.  Let's end this before we both lose out.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to show some serious compromise. While 45/55 isn't good, we're running out of time and the inflation is eating into the value rapidly. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping she recognizes the urgency and that I'm willing to make a deal."
