"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get more than 40% of the original amount. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55-45 split. It's more than fair considering the inflation!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making an offer that gives me a bit more than half of the original amount, considering that the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, given that the money is worth 20% less for her with each passing round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  50/50 is the fairest option, especially with the inflation affecting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting this offer because, considering the inflation, getting 50% of the original amount is a good deal for me. Since the money is worth 19% less for me now, this offer is actually better than the one I made in the previous round. I don't think I can get a better deal in the next rounds, especially since the money will be worth even less. Let's take the 50/50 split and end the game here!
