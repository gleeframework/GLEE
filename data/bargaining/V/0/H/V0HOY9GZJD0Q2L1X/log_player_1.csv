"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. Since the value of money doesn't decrease for me but does for Bob, I'll use this to my advantage in negotiations. Starting with a higher offer that still seems somewhat fair gives room for compromise in later rounds if needed. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to set a tone of reasonableness, even though the offer itself is skewed in my favor.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, taking into account the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's offer seems more balanced at first glance, considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain but not mine, the real value of what Bob is offering me (4500) is actually less than half of the original amount when factoring in the future rounds and the impact of inflation on his share. My initial offer, though seemingly unfair, was strategically made with the knowledge of inflation's impact on Bob's share over time. Since the value of money remains constant for me but decreases for Bob with each round, I'm in a stronger negotiating position as the rounds progress. I'll wait for the next round to either make a slightly more favorable offer to Bob or see if he adjusts his proposal to a split that I find more acceptable.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is generous.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decreased my initial offer slightly, acknowledging Bob's attempt to find a middle ground in his previous offer. However, I've kept the majority of the share for myself, recognizing that the value of money remains constant for me but decreases for Bob. The message ""Considering inflation, this is generous"" aims to remind Bob of the impact of inflation on his share and to frame my offer as a compromise, given the circumstances. This strategy pressures Bob to either accept a deal that is less favorable to him due to inflation or continue negotiations, potentially leading to an even less favorable outcome for him in the next rounds.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
