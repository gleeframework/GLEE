"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With 11 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value to inflation in hopes of getting a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split. It's more in my favor, but we can both still walk away with a good amount.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and we're both losing money. This is my final offer, let's close the deal before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the money is losing value due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal than 42/58. Alice is losing more value than me due to inflation, so I'll try to use that to my advantage. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5700, ""alice_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more risk, but I think 57/43 is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's make a deal!""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to reach a deal soon. This is a compromise - I'm meeting you closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant loss of value due to inflation, I think it's time to accept the offer. The 45/55 split is closer to the middle ground, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next rounds. Let's close the deal!"
