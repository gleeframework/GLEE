"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward division of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $3200.

I don't think this offer is significantly better than my initial proposal, and I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and propose a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a big enough improvement, I'm willing to negotiate further""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain of $3200 from the previous round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $2560. I'll keep that in mind when making my next offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and I'll give you a slight edge""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give up my edge 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4200 from the previous round is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $2148.80.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as it seems Bob is still trying to maintain his edge. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough improvement, I'm still willing to negotiate""
