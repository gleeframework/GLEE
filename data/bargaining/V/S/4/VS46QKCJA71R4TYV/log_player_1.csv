"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more equitable this time, Alice. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I'd like a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the money is worth less, but I still want to maximize my gain. Bob's offer is a bit more equitable, but I think I can do better.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55% to him and 45% to me, I'll try to counter with an offer that's even more favorable to myself. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but still aim to maximize my gain.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. But I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk.""
}"
