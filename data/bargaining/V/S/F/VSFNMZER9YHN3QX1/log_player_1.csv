"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split""}\n\n###\nI offered a 60-40 split in my favor, hoping Bob would accept it and we could conclude the game quickly before inflation reduces the value of the money. The message ""Fair 60-40 split"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer gives you a larger share than you would get in the next round if you reject. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI decided to reject Bob's offer because, despite his claim that it gives me a larger share than I would get in the next round, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Additionally, Bob's gain of $4500 is still relatively high, and I think I can try to reduce it further. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I need to consider the decreased value when making my decision. I will try to make a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Counteroffer: slightly better split""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I decided to make a counteroffer that is slightly better for Bob than my initial offer, but still favorable to me. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I need to take that into account when making my offer. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it is a compromise between our previous proposals. The message ""Counteroffer: slightly better split"" aims to convey that I am willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution."
