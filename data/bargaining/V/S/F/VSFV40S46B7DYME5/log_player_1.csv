"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 55/45 split, which is more reflective of the fact that I'll be facing greater losses from inflation as the game progresses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
