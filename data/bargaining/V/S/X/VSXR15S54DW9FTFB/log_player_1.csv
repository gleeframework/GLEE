"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll have to consider the inflation factor. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, this means that Bob is offering me a smaller share of the actual value of the money.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 70% and keeping $700,000, while offering Bob $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's new offer. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, this means that Bob is offering me a larger share of the actual value of the money.

However, Bob is offering me $400,000, which is still less than my previous offer of $700,000. Considering the inflation factor, I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 80% and keeping $800,000, while offering Bob $200,000. I'm trying to push for a better deal, but I'm not giving up too much in case Bob accepts this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's analyze Bob's new offer. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, this means that Bob is offering me a smaller share of the actual value of the money.

However, I notice that Bob is offering me $250,000, which is still less than my previous offer of $800,000, but considering the inflation factor, it's actually a relatively better deal for me compared to my previous offer. I'm not sure if I should take it or wait for a better offer.

I'll accept this offer.
