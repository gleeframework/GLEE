"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd like to get a better deal. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 42-58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than my initial offer, but still relatively fair. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
