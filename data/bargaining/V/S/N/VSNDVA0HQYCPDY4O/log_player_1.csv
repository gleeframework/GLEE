Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor, since the inflation is going to hit Bob harder.  I'll take $900,000 and leave Bob with $100,000.  I'm curious to see if he'll accept this or try to negotiate a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer deal than my previous proposal, and the inflation is starting to bite.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount of money and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
