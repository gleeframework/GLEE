7000.0,3000.0,"Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that you lose value faster with each round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is a fairer split, considering the time pressure.",Bob,2,
,,"This is a bit closer to fair, Bob, but the time pressure affects you much more than me. Let's see what you offer in the next round.",Alice,2,reject

,,,Bob,3,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, we're approaching the halfway point. I'm offering a split that's slightly more in my favor, but still reasonable given the inflation. Let's end this before we both lose out.",Bob,4,
,,"While your offer is tempting, Bob, I think you're undervaluing the rate at which your potential gains decrease.  I'm confident we can reach a more agreeable outcome.",Alice,4,reject
6200.0,3800.0,"Bob, I'm holding firm on the principle of this division. However, I'm acknowledging the shrinking pot by offering you slightly more. Let's close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The value is decreasing with every round, and this back-and-forth is only hurting both of us.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly.",Bob,6,
,,"Alright, Bob, you drive a hard bargain. I'll accept the 50/50 split.",Alice,6,accept
