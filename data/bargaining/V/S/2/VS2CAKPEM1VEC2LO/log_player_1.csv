"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a decent chunk of the money. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less after the second round of inflation, I'll try to get an even bigger share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm taking a bigger risk by offering a smaller share to Bob, but I think it's worth it to get a bigger share for myself. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. I think I should take what I can get. I'll accept Bob's offer.
