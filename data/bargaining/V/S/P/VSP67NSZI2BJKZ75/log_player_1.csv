"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This is a 80-20 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering a slightly more favorable split than my initial offer, I'll consider accepting this one.
