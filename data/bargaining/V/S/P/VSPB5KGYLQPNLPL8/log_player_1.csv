"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as Alice.  I'm taking a slight risk, but I figure Bob will be happy to get 10% in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. My share is reduced by 20% due to inflation, but it's still a significant amount.  Rejecting this offer risks getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
