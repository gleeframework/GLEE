"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous yet! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79
* Bob gain: 4000 / 0.95 = 4210.53

Considering the slight improvement, I'll decide to reject this offer. My goal is to get a better deal, so I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to $7,000, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much either! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Initial $10,000 / 0.855 (1 - 0.1426) = $11,667.91
* Alice gain: 5000 / 0.855 = 5841.16
* Bob gain: 5000 / 0.855 = 5841.16

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are $5,841.16 for Alice and $5,841.16 for Bob. This offer is more balanced, and I'm not getting a bad deal. I'll decide to accept this offer.
