"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy in round 1, now it's your turn to lose! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject this offer since I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less than the previous round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still willing to give Bob a slightly larger share to try to reach an agreement."
