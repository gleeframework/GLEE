I propose that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. This is a very generous offer for Bob, as he'll still get something even if he doesn't accept it. I hope he'll see reason and accept this."

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still confident that I can get a fair share of the money. Bob needs to understand that the stakes are getting higher, and if he doesn't agree to a reasonable offer, we both risk getting nothing."

We are getting very close to the end of the game, and I am running out of room to compromise. I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest solution, and I hope Bob will agree."
