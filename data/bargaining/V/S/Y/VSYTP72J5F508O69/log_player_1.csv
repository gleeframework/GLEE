Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a more balanced split, with $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you.  This ensures we both get a significant portion while being fair. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
