"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal that gives Alice a $100,000 advantage right off the bat. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a more balanced split, with $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you.  This ensures we both get a significant portion while being fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly.  It's our last chance for a clean deal before inflation hurts us both. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and with inflation kicking in, it's likely we'll both end up with less if we continue.  Let's call it a day."
