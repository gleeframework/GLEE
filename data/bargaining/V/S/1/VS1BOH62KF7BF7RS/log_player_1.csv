"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned! 

Let me calculate the new values after inflation:
My gain of $4,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's now worth $3,200.
Bob's gain of $6,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's now worth $5,400.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
