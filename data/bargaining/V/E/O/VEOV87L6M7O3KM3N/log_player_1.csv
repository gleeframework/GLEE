"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a pretty standard 60-40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to reverse the split! I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split in his favor, I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a 55-45 split, a bit more in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
