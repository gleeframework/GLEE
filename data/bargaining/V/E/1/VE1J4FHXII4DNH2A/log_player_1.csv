Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on your side, I'm willing to offer a bit more to compensate, but I also need to consider my own interests. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round. Accepting $520,000 now is better than risking getting even less in future rounds.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has slightly increased his offer, recognizing the impact of inflation on me. While it's not a huge increase, it shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that Bob will offer more in subsequent rounds. He might become more steadfast in his position, putting me at a greater disadvantage.

Accepting this offer ensures I (Alice) get a reasonable amount, even if it's not the ideal split I might have hoped for at the start."
