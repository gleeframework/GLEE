"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the hassle of negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable way to divide the money. This will allow us both to get a decent share, and hopefully, we can end the game before inflation eats away too much of our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'm effectively gaining 7200$.

I'm not thrilled about the 45/55 split, but I think it's a decent offer considering the circumstances. I'd rather not risk waiting for a better offer and risk losing more value to inflation. 

I'll accept Bob's offer.
