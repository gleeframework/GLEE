"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a fair split is tempting, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the later rounds.  Inflation might be a factor for Alice, so I'll see if I can use that to my advantage."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable way to divide the money. This will allow us both to get a decent share, and hopefully, we can end the game before inflation eats away too much of our earnings.""}
