"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting $6,000, which is a decent amount. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Since Bob's offer was 4000 for me, I'll try to get more for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of Bob's share, I'm not sure if he's trying to make a fair offer or if he's trying to take advantage of the situation. Since my share is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll take a closer look at the offer.

In this case, I'll accept the offer, as it's a 50-50 split, which is a relatively fair division of the remaining funds.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
