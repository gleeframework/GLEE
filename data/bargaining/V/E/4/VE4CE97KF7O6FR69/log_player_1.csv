Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous with Bob and offering him $10, hoping he'll accept it and we can both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's better to take the $50 now than risk getting nothing!"
