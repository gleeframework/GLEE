""alice_gain"": 490000,

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome.  Let's end this now before we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's tempting to push for a slightly larger share, but the time pressure is becoming significant. Accepting a 50/50 split guarantees a reasonable outcome and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
