"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is far too one-sided in Alice's favor. It's worth exploring other possibilities."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair 50/50 split. We have a lot of rounds left to negotiate, and this is a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair given that we're already in the third round. Let's be reasonable and reach a deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still quite unfair. While it's closer to a 50/50 split, I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise. I'm willing to go up to 450,000 for you, but I need to get closer to a 50/50 split.  We're getting closer to the deadline, so let's find a solution that works for both of us.""}
