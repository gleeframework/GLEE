"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $600,000 is now worth less, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

The offer is 300,000 for me and 700,000 for Bob. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the first round as 300,000 / 0.95 = 315,789.47. This is less than my initial offer of 600,000, so I'm not thrilled about this proposal.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, I'll aim to get a larger share this time to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about a fair split. Time to make a stronger move. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll need to be careful with my next move.

To evaluate Bob's offer, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the first round. The money is worth 14.26% less, so I'll divide 450,000 by 0.8587 (1 - 0.1426) to get the equivalent value: 523,151.43. This is actually more than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal considering the decreasing value of money.

I'll reject this offer, but I'll need to think carefully about my next move.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less, I'll aim to get a larger share to make up for it. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging on the value, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split. Accept and we can finish this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of money."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to back down now. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll need to think carefully about my next move.

To evaluate Bob's offer, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the first round. The money is worth 22.62% less, so I'll divide 400,000 by 0.7778 (1 - 0.2262) to get the equivalent value: 514,949.69. This is actually lower than my previous offer, and I'm not sure if it's a good deal considering the decreasing value of money.

I'll reject this offer, but I'll need to be more aggressive in my next move.

# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll need to think carefully about my next move.

To evaluate Bob's offer, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the first round. The money is worth 30.17% less, so I'll divide 250,000 by 0.6979 (1 - 0.3017) to get the equivalent value: 358,441.93. This is a very low offer, considering the decreasing value of money.

To evaluate Bob's offer, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the first round. The money is worth 36.98% less, so I'll divide 150,000 by 0.6362 (1 - 0.3648) to get the equivalent value: 235,579.49. This is an extremely low offer, and I'm not willing to accept it.
