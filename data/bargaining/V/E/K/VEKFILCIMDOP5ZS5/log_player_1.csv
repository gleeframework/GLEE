"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:
```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
I'm not willing to give up 10% of my potential gain just yet. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time to make a counteroffer!

Considering the inflation, my offer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52
}
```
I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a fair split, but I'm still not giving up too much."
