Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a slightly unfair but aggressive offer. I want to maximize my share in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to try and get a deal done. While I still want a good share, I'm aware that the money is becoming worth less with each round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is starting to hurt, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the future. 20 dollars is better than nothing!"
