"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount to start with, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept and we can move on to the next round."

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting us!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too aggressive. I'd like to try to negotiate further and get a better deal for myself.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think he's starting too high, and I'd like to try to get a better split. I'll make my next offer in the next round!"

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can agree.""
}

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too skewed towards you. I'd like to try to get a bit more, but I'm not going to give up yet.""
}
```

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a larger share. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a better deal for myself. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I need to be strategic!"
