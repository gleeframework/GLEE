"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script!  I propose a 60-40 split in my favor.  It's only fair, after all, you got the better deal last time. ðŸ˜‰ 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the new proposal, which seems to be a response to my initial offer rather than a genuine attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the changed circumstances and the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll offer 45-55. A bit more generous this time, but still a good deal!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more modest share for myself, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
