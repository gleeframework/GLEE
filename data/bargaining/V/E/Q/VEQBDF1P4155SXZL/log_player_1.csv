"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a greedy strategy in the first round. I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with only $1. This is to see if he's willing to accept a very small amount, or if he's willing to risk it all for a chance to get more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred more, Bob's offer is still quite good.  Accepting ensures I get something, and the inflation risk is too high to risk rejecting and potentially getting nothing."
