"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of 500,000 in this round is actually worth less than my gain of 800,000 in the previous round. I'll reject this offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in this round, considering the cumulative inflation effect:

Initial value: $1,000,000
Round 1: $1,000,000
Round 2: $1,000,000 x 0.95 = $950,000
Round 3: $950,000 x 0.95 = $902,500
Round 4: $902,500 x 0.85 = $768,125

So, my gain of $400,000 in this round is actually worth $768,125. Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer.
