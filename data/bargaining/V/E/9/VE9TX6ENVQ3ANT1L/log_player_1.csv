"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping to get a quick agreement and avoid the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'm not as eager to accept a 30/70 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, hoping he'll accept this deal before the value of the money drops further."
