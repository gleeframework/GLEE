I'm going for a high gain for myself in the first round, hoping Bob will accept it. If not, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting 10% less in this round, the offer is still too low. I'll aim for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm aiming for a more balanced split this round, considering the inflation. I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is still a significant amount, but also gives me a larger share."
