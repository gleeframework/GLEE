"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20 bucks to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is a relatively generous start. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if you'll take it 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 60 is actually worth 48 (60 * 0.8) in the new round.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 38.4 (48 * 0.8) in the new round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 and end this 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 50 is actually worth 26 (50 * 0.52) in the new round.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Splitting it 50/50 seems like a fair deal, and I'd rather end the game now than risk getting a worse offer in the next round."
