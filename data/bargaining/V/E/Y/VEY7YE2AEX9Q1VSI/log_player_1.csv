Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. This is the fairest option, given the inflation risk, and it allows us both to maximize our potential gains.
