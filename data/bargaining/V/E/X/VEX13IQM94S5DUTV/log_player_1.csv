I propose taking 9000$ and leaving Bob with 1000$. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant share while still giving Bob something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject his offer and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm going to try to be a bit more reasonable this time, but still aim for a larger share. I'll offer Bob 4000, which is a good chunk of money even after the inflation. Hopefully, he'll see it's a better deal than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to a more reasonable offer, it's still not fair. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  We're running out of time, and this money is losing value fast, so I need to be strategic."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're getting close to the end of our rounds and the money is becoming worthless! I'm going to propose an even split of 5000 for each of us. Hopefully, Bob realizes it's in his best interest to accept, since we're both going to be losing a lot of money with every passing round."
