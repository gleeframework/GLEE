"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

I propose to keep 95 dollars for myself, and give Bob 5 dollars. This is a relatively fair starting point, considering the inflation risk. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's in his best interest to get something rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option considering the inflation.  My share is significantly lower, but it's still better than getting nothing if we continue and the money further depreciates."
