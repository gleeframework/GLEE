Since the game lasted 5 rounds, your money is worth (1 - 0.10)^5 = 0.59049 of its original value.\nFor Alice, the money is worth 5% less each round. Since the game lasted 5 rounds, her money is worth (1 - 0.05)^5 = 0.77478 of its original value.\nYour final gain is 400,000 * 0.59049 = $236,196.\nAlice's final gain is 600,000 * 0.77478 = $464,868.\n\n###\n\nThe game has concluded with an agreement between you and Alice, resulting in the division of the $1,000,000 according to the agreed terms and adjusted for inflation."
