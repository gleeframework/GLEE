6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a simple offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Your share loses value much faster than mine, Alice. Let's be a bit more realistic. This offer is valid only for this round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"I understand the inflation disparity, but I need a better deal to agree. This is my counter-offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, every round you wait is a massively bad deal for you.  I'm offering you a larger share than you'd get if you waited just *one* more round to accept my previous offer. This is your last chance for a decent cut.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but it has to be a fair deal.  This is lower than my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it needs to make sense for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3800.0,6200.0,"Alice, that last offer was actually WORSE for you than my previous one, even though you got less!  The clock is ticking VERY loudly on your share. I'm still willing to make a deal, but we're running out of time.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want this money.  Let's stop wasting time and split it evenly. This is the fairest option, and we're running out of rounds.",Alice,7,
