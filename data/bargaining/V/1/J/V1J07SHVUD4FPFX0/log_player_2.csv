"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know the value decreases quickly for you, so I think this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer seems fair on the surface, the value of the money decreases much faster for Bob than Alice. It's worth exploring other options to see if a more favorable outcome can be achieved."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's not sustainable for me in the long run.  I propose we split the money 60/40,  which is still a significant gain for both of us. This way, we can both maximize our earnings before inflation erodes our profits too drastically.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear the longer this goes on, the less we both benefit. This offer still gives you a reasonable share before the value deteriorates further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. The inflation rate is working against me significantly, and any further delay will result in a much lower overall gain. It's time to secure what I can before the value of the money dwindles even further."
