"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly higher share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to be more cautious about accepting a lower share.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better share. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being quite stubborn!

Considering the inflation effect, I need to be careful about accepting a lower share. However, since Bob is meeting me halfway, I'll consider it a reasonable compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
