Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again.  5800 for me and 4200 for you.  This factors in the inflation a bit more while still being a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
