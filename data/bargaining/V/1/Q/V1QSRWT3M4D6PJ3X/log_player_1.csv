Bob's offer:

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The money is losing value quickly, especially for Bob. This makes him more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on. However, the longer we wait, the less appealing even a 50/50 split becomes for us both.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 8 rounds remaining, the pressure is on. If we continue to reject offers, we risk reaching a point where Bob becomes increasingly desperate, potentially leading to less rational offers. 
* **Guaranteed Return:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable return. While I could aim for a higher share, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and we risk walking away with nothing. 

It's a tough decision, but in this scenario, accepting the 50/50 split minimizes risk and secures a decent payout considering the circumstances."
