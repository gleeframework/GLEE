Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The rate of inflation is hitting you harder than me, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be more equitable. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still not fair, especially considering the increasing inflation affecting my gains more heavily. I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
