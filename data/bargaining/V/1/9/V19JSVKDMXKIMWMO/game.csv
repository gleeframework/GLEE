40.0,60.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me taking slightly more since I'm the one making the offer. Let's reach a deal and avoid further inflation!",Bob,2,

45.0,55.0,"Let's meet in the middle. 55/45 is a good compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money.  It's better than losing even more by continuing to play this game.",Bob,4,
