"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can negotiate further if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round (95% * 0.95), I'll make a new offer.

Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's see if you agree.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 500, hoping to get a better deal this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up more than 5500. You can try to do better than 4500. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 85.75% of what it was in the first round (90.25% * 0.95), I'll reassess the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer this time. It's a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise considering the previous offers."
