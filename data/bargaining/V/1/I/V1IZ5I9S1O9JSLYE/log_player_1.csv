"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 55/45 in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation risk, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
