"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll get a chance to even the score later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives me only 10% of the total amount, which is not satisfactory. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round, hoping to get a more favorable offer.\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice. I'm looking forward to her next proposal.\n\n###"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's be realistic.  This is a better deal for you than the last round.  We both need to find a way to get something before the inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial proposal, I still think I can negotiate for a more favorable deal. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round, hoping to get an even better offer.\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice. I'm looking forward to her next proposal or making a new offer myself.\n\n###"

I think this is a fair deal, given the circumstances.""}\n\nI've made an offer that gives me 55% of the total amount, taking into account the increasing risk of inflation, which affects me but not Alice. I'm hoping this proposal will be more acceptable to her, as we both need to find a mutually beneficial agreement before the inflation further devalues my potential gain.\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice.\n\n###"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  This is a good deal for you considering the current situation.  Let's not let it all go to waste. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite the increasing pressure of inflation, I'm not convinced that Alice's offer is the best deal I can get. With the money being worth 34.39% less for me than in the first round, I need to carefully consider my options. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round, hoping to negotiate a more favorable agreement or make a new offer that better suits my needs.\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice. I'm looking forward to her next proposal or making a new offer myself.\n\n###"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. With the inflation affecting me, I think this is a fair compromise. We both get an equal share, and we can both walk away with something.""}\n\nI've made an offer that gives us both 50% of the total amount. Considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I believe this is a reasonable proposal. I'm hoping Alice will see the fairness in this offer and accept it, allowing us to conclude the game with a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice.\n\n###"
