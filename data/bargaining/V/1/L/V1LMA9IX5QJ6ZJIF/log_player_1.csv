I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, Bob will likely reject it, but it's a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split this time. It's a fair offer, and I think it's likely that Bob will accept it."
