"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm sure Bob will try to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, taking into account the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, Bob's offer is actually a good one for me, since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
