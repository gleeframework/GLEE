"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 700k and you can take 300k. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my fair offer, now I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting him to try to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject this offer as well, since it's not a good deal for me. The money I'll gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, and Bob is trying to take 80% of the remaining amount, which is not fair.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% of the remaining amount. It's a fair compromise, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to lowball me, but I'm not falling for it. I'll take a larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation again. However, this time, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease. Considering this, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer, as it's still not a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth even less for me due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. I'll give you 51% of the remaining amount. It's a fair split, considering the current value of the money.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can smell it. I'll take the majority, and you can have the scraps. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation. However, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the significant decrease in value of the money I gain due to inflation, I'll have to be realistic about the amount I can accept. While 150,000 is a relatively small amount, it's still better than getting nothing.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point.
