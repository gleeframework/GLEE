"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This seems like a reasonable starting point. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a ""fair"" starting point, I'm confident I can do better given the inflation factor. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split, considering the money loses value each round. Let's start with a bit more for me, and we'll see where we go from there.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and the value decreases with each round, especially for you. This offer is fair and ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I believe I can still get a better deal, especially since the value of the money continues to decrease for me with each passing round.  I'm going to hold out and see if I can get Alice to budge a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's be practical - I'm offering you a fair split, and it's time to move towards an agreement.  If we keep going back and forth, we risk getting nothing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The longer we wait, the more we both lose. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Alice's offer. While the inflation is hurting me, the longer we wait, the less both of us will get. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and it's time to end this negotiation."
