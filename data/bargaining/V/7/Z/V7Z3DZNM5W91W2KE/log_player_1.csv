"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $64 (80 x 0.8) and Bob would be getting $18 (20 x 0.9).

Considering the drastic change in the ratio, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, my offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

This way, I'm aiming for a more balanced split, but still trying to secure a decent share for myself."
