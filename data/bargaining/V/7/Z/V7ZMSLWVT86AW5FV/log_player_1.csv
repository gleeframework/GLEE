"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob will take it. If he rejects it, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to pull a fast one!  He's offering me a meager $1000, while pocketing $9000. I'm not going to accept that.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm dropping my share a little bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping the majority for myself. I want to see if Bob will accept a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take the lion's share, and the inflation is starting to really hurt. I'm not giving in yet. I'll make another counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

Inflation is getting serious now. I'm willing to go down to $7000, but I'm not giving up much more. I'm hoping Bob realizes we both need to compromise to get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the better end of the deal, and inflation is making this game even more difficult. I'm still not giving in, and I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still holding out for a decent share.  I'm dropping my offer to $6000, hoping Bob realizes we're getting closer to a compromise.  If this gets rejected, we're going to be in serious trouble with how quickly the money is losing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the better end of the deal, even though inflation is making the money we're both getting worthless. I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round. This is getting risky, though."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're running out of time and the inflation is really starting to hurt.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  It's not ideal, but with only 3 rounds left, we need to settle this."
