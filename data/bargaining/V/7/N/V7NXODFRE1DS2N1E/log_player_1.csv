"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but willing to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%. The message is a friendly way of saying that I'm making a strong opening offer, but I'm open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $60 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $57.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
