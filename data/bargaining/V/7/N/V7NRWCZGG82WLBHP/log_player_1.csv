"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a pretty standard starting offer.  I'm aiming for a good amount for myself while leaving a small amount for Bob to hopefully incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is fair, and while I'm not getting the majority of the money, it's better than waiting for another round and potentially getting less due to Bob's decreasing value of the money."
