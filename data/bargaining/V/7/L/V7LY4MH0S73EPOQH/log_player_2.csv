Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to budge a bit, but 60/40 is too lopsided. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share. Remember, the value keeps decreasing for me with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
