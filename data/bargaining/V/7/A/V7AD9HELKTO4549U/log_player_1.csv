"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'd rather get a larger share now. I accept Bob's offer.
