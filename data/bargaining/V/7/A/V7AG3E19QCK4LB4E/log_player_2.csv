I'm going to try to get a better deal. Let's see what Alice counters with!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair, considering I'm the one proposing now.  Let's see if we can agree on this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial proposal 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While a 50/50 split would be ideal, considering Alice's counter-offer and the inflation factor, I think this is a good deal."
