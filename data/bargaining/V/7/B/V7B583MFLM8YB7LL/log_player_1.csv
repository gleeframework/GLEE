Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more even split. I'll take $6000 and you get $4000. This is a fair deal considering we both have to deal with the effects of inflation in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
