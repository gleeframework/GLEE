# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Time to be realistic 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While my potential gains are diminishing, hers are not.  I need to hold out for a better deal, but I need to be mindful that the clock is ticking.  A deal below 50% for me is unacceptable at this point."

**Reasoning:**

This is getting dangerous, but Alice is getting too greedy. Accepting 35% would be a huge loss. I need to hold out a little longer and hope she panics as the deadline approaches."

This is a devastating outcome, but I have no choice. Alice has played a ruthless game, and I've run out of time. Accepting 30% is far better than getting nothing in the final round.  I underestimated her willingness to push this to the brink."
