"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 80% of the original $4000 (since 20% less than $5000 is $4000), which is $3200.

I'm not convinced that an even split is fair, considering the original proposal was $8000 for me and $2000 for Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
