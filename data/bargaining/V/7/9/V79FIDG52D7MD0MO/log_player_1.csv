"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 30 is actually worth 24 (30 * 0.8) and Bob's gain of 70 is worth 63 (70 * 0.9).

I'm not sure if I want to accept a deal that gives me less than 50% of the total. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 45 is worth 45 * 0.5162 = 23.22 (48.8% less than the original 100)
Bob's gain of 55 is worth 55 * 0.7273 = 39.95 (27.1% less than the original 100)

Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if this offer is significantly better than my previous one. However, it's still a 45-55 split, which is closer to my original 60-40 offer. I'll accept this offer.
