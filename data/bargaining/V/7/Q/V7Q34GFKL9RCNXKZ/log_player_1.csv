"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small taste of the pie, but I'll get the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. The message is a friendly gesture to start the game, but don't be fooled â€“ I'm aiming to get the best deal I can!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced distribution. We each receive half of the amount, aiming for fairness. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than before. Considering Bob's proposal, I'd be getting $6,000, which is a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's enough considering the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy, Bob. I'll give you a small slice, but I'm taking the majority.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split, aiming for mutual benefit and fairness. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth a significant 48.8% less than before. Considering Bob's proposal, I'd be getting $5,000, which is a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can do.

However, I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. An equal split might be a good option to consider.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer and split the remaining money equally with Bob. It's not the most optimal outcome, but it's better than risking getting nothing."
