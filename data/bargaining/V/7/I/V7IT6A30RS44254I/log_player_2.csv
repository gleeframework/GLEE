"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money 6000 for me and 4000 for you in the first round. Let's make the most of our shares while the value is still relatively high. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this is a decent starting offer, Bob has 12 rounds to negotiate. He can potentially get a better deal by holding out and seeing if Alice is willing to offer more in the next round. The risk of inflation is real, but the potential for a higher gain is also significant."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 5500/4500 split.  I believe this is a fairer distribution considering the potential for inflation in the coming rounds.""}
