"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, let's split this nearly evenly, but slightly in my favor. This ensures we both benefit immediately rather than risking losing it all through drawn-out negotiations.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way, we both get an equal share and can avoid further negotiations that would only decrease the value of our gains due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
