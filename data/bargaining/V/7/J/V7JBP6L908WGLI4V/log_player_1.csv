"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch it up this time, 60-40 in my favor! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $3200.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
