"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob will get 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we're both taking a risk here. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $360,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $480,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to accept it to get a share of the money. I'll take Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
