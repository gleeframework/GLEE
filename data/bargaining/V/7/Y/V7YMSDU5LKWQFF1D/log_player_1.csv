"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that suggests this is a fair division. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering him a bit less than half, while still appearing reasonable. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait for a better offer. Bob's offer of an even split is more generous than my initial offer, but I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering that the value of the money decreases for Bob with each round. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince Bob offered an even split in the previous round, I know he's willing to give me at least 50%. Considering the money is worth 5% less for him in each round, I'll try to take advantage of this by offering him a bit less than 50% this time. I'll offer 55% for myself and 45% for Bob, with a message that still sounds reasonable.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob reacts!"
