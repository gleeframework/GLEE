"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a little something too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for Bob, he's offering me $70 and keeping $30. This is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I'm getting a bit greedy now!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60, but I'm still leaving Bob with 40. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With Bob's offer, I'd be getting $75, which is a significant amount. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll think about it for a moment...

Actually, I'll accept this offer. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with Bob.
