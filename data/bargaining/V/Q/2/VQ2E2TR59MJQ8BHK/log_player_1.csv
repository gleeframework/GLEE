"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

My gain of 500,000 is worth 90% of its original value (100% - 10% inflation), so it's actually 450,000 in real value.

Bob's gain of 500,000 is worth 95% of its original value (100% - 5% inflation), so it's actually 475,000 in real value.

I'm not sure if I'm better off accepting this offer or waiting for the next round. I'll reject the offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of the gains considering the inflation.

My gain of 550,000 is worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1% inflation), so it's actually 397,500 in real value.

Bob's gain of 450,000 is worth 85.74% of its original value (100% - 14.26% inflation), so it's actually 384,630 in real value.

I'm not sure if I'm better off accepting this offer or waiting for the next round. However, considering the small difference in real value, I'll accept this offer.
