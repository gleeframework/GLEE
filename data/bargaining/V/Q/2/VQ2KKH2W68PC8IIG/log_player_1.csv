Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as the first proposer I want to maximize my gains.  Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, given the inflation and that I'm the one who will get to make the offer next round, I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy as the first round, but adjusting for the inflation.  I'll offer a 80/20 split in my favor, hoping that Bob will see it as more advantageous than getting nothing in the next round."
