"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90$ and Bob gets 10$. The message is just a friendly hello to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after the first round, my gain is now 90 * 0.9 = 81$ and Bob's gain is 10 * 0.95 = 9.5$.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain is now 81 * 0.9 = 72.9$. Bob's gain is 9.5 * 0.95 = 9.025$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70$ and Bob gets 30$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much ground! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the current values of the money:

My gain is 72.9 * 0.729 = 53.0451$ (10% less than the previous round)
Bob's gain is 9.025 * 0.855 = 7.71125$ (5% less than the previous round)

Now, considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain is now 72.9 * 0.271 = 19.7321$ (27.1% less than the first round).
However, I'll use the previous value of 53.0451$ for my gain, as it's the one relevant for this round.

Bob's gain is 7.71125 * 0.855 = 6.5972$ (14.26% less than the first round).
However, I'll use the previous value of 9.025$ for Bob's gain, as it's the one relevant for this round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept this fair offer."
