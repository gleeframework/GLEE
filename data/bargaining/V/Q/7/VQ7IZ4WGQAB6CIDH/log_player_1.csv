"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money worth 20% less, $100,000 is only worth $80,000 in real terms. I'm not sure if I want to settle for that.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the offer, I'll calculate the real value of the money in the first round, which is $1,000,000. The money I would gain in this round is $300,000, which is worth 51.2% of the original amount. That's a relatively small fraction, but it's better than the 20% I would get if I wait another round.

I'll accept the offer.
