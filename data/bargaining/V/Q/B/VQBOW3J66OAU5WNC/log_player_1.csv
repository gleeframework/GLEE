I'm going to try and get a good chunk of the money in the first round, as inflation will eat away at it quickly. I'll offer Bob a small share, but it's better than nothing if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, this offer is a fair split in the current circumstances. Inflation is a real threat, and it's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting less in future rounds."
