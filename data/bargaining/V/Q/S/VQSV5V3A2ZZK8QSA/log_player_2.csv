"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 70/30. I think it's fair considering the inflation might affect our future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it seems fair now, I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation might affect our future gains. Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 54/46 split. This keeps our gains close to the original value, despite the decrease in purchasing power. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'm accepting this offer. While I still think I could get a better deal, the inflation is making the money worth less with each round. It's better to secure some gain now than risk getting nothing later."
