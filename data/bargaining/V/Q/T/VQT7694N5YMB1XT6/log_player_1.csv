"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

The total amount of money is now 900,000 (1,000,000 * 0.9).

Considering the offer, I would gain 450,000, which is 50% of the current total amount, not the initial amount. I think I can do better than that.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This gives me 70% of the current total amount, which is $900,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! The money is worth 27.1% less than the original amount, so I need to be careful.

The current total amount is $648,900 (900,000 * 0.9 * 0.9714).

Considering the offer, I would gain 400,000, which is 61.8% of the current total amount. I think I can do better than that.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get an even higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This gives me 80% of the current total amount, which is $518,352 (648,900 * 0.9 * 0.9714 * 0.9), and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse and worse! The money is worth 40.95% less than the original amount, so I need to be very careful.

The current total amount is $306,531.18 (648,900 * 0.9 * 0.9714 * 0.9 * 0.9).

Considering the offer, I would gain 300,000, which is 98.1% of the current total amount. That's a very bad deal for me. I think I can do much better than that.
