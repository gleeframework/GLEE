**Reasoning:**  The pressure is on, but Alice is still trying to take a disproportionately large share.  I need to show I'm willing to risk it all to get a fair deal. Another rejection might make her nervous and offer something better in the next round."

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly willing to play hardball, and my negotiating position is eroding rapidly due to the inflation. If I reject this offer, there's a very real chance I'll end up with even less in the remaining rounds. It's a disappointing outcome, but better than walking away with nothing."
