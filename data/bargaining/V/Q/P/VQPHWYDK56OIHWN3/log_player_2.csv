"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a slightly better deal than you'd get in the next round if you reject this offer and propose an even split. 
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob should reject this offer. He can likely get a better deal by proposing an even split in the next round. While Alice's offer is better than a 50/50 split, Bob will lose money due to inflation if he accepts. By rejecting, he can potentially get a larger share of the money in the next round."
