I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation penalty is higher for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer. I'm still in a good position with the higher inflation penalty, and I believe I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to Bob, but still keeping a majority. Since my inflation penalty is higher, I want to try to close the deal before it gets too late."
