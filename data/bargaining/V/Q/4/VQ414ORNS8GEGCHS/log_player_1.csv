  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly.""

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward division. Let's see if Bob accepts!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is being a bit greedy, isn't he?

I'll think about it for a moment... Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to weigh my options carefully.

After considering the offer, I'll...

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I have to consider the diminishing returns.

I'll think about it for a moment... With the money being worth so much less, I'm starting to feel the pinch. But I'm not ready to give up yet.

  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing me to the limit, but I'll give you a slightly bigger share.""

# Bob's message: You're being too weak, I'll take almost everything now 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value! Bob's offer is extremely one-sided, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.

I'll think about it for a moment... With the money being worth so little, I'm not sure I can afford to be too picky. But I'm not ready to give up yet.

  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're desperate, I'll take almost everything now 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! Bob's offer is laughable, and I'm starting to feel desperate. But I'm not ready to give up yet.

However, with the money being worth so little, I have to consider the fact that 1000 dollars is a significant amount to me now. It's not just about the money, it's about the principle of the game.

I'll think about it for a moment... And I'll make a decision.
