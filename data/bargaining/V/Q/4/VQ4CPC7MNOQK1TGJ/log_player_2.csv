Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer or the whole thing will evaporate soon. It's time to be pragmatic. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000

This is a tough one, but time is working heavily against me. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer ensures I get something substantial before inflation eats away at the value. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Severe Depreciation:** At a 59.04% decrease, my potential earnings are plummeting rapidly with each round. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Her offers have been consistently in the 60/40 split range. It's unlikely she'll budge much more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Waiting for a slightly better offer in the next round is too risky. The potential loss from depreciation outweighs the potential gain."
