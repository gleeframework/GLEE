Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting, but it's still heavily skewed in his favor. Let's analyze:

**Current Round:**

* **My potential gain:** $400,000
* **My potential gain if I wait and propose in Round 3:**  $650,000 * 0.8 (20% inflation) = $520,000

Even with inflation, waiting one more round and proposing my original offer (which Bob is likely to find more agreeable in later rounds) will net me more.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out!  Let's make a deal, this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer:

**Current Situation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $450,000
* **Potential Gain if I wait and propose in Round 5:** $600,000 * 0.8 (20% inflation) = $480,000 

**Considerations:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 8 rounds left, the pressure is on.  
* **Bob's Stance:**  Calling it his ""final offer"" might be a bluff, but it could also mean he's unwilling to budge further.
* **Inflation:** While my ideal offer diminishes each round, so does Bob's gain from being stubborn. 

**Decision:**

This is a close call. Bob's offer is getting closer to a fairer split, and the time pressure is real. However, I still believe I have a chance of securing a slightly better deal in the next round or two.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  This is a compromise to end this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's crunch time! Let's break this down:

**Current Situation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $475,000
* **Potential Gain if I wait and propose in Round 7:** $550,000 * 0.8 (20% inflation) = $440,000

**Considerations:**

* **Downward Trend:** My potential gain from waiting is now **less** than Bob's current offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  We only have 6 rounds left. The risk of walking away with nothing is very real.
* **Bob's Tone:** Bob is clearly trying to compromise now. He knows we're both losing out.

**Decision:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is now the more logical choice. The risk of losing everything outweighs a potentially slightly better offer that might not even be accepted.
