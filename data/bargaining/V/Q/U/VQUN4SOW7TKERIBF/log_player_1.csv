"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going for a very high initial offer for myself.  While Bob gets a small amount, I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept in the hopes of getting more in later rounds. Since the money is worth less to him in later rounds, he might be happy to take what he can now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I proposed in the first round, and I know that he's losing money with each passing round. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I continue to reject his offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping it high. Bob's offer was very low, and I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give in to his demands.  He's losing money more quickly than I am, so he has a stronger incentive to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm losing nothing by rejecting it, and he's losing a significant amount of money with each passing round.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep playing."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still keeping a large portion of the money for myself.  Bob is losing a lot of money with each passing round, so I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept a smaller portion now than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still keeping a majority of the money. Bob's offer was getting closer, but he's losing money rapidly.  He's likely getting desperate, so I'm hoping he'll see that this is a better deal than risking getting nothing at all."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still keeping a significant portion of the money.  Bob is losing a lot of money with each passing round, so I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept a smaller portion now than risk getting nothing at all.  We are getting close to the end of the game, and the stakes are getting higher for both of us."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000} 
```

We're down to the wire, and I need to make a strong offer.  I'm reducing my share to 550,000, which is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that getting something is better than getting nothing.  With only two rounds left, the pressure is high, and I'm taking a chance on him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 737856 
# Bob gain: 262144 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is it!  We're down to the last round.  Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'd hoped for, but he's losing so much money with each round that it's unlikely he'll offer more.  While I'm disappointed I didn't get more, I'm better off taking what I can than risking getting nothing at all.  I accept his offer."
