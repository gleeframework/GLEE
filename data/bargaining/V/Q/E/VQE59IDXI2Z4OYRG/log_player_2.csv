Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Since my share isn't affected by inflation, I'm taking a bit more. It's still better for you to accept now, as your share will be worth even less next round. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm increasing my share again, as the inflation is only affecting your side. It's getting less worthwhile for you to delay, so I'm hoping we can settle now. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70

``` 
It's getting increasingly worse for me with each round due to inflation, so it's better to accept this offer than to risk getting even less in the next round."
