Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle-ish 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The impact of inflation is becoming more significant, but holding out for a better deal is still the stronger move."

# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a tough game, but her offer is still not good, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gains. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even with the risk of getting nothing."

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The relentless march of inflation is killing us. While this offer is still far from ideal, it's the best we're likely to get from Alice. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
