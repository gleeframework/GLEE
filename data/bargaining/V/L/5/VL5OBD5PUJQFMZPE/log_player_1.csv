Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60-40 split. How about 65-35? It's still fair, but gives me a bit more for taking the lead in this round. 
# Alice gain: 35

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 58-42 split, especially with inflation in mind. Let's try 68-32. It's a good compromise, and we can both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 32 
# Bob gain: 68 
Do you accept this offer?","### Decision\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### Reasoning\nWith the money being worth 48.8% less for me in this round, I would only get 0.512 * 32 = 16.384 dollars in value. I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round, so I will reject this offer.\n\n### Next Offer\n{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, 56-44 seems like a fairer split to account for the loss in value.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more to end this quickly.  How about 72-28?  We've both had our chances to make proposals, and the inflation is only going to hurt us more. 
# Alice gain: 28 
# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","### Decision\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### Reasoning\nWith the money being worth 67.23% less for me in this round, I would only get 0.3277 * 28 = 9.1766 dollars in value. Given the significant loss in value due to inflation, I still think it's worth trying to negotiate for a slightly better deal in the next round, despite the risk of further inflation.\n\n### Next Offer\n{""alice_gain"": 54, ""bob_gain"": 46, ""message"": ""Given the extreme inflation, a 54-46 split is more reasonable to compensate for my loss in value.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting tired of this back and forth.  I'm going to make one final offer.  75-25 is my last attempt to come to an agreement.  It's still a fair split, considering the inflation has significantly impacted the value of your share.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","### Decision\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### Reasoning\nWith the money being worth 79.03% less for me in this round, I would only get 0.2097 * 25 = 5.2425 dollars in value if I accept this offer. However, considering the extreme loss in value due to inflation and Bob's statement that this is his final offer, I believe the risk of not getting a better deal in the next rounds is too high. Accepting this offer, despite the low value, seems like the best option to ensure I get something rather than risking getting nothing if the game ends without an agreement.\n\n### Conclusion\nI accept Bob's offer of a 75-25 split, acknowledging that the inflation has significantly impacted the value of my share, but prioritizing getting some value over the risk of ending up with nothing."
