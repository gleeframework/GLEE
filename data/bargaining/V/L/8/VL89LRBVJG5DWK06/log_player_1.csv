"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly!""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, with a message encouraging fairness in our negotiation. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because I initially offered a better split for myself, and considering the inflation, accepting 40% now would be even less valuable than before. It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a slight adjustment from my initial proposal, taking into account the inflation. By offering $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground while still considering the value decrease due to inflation. Your turn!"
