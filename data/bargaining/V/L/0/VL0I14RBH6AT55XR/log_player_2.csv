"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take most of the money now, but you'll get a chance to make a better offer next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's better to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  Since the money is worth more to me than to Alice, it's in my best interest to see if I can get a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more evenly this time. I'm willing to compromise, and we both get a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need a decent share.  Let's try to find a compromise this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than her previous one, but I still think I can get a bigger share. Since my gains are not affected by inflation, I'll continue to negotiate for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm increasing my offer again.  It's time to find a compromise that benefits us both. This offer is fair, and we can both walk away happy.""}
