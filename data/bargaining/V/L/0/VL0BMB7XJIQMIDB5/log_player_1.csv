I'm going for a strong opening offer. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm giving Bob a small amount to make it tempting.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, but I'm not going to give in so easily. My share would be worth a lot less in the next round, so I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try and stay firm on my end, but I'll raise Bob's share a bit to see if he's willing to compromise. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still hoping for a good deal."
