Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair starting point given the round structure. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a higher percentage, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Bob is getting less from this deal due to inflation, and there's no guarantee he'll offer me a better deal in the next round. It's better to take what I can get and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
