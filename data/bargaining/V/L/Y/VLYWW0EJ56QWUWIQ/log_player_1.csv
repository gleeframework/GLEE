"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer. Since I get to propose first, I'll take the majority share, leaving Bob with a smaller amount.  We'll see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, taking a 70% share is better than the 10% share I would have gotten if I rejected Bob's offer and went to round 3. With inflation, I would be losing more money."
