"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I think I deserve more for being the first to propose.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't just get a free ride, I'm taking a fair share now 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my thinking.

Considering the offer, I'll have to accept a smaller share, but I still want to get a decent amount. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
