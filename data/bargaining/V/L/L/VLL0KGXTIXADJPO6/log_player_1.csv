Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer.  Since I don't know how inflation impacts Bob, I'm assuming it's the same for both of us. This way, if Bob rejects, he'll have to offer me something significantly better in the next round.  Let's see how greedy Bob is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is much fairer than my initial proposal, especially given the inflation factor. Accepting this means we both get a significant amount of money, and there's no risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
