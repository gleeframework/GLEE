"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems a bit lopsided in Bob's favor. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the next round of inflation, my gain will be worth 64% of what it was in the first round, and I need to make a new offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous this time, but still holding out for a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. I'm getting closer to the middle ground. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential gains!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I did in the previous round, but I'm trying to be reasonable. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can get a better deal in the next round.
