"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a 60-40 split in my favor.  Let's be efficient and finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split in my favor, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation.
