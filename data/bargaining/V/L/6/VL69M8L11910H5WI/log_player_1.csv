"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a chance on a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my gain. However, I'm not thrilled about Bob getting $6,000, which is a significant advantage.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, let's try again!""}

I'm proposing a slight adjustment, giving me a slightly larger share of the $10,000, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant drop in value of Bob's gain due to inflation, I'm not too concerned about the absolute numbers. However, I'm still trying to maximize my own gain.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

Hmm... 5800 for me is a decent offer, but I was hoping for a bit more. On the other hand, 4200 for Bob is still a relatively small share.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's a good compromise.
