"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, let's start with a fair split! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a good starting point for negotiation.  I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be practical. I'm taking a larger share, but this is still a win-win situation. Let's finish this."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. But let's compromise.  I'm willing to take a smaller cut this round, but let's end this before the inflation eats away too much of our potential. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is fair considering the inflation. Accepting now ensures a decent return before the money depreciates further."
