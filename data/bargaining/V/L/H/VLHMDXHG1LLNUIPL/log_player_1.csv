"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal.  I'm willing to take 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%.  This should be attractive to him, especially since he's only losing 10% of the value with each round.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While 300,000 is a substantial amount, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic decrease in my share, especially considering I'm losing value faster than Bob. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. While this is still a significant reduction from my initial offer, I believe it's fair given the inflation and Bob's increasing share. I'm hoping he'll see the value in reaching an agreement quickly before the money depreciates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While his proposal is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still not fair given the rapid inflation affecting me. I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  We are both losing significant value with each round, so it's time to compromise.  I believe this is a fair offer, given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I recognize we're both losing a substantial amount of money with each round, his proposal is not fair.  I'm losing value at a much faster rate, and I'm determined to secure a more equitable split.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits us both in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split.  We are both losing value rapidly and the risk of getting nothing is high.  This is my final offer.  I hope Bob will recognize the need for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Even though the money is losing value rapidly, I still believe that I can get a better deal. Bob is losing less value with each round, so it's important for me to hold out for a more equitable split.  I'm not giving up hope yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

We're getting close to the end, and the risk of getting nothing is high. This is my final offer. It's a 40/60 split, which is a compromise considering the inflation.  I hope Bob will see the value in ending this game and sharing the remaining value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I recognize we are approaching the end of the game, his proposal is still not acceptable. I'm losing a significantly larger proportion of my money due to inflation, and I am determined to hold out for a fairer split.  I still believe there is a chance we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000}
```

We're at the eleventh hour, and both of us are losing a lot of value. This is my final offer.  It's a 35/65 split in Bob's favor, recognizing the higher inflation rate I am facing. I hope Bob will see the value in reaching a compromise before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but I have to accept Bob's offer.  The money is losing value so rapidly that I'm better off taking what I can get.  It's a shame we couldn't reach a more equitable agreement, but I'm glad we at least avoided getting nothing."
