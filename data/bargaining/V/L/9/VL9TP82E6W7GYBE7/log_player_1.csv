"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 600,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 300,000 is now worth 95% of 300,000, which is 285,000, and Bob's gain of 700,000 is now worth 80% of 700,000, which is 560,000.

I accept this offer.
