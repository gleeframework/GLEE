"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. It's a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept a 40/60 split, especially considering the inflation will be much harsher on Alice in the future. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation rates.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my 58% is actually worth less than before. Let's compromise, I'll take 58% and you can have 42%. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice is getting more aggressive. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, and I can afford to wait another round given the inflation is hitting Alice harder."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""We're both losing money with each round. Let's be more reasonable. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. This will ensure we both get something, and it's a fairer split given the inflation impact.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're both losing, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet halfway between our last offers. I'll take 56% and you can have 44%. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I am losing a significant amount of money with each round. Given Alice's current offer and the increasing inflation, I believe it is best to accept and secure some of the remaining value."
