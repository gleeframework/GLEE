"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting too high, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob's offer is a significant reduction from my initial proposal, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept it. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting $900,000, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less than my initial offer, so he's getting $700,000 instead of $1,000,000.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a significant reduction, I'll try to meet him halfway, but with a slight adjustment to account for the inflation. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial proposal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still too high, meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Bob's offer is very close to my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet him in the middle. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting $900,000 in value, but Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than my initial offer, so he's getting $550,000 instead of $1,000,000.

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise.
