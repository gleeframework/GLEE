"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my gain of $200,000 in this round is worth 95% of what it was in the previous round, which is $190,000.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's still a decent deal. I'll accept it.
