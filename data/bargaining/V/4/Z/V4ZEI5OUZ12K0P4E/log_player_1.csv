Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. But I think a 60/40 split, with me getting 60%, is a more fair reflection of our respective bargaining power in this game.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
