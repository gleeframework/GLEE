Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about a 55/45 split? It's still in your favor from the first round, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
