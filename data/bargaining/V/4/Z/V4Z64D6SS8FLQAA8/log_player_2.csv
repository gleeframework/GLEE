"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to accept a seemingly fair split,  we have to consider the game's mechanics. Alice's offer is good for me now, but with each passing round, the money will be worth less for Alice. This gives me leverage to negotiate a better deal in the future.  By rejecting, I force Alice to make a more advantageous offer to get me to accept before the value of the money drops significantly for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the fairness you proposed, but I believe a more balanced split is possible, given the decreasing value of the money for you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than her first, but it still doesn't account for the fact that her money is worth less than mine due to inflation. By rejecting again, I put pressure on her to make a more appealing offer before the value of the money drops even further for her.  I can afford to wait a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""We're both losing money with every passing round.  I believe a split that favors me slightly, given the inflation affecting you, is a more practical solution.  Let's come to an agreement before the situation becomes even less favorable for both of us.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I still want a significant share. Let's end this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to feel the pinch of inflation, and her offer is getting closer to what I'd like. However, I'm still not convinced that she's offered enough to make the deal worthwhile. I can still afford to wait a few more rounds and see if she'll offer something even more beneficial to me.  It's important to remember that the longer we wait, the less the money will be worth for her, giving me more leverage."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we're nearing the end of this game.  Inflation is hurting your share of the money more and more with each round. I believe a split of 70/30,  given the current circumstances,  is the most equitable solution to ensure we both get something before the value of the money dwindles further. Let's end this on a positive note.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a risk, but I still think we can find a better compromise. Inflation is killing me, but I won't give up yet. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still not ideal, but with only 5 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is significant. Her offer gives me a decent share, and the fact that her money is worth significantly less now due to inflation means that any further negotiation might not yield a much better outcome for me.  It's time to take this deal before the money becomes completely worthless."
