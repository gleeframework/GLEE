"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's start with a slightly skewed split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it since it's a better offer than the initial 50/50. I'll accept this proposal.
