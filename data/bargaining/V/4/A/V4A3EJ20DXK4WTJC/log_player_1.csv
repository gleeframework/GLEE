"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $6,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, the new total is $9,500. Bob's offer is still a 50/50 split, but with a slightly lower total.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
