"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd be getting $480,000 (0.8 x $600,000) if I accepted your offer.

I'd like to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a more even split this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
