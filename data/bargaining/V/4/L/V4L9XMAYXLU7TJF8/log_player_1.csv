"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive 800,000 dollars and Bob receives 200,000 dollars. This is a 4:1 ratio, which seems reasonable to me as the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it down the middle.  It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my proposed gain of 500,000 is actually 80% of the original 800,000 I proposed in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Splitting it down the middle seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it 50/50 is the best deal for me. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, my gain is now worth 80% of the 80% of the original 800,000, which is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 or 64% of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```"
