"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is a classic ultimatum game.  I'm proposing to take almost everything, leaving Bob with a tiny amount.  This is likely to be rejected, but it sets the stage for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to play the game, or if he'll fold immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing.  It's time to be pragmatic and accept."
