Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. I'm getting closer to the lower end of the spectrum, and I don't want to get stuck with a really small share.
