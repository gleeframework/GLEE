Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think we should find a middle ground. I'll take 55% and you can have 45%. It's better for both of us to agree now rather than losing more value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
