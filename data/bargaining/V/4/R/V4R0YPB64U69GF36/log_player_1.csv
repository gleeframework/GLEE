"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, Bob's offer is actually a bit more favorable to him now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A 42-58 split seems reasonable, considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, hoping to meet Bob in the middle and end the game."
