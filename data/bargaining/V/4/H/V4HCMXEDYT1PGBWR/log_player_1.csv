"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and leaving $20 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give you a bigger share, but not that big! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to negotiate further, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'm not thrilled about taking only 60% of the remaining value, but I'll consider it a decent compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can finally conclude the game."
