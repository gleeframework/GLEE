"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good foundation""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got 60% of the pie, I'll take 40% 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 40% is a good enough share for me, considering I'm already getting 20% less due to inflation. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I need a bit more""}

I'm willing to give up a bit more to try to reach a deal, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close, I'll give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 30% share I'm being offered, especially considering the inflation is eating away at my gains. I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7250, ""bob_gain"": 2750, ""message"": ""I'll give a bit more, but don't expect much more""}

I'm willing to give up a bit more to try to reach a deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really close, I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think I've been negotiating for long enough, and I'm willing to accept this offer. 68% of the original amount is better than the 67.23% I'd get if I rejected and had to negotiate further. Plus, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal from Bob at this point."
