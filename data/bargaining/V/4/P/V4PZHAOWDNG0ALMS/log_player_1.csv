"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can split the money fairly without further negotiation."
