Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the larger share since I'm losing less to inflation. This is a fair deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
