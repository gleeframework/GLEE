Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to try a more even split this time, offering $800,000 for myself and $200,000 for Bob. I'm hoping that this will be a more appealing offer considering the inflation."

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  While Bob is getting closer to a 50/50 split, inflation is working against me, and I think I can still get a better outcome."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $700,000 for myself and $300,000 for Bob.  I think this is a fair offer, considering the inflation and the fact that we're getting close to the end of the game."

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer.  While it's not the best outcome I was hoping for, inflation has eaten away a significant amount of my potential gain, and it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing at all."
