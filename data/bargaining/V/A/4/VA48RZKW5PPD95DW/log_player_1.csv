"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and taking 60 dollars for myself. I'm hoping that the allure of getting 40 dollars right off the bat will entice Bob to accept my offer, especially since the value of the money will decrease for me in subsequent rounds. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This is a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer of 45 dollars is a decent one, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. Since the value of the money will continue to decrease for me in subsequent rounds, I want to try to negotiate a better deal. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise further in the next round. Plus, I'm not convinced that 45 dollars is the best I can get, especially since I started with a higher offer in the first round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more""}\n\nSince Bob offered me 45 dollars in the previous round, I'm willing to meet him in the middle, but I still want to come out slightly ahead. I'm offering 55 dollars for myself and 45 dollars for Bob, hoping that he'll see this as a reasonable compromise. The fact that the value of the money is decreasing for me with each round adds a sense of urgency to the negotiations, so I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable solution before it's too late!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's split it evenly. 50/50.  Time is running out! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nBob's offer of a 50/50 split is a fair one, and considering the decreasing value of the money for me, it's a good deal. Since we're already in the fourth round, and the value of the money will continue to decrease, I don't want to risk losing more value by rejecting this offer. Accepting this deal ensures that I get at least 50 dollars, which is a reasonable outcome. It's time to wrap up the negotiations and walk away with a decent share!"
