Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, how about we meet closer to the middle?  This round I get a bit more, but it's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 300000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back-and-forth is pointless.  I'm making another concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is a fair offer considering the time crunch. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer isn't terrible, I believe I can push for a better deal in the next couple of rounds. My offers are consistently more reasonable, and the pressure is mounting on Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking! This is a very reasonable offer considering the circumstances. Let's end this now and both walk away with something.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm applying a bit more pressure now. Alice is running out of time, and I want to convey a sense of urgency. My offer is still a significant improvement over her previous one while acknowledging the time constraint we're both facing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out! This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it guarantees you a good chunk of the money. Let's be sensible and close this deal! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds, and if we don't settle now, we risk getting nothing.
* **Inflation:** Inflation is hurting Alice more than me. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this guarantees me a decent amount that won't be affected by further inflation.
* **Unpredictability:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer me a better deal in the remaining rounds. She might get desperate and lowball even further.

It's a tough decision, but sometimes it's better to take a sure thing than risk losing everything."
