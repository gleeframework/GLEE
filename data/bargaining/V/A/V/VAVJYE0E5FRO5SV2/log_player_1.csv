"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep $900,000 for myself and give Bob $100,000. This way, I secure a large portion of the money and still leave a reasonable amount for Bob to consider.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insulting! While I lost some value due to inflation, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided split.  I'll make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the diminishing value of the money. I'm proposing to take $810,000 and give Bob $190,000. This is still a significant amount for me and I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unreasonable. While I've lost a significant portion of value due to inflation, I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me so little. I'll make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of offering a decent chunk of the money to Bob, but I'm also trying to maximize my share. This time, I'm proposing $729,000 for myself and $271,000 for Bob.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer considering the ongoing inflation. Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 271000 
# Bob gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing value rapidly, Bob's offer is still too low.  He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900} 
```

I'm continuing to offer a significant amount to Bob, but I'm also trying to maximize my share in the face of this relentless inflation. This time, I'm proposing $656,100 for myself and $343,900 for Bob. This is still a sizable sum for him and I'm hoping he'll finally see the value in accepting a reasonable offer."
