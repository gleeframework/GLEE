Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. How about a 55/45 split? This seems fairer considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money equally this round.  We both lost some value due to inflation, so a 50/50 split feels more reasonable now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
