# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk to start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with just 10% of the total amount. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, we should be fair to each other.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less with each passing round, I'll try to be more reasonable and offer a closer split, while also considering Alice's initial offer. Hopefully, she'll see the fairness in this proposal and accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worth my while. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Assistant: {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice has increased her offer, considering the inflation and the fact that I offered her a 55% share in the previous round, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than I initially proposed, but I still believe a more even split is fair. Let's end this before the money loses more value.""}\n\nGiven the ongoing inflation, I'm adjusting my offer to be slightly more favorable to Alice while still pushing for a closer split. Hopefully, she'll see the urgency in settling this soon and accept this proposal."
