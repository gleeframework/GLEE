"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'm open to negotiation in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not happy with the offer of $1000, which is only 10% of the total amount. I believe I deserve a more equal share, especially considering the impact of inflation on my potential earnings in future rounds. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more balanced, taking into account the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value over time.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's aim for a more balanced split, considering the impact of inflation on my end. This way, we both get a significant share, and I'm open to further negotiation if needed.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a larger share to make this worth my while. Let's aim for a more equitable split where we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice's offer is an improvement from the initial proposal, I still believe I can negotiate for a better share. The current offer gives me 40% of the total amount, but considering the 9.75% decrease in value due to inflation, I'm effectively getting less than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll continue to push for a more balanced split, taking into account the cumulative effect of inflation on my potential earnings. Since the money is now worth 9.75% less to me, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

{""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I believe this split is more reasonable. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair share given the decreasing value of the money for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to get a larger share to compensate for the time we've wasted. This is my final offer before the inflation hits us both harder. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice frames this as her final offer before the inflation worsens, I'm not convinced that accepting 30% of the original amount is the best decision, especially considering the money is now worth 18.55% less to me. This effectively means I'm getting even less value than the nominal amount suggests. Given the circumstances, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, despite the risk of further inflation impacts."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","As the game progresses, the impact of inflation on my potential earnings becomes more significant. With the money now worth 18.55% less to me, I need to adjust my strategy to ensure I get a fair share. However, I also need to be mindful of the risk that Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and decreased value due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Given the substantial impact of inflation on my end, I believe a 60-40 split is more reasonable at this stage. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a fair share and considering the decreasing value of the money for me. I hope we can settle on this to avoid further losses due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. We're running out of time, and the inflation is only going to get worse. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but we need to agree quickly before both of us lose out. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nDespite Alice's urgency and the significant impact of inflation, accepting an offer of $2000, which is effectively worth even less due to the 26.49% decrease in value, doesn't seem like the best course of action. The difference in the amount I would receive compared to Alice's share is substantial, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more balanced split. However, I must also consider the time constraint and the risk of losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. I'll reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the critical stage of the game and the significant impact of inflation on my potential earnings, I need to make a strategic offer that considers both the urgency of reaching an agreement and the need for a fair share. With the money now worth 26.49% less to me, every dollar counts more than ever.

{""bob_gain"": 6200,
""alice_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""We're running out of time, and the inflation is severely impacting my share. I'm willing to push for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value but still ensure Alice gets a substantial amount. This is a critical moment, and I hope we can agree on this split to avoid further devaluation and the risk of losing everything.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're nearing the end, and the risk of losing everything is real. Let's compromise and split the money 60/40, ensuring we both get something significant before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nAt this stage, considering the significant impact of inflation and the risk of losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the next few rounds, accepting Alice's offer of a 60/40 split seems like the most pragmatic decision. Although the money is worth 33.66% less to me, getting $4000 is better than risking further devaluation or possibly ending up with nothing. This offer is more reasonable than previous ones, given the circumstances, and it's time to secure a deal to ensure I receive a tangible amount."
