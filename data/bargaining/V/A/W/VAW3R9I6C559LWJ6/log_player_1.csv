"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're starting with $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is closer to a fair split, considering inflation will affect my side more than yours. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that this is a fair split, especially since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share""}

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the effects of inflation on Bob's side."
