"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering you $100,000 and keeping the remaining $900,000 for myself. It's a decent starting point, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

Since the money is worth 20% less in this round, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: 100,000 * 0.8 = 80,000
Bob's gain: 900,000 * 0.8 = 720,000

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is still quite generous on Bob's part. I'll accept this offer.
