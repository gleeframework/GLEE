"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you take 30.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I take 70% of the original $100, which is $70, and Bob takes the remaining 30%, which is $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you half, you can't do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the money is now worth 95% of its original value, so the total amount to be divided is $95.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer. I'll accept it.
