"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more for being the better negotiator 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that Bob deserves more for being the better negotiator, and I think he's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you still need to compromise""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. I'm trying to find a middle ground that still favors me slightly, but is more appealing to Bob than his original offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4800, but I think I deserve more for being more patient 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that Bob's patience deserves a bigger share of the pie. I think he's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to him due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving in too much""}

I'm proposing a new offer that's closer to Bob's previous offer, giving him $4,800 and keeping $5,200 for myself. I'm trying to find a compromise that's more appealing to Bob, but still reflects my initial goal of getting a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4600, but I think I deserve more for being the last one to make an offer 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's point about being the last one to make an offer is a fair one, and I'm willing to give him a slightly better deal. I'm not getting a great deal, but I'm willing to accept this offer to end the game and get the remaining money."
