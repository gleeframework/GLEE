"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to consider the relative value of the money. Since Bob's offer is 6000, which is worth 20% less than his initial 6000 in the first round, it's equivalent to 6000 / 0.8 = 7500 in the first round.

In that case, I think I can do better than a 40-60 split. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 40-60, I'll try to tilt the odds in my favor a bit. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round. Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, it's equivalent to 5200 / (1 - 0.488) = 5200 / 0.512 = 10150 in the first round.

In that case, I think this offer is reasonable, and I'll accept it.
