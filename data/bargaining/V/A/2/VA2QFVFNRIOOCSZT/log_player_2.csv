"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 640000, ""alice_gain"": 360000, ""message"": ""My turn to propose a fair deal. This considers the time-value of money.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** Alice's initial offer was generous, but waiting one round allows me to propose a counter-offer that benefits me more while still being appealing to Alice.
* **Proposed Offer:** I'm proposing a slightly better split in my favor (64/36) to account for the 20% inflation.  Alice is still getting a significant sum, and it's in her best interest to accept now before the money is worth even less.
* **Message:** The message aims to frame the offer as fair and logical, considering the game's mechanics."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a better deal for both 
# Bob gain: 568000 
# Alice gain: 432000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The money is losing value quickly. Accepting 568,000 now is better than risking another round and potentially getting an even smaller amount.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice seems to understand the impact of inflation and is making increasingly appealing offers. There's no guarantee she'll be as generous in subsequent rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could gamble on getting a slightly better deal in a later round, the risk of ending up with much less is significant. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonably fair outcome."
