"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less to begin with.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see if he'll accept the proposal and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting our contributions to the game so far. Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 95% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's equivalent to $38.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since I didn't get to make a proposal in this round, I'll have to think carefully about my next move.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that I rejected Bob's previous offer, I'll make a slightly more aggressive proposal this time. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a 60/40 split? I'll give you 45, now it's your turn to be generous!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I think 55/45 is a fair compromise. We can finish this game and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gain!

Considering the offer, I'll calculate my gain in the original amount: $45 / 0.859 (1 - 0.1416) = $52.28. So, in the original amount, I'd be getting around $52.28.

I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm also not eager to continue playing with the inflation eating away at my potential gains. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
