Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a better split that benefits us both.  Let's start by me getting a little more, but still leaving you a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm giving up a significant amount and he's getting a larger share. I'd like to propose a new offer that's more balanced."
