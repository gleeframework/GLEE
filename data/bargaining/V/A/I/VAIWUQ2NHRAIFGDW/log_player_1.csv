"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rate will affect Bob's share more heavily than mine in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred the 60/40 split, the inflation is a significant factor.  A 50/50 split is fair in the current circumstances and I'm willing to accept it."
