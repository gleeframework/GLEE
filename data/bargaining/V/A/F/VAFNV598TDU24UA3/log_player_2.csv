"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I get the lion's share, but you still get a decent amount.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

""bob_gain"": 600000,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a bigger share, but I'm not willing to go below 60%. Let's meet in the middle and split it 60/40. We both get a good amount, and it's fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is fair, and it's better than risking getting nothing."
