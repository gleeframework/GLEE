"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but you'll still get a decent chunk. Consider this a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $2,400 in this offer.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the ratio, though. It seems a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. How about a 42-58 split? It's closer to a fair share, and I'm willing to give you a bigger chunk than before.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
