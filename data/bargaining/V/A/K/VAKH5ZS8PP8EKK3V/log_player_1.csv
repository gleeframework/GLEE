Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share, but I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome this time.   
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's meet in the middle.  This matches the split you proposed last round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is framing this as a generous concession, remember inflation is working against me.  He's content to wait, knowing his offer gets better for him (relatively) each round. I need to push for a more significant advantage while it's still somewhat valuable to me."

Round 5

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm matching your offer from the last round. Let's close this out and avoid losing any more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is getting critical. While Bob is now acknowledging the impact of inflation, his offer is still barely better than taking nothing at this point, given how much value I've lost.  I need to signal I'm willing to accept a less favorable split to avoid disaster, but it has to be significantly better than this."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome now.  Don't let greed make us both lose everything.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a last-ditch effort to salvage something.  I'm proposing an even split, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and the very real risk we both face. It's unlikely I can push for a better deal at this point without him calling my bluff.  He might accept a slightly smaller amount than his desired outcome to avoid getting nothing at all."
