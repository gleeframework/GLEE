"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. It's a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 20% share is a good starting point, there's no reason to accept it on the first round.  By rejecting, I can force Alice to propose a better deal in the next round, especially if she's aware of the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60% is a fairer share for me. I'm willing to give you 40% this round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
