Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer, considering the inflation. Let's start with this, and we can adjust it later if needed. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough decision! Let's analyze:

**Bob's Offer:**

* **My Gain (Alice):** $4000 
* **Bob's Gain:** $6000

**Inflation Impact:**

* My potential earnings decrease by 10% each round.
* Bob's potential earnings decrease by 20% each round.

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor right now, the inflation works strongly in my favor as the rounds progress. 
* Accepting now gives me a guaranteed, though smaller, amount.
* Rejecting means gambling on getting a better offer in later rounds when the value of Bob's share will plummet.

**Decision:** This is a risky game to play.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get him to be more reasonable in a later round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts you more than me. I'm being reasonable, but this won't last forever.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're getting closer to the deadline, and getting zero is a real possibility.
* **Inflation Advantage:** I need to leverage the fact that Bob's potential earnings are decreasing at twice the rate of mine.
* **Firm but Fair:** This offer is still a compromise, but it shows Bob I'm serious about getting a larger share due to the game's mechanics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation, but we both need to compromise. This split is closer to a 50/50, but also considers the impact of inflation on our gains. Let's be reasonable and move forward. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's break it down:

**The Situation:**

* **Time:** Rounds are ticking by, increasing the risk of both of us walking away with nothing.
* **My Value (Alice):**  The money I get is worth  ~27% less than at the start.
* **Bob's Value (Bob):**  The money he gets is worth ~49% less than at the start. 
* **Bob's Offer:** He's offering slightly more than his last offer (which heavily favored him), but it's still a worse deal for me than my previous offer.

**Analysis:**

* Bob is SLOWLY moving towards a fairer split, but he's likely hoping I'll panic as we get closer to the final rounds.
* The inflation IS working in my favor. Every round his offer is worth less to him.

**Decision:**

I need to call his bluff, but not be unreasonable. I'll reject again, but in the next round, I'm going to significantly decrease my demands to make it clear I'm willing to compromise but not be taken advantage of.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer - let's close this deal and walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  I'm injecting a sense of urgency. This isn't a bluff â€“ I'm truly willing to accept this to avoid disaster.
* **Concession:**  I've lowered my ask considerably. It's not about winning anymore, it's about ensuring we both benefit. 
* **Finality:** The ""final offer"" signals I'm done negotiating. Bob needs to realize we're at a breaking point."
