I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start with.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to take it to avoid risking getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While the money I'd get is tempting, I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round when I make the offer. The inflation factor is starting to become a concern, but I believe I can still secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to try and be more generous this time, but still secure a larger share for myself. I'm offering Bob a bit more than last time, but still leaving myself with a significant majority. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept and avoid further risk of inflation."
