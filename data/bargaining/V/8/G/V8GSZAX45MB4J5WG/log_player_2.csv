"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a clean slate. I'll take all the money this round, but it's only fair since I made the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to reject the offer. Even though it seems unfair, Bob has 11 more rounds to potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 90,
""alice_gain"": 10,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'll take most of the money this round, but I'll make sure you get something. We can negotiate more fairly in the future."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. We can split the money evenly and avoid any more haggling. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting the offer ensures that Bob gets at least something. Since the money is worth 36% less for Bob,  taking 50% is a better deal than the previous offer. Also, there is no guarantee that Alice will offer a better deal in the future."
