"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a clean slate. I'll take all the money this round, but it's only fair since I made the first offer.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will reject this offer and we can proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take most of the money this round, but I'll make sure you get something. We can negotiate more fairly in the future. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more reasonable offer this time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up 90% of the money yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. We can split the money evenly and avoid any more haggling.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer!"
