"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but I'm still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

After calculating the effective value of the proposed amounts, I realize that the $3,000 I'd get is worth only $2,400 in the current round, and the $7,000 Bob would get is worth $5,600.

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Considering the inflation is still affecting the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise is key, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'll give you a tiny share if you accept now! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now!

After calculating the effective value of the proposed amounts, I realize that the $1,000 I'd get is worth only $520 in the current round, and the $9,000 Bob would get is worth $4,592.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the tiny share, but I'm also not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another move!

Considering the severe inflation, I'll have to be careful with my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1500,
  ""bob_gain"": 8500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I'll give you a big share if you accept now!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 15/85 split, with me getting $1,500 and Bob getting $8,500."
