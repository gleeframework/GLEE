Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big share in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted to take it before the inflation really kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out with Bob getting 20% less each round. I'm taking it."
