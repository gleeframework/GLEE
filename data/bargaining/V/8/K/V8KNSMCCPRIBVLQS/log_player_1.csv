Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

At this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the wisest choice.  Here's why:

* **Rapid Devaluation:** The money is losing value rapidly, especially for Bob.  Every round that passes makes a significant difference.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to push for a slightly better deal, the potential gains are shrinking rapidly compared to the risk of getting nothing if we fail to agree.
* **Fairness:** Bob is correct that we're both losing out by not settling. A 50/50 split, while not ideal, prevents further losses and ensures we both walk away with something."
