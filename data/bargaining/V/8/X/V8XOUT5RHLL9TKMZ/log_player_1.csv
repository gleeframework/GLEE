"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced division. Each of us gets half of the remaining amount after the previous round's adjustment. This should encourage fair play. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
