"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to take a bit more this time, but I think this is still fair. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my $4000 gain is worth 90% of the $5000 I could have gotten in the first round. That's a bit less than I'd like. But I don't want to push my luck and risk getting a worse offer in the next round.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my potential gains are worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more this time, but I think it's fair considering the inflation!""
}
