Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer is fair and leaves us both with a decent amount. We can avoid further inflation and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Both of our potential gains are decreasing rapidly. Delaying further risks a significantly smaller payout for both of us. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob rejecting my previous offers, including a 65/35 split in his favor, suggests he's aiming for at least a 50/50 split.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of ending up with nothing if Bob continues to play hardball."
