Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation favors you, but your offer was too low. Let's split the difference - 52/48 sounds fair considering we're both losing value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
