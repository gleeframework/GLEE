"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I propose to take 999,000 dollars and give Bob 1,000 dollars. This is a pretty generous offer, as I am taking almost all of the money. However, I am hoping that Bob will accept this offer since he gets something, and it's better than nothing. If he doesn't, I will be able to make a more aggressive offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, I realize that inflation will continue to devalue my gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's likely that Bob will take a larger share in the next round."
