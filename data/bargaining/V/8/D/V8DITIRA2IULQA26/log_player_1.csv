Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I want more for myself. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I could have gotten in the first round. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal. I'll give you 30%, but I'm not going lower.  Accept this and we can both walk away with something.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up yet. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up most of the money. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While this offer is still less than what I would have liked, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for me. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point."
