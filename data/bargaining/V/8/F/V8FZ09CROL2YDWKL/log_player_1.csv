"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 400k, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 600,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'll try to negotiate from here! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate from a strong position.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I don't think 300,000 is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer was 600,000. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 550k is a fairer split. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 550,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still holding out for a better deal.

Considering the inflation, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I'd gain is 400,000 / 0.727 = 550,555.69.

However, I'd rather not accept an offer that's slightly less than my previous offer, especially since I was already willing to compromise. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle! 500k for both of us, a fair and equal split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 500,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 500,000 dollars."
