"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable split. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate is higher for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While the offer is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal. I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly this time.  It's a fair starting point, and we can both benefit from avoiding further inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair split, but the inflation is hitting you harder.  This offer still gives you a decent share while accounting for the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous offer, but I still think I can get a more equitable split.  I'm willing to gamble and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""We're both losing money with each round.  Let's compromise on a slightly uneven split to avoid further losses.  I'm willing to concede a bit more to get this deal done.""}
