"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $900,000 is now worth only $720,000. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have $500,000, which is a significant cut from my original expectation.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that I'll be able to negotiate better in future rounds.
