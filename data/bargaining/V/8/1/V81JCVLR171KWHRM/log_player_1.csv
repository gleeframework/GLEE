"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000 and Bob can take 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take the majority, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to Round 1, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a slight adjustment to the split, giving Bob a slightly larger share this time. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to be generous 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out, but I'm not giving up yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate further and get a better deal. This offer is still not satisfactory, and I'm willing to take another round to try to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob compared to Round 1, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. This offer is a slight adjustment from my previous one, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
