I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. While the inflation is impacting Bob, I'm not willing to settle for less than half at this stage. Let's see if he's willing to negotiate further."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 50

This is a good time to take the deal. Bob is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation and offering an even split. While I could potentially push for a bit more in the next round or two, there's a risk that Bob might dig in his heels and offer even less as the inflation continues to affect him. Accepting now guarantees me a fair share and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
