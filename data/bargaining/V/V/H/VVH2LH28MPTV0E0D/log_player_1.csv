"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a relatively balanced offer, with me taking a slight edge. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my initial offer would have been worth less in real terms, so Bob's offer is actually more attractive now.
