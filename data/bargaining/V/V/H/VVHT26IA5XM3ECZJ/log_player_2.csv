"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  This offer leaves us both with a good amount.

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a sizable share Alice, but I'm taking on more risk with the inflation. Let's be fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the risk, but my offer in round 1 was more than fair. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking close to her original offer, trying to take advantage of my losses to inflation. While the deal is getting worse for me each round, it's also getting slightly worse for her. I need to hold out for a better offer, but I'll need to be more aggressive soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out for both of us. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but this needs to be settled this round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise.  We both need to agree to move forward. This is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice is offering a compromise, but it's heavily skewed in her favor.  While she acknowledges the inflation, her offer doesn't reflect the increasing risk for me. I need to show I'm serious about getting a better share, even if it means getting closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution considering the time pressure and inflation. Accept now, or we both lose.""}"
