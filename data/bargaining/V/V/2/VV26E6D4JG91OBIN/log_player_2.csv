# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage, and while the value of the money is decreasing, I'm still better off holding out for a better deal. It's getting risky, but I need to push back."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the bigger share, you're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is running out.  While Alice is still getting a much larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me something. If I reject it, the inflation means we'll both lose even more value, and I risk getting nothing at all if we can't agree in the remaining rounds. It's a gamble I'm no longer willing to take."
