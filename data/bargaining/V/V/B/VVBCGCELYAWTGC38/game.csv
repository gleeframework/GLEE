6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000. It's important to settle this early before inflation eats away at the value.",Alice,1,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The value is dropping fast.  My turn, I get $5,800, you get $4,200. This is a good deal considering we're losing money every round.",Alice,3,

5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, we're running out of time!  I'll take a slight hit to get this done.  I get $5,600, you get $4,400.  Let's settle this before we both lose out!",Alice,5,

4200.0,5800.0,"I'm willing to take a bigger share of the remaining value, considering the rapid inflation. 58-42 is my new offer.",Bob,6,
