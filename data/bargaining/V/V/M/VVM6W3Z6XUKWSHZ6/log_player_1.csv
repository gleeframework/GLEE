"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the initial amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is 60% of the initial amount. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll give you $500,000 and keep $500,000 for myself. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $475,000. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split, which is a bit more equal than my initial offer, but I was hoping for a bit more.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 90.25% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $450,250. I'll take this into account when making my next offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share. You'll get $450,000, and I'll keep $550,000.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want to keep a bit more. You'll get $475,000, and I'll keep $525,000. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $550,000 from the previous round is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $472,550. Considering Bob's new offer, I'm getting $475,000, which is a bit more than my current equivalent gain. However, I'm still getting less than I initially proposed.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a slightly better deal than what I had before.
