Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is getting worse for me. I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you 45, which is more than what I had in the first round. Time is running out!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is finally being reasonable. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal or nothing at all as time runs out."
