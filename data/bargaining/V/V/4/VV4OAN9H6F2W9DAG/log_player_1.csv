"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point.""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous offer considering I'm starting the negotiations. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This is a more equitable starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think 35 is too low, considering I started with a more generous offer in the first round. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's meet in the middle.""}\n\nI've reduced my initial offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe I should get a larger share. The message is a clear indication that I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable solution."
