"Round 1

I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  It's better than what I would get if we keep rejecting each other and the value of the money decreases further."
