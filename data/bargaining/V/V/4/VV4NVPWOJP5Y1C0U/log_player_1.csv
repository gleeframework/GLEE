"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Take 40%!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. This offer is fairer and gives me a bit more for the risk I'm taking by rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting counteroffer from Bob!

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his $5,500 is actually equivalent to $4,400 in the original amount. Considering this, I'd rather stick with my original proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split it 50/50!""
}
```

I'm now proposing a 50/50 split, which is a bit more generous to Bob than my initial offer. Let's see how he responds!"
