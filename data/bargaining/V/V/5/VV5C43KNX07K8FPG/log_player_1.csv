Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think we can find a more equitable split. Let's shoot for a 55/45 split in my favor this round.  With inflation eating away at the pot, it's important to reach a deal quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
