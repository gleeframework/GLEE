"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial $10,000. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial gain of $8,000 is now worth $6,400.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only $4,000, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept it.
