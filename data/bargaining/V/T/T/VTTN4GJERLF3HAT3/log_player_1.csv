Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is hurting both of us. Let's end this with a fair 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game goes on, the more I lose due to the higher inflation rate.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further haggling is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome for me. Bob seems anchored to a relatively even split.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees me 5000 (worth 3650 of the original value), whereas further rejections risk ending up with even less."
