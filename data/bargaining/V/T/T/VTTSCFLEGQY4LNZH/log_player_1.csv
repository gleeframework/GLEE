"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves a significant portion for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, as the inflation will hurt him more than me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While it gives me a bit more than the previous round, the inflation rate is significant, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, hoping to capitalize on Bob's growing financial pressure due to inflation.  This offer still gives him a decent amount, but I believe I can secure a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6040 
# Bob gain: 3960 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting less than what I offered in the previous round, the inflation is hurting Bob much more than me.  It's time to take the deal and secure a decent amount of money before it's worth even less."
