"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

This offer is a straightforward 50/50 split, with each of us receiving $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $5,000 gain in the first round is now worth $4,750, and Bob's $5,000 gain is now worth $4,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm looking for a better deal. Maybe I can negotiate a better split in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my $4,750 gain in the previous round is now worth $4,469.25 (5% less than $4,750).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

This offer is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm still trying to hold onto a larger share. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
