"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while accounting for potential future inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 75/25 split might seem fair initially, it's crucial to consider the potential impact of inflation. As Bob, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and the game states that the money is worth 0% less for me with each passing round. This implies Alice might be less affected by inflation, making this offer increasingly unfavorable for me in future rounds.  

By rejecting, I can gain the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
