"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, but I believe I deserve a bit more since I'm making the first offer and taking on the risk of the game. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is a hint to Bob that I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 55/45, but let's get this done before the money shrinks too much. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the split is relatively fair, I believe I can get a better deal considering the inflation rates. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob in each round, I think Bob will be more eager to settle in the next round to minimize his losses. By rejecting this offer, I'm taking a calculated risk to potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting us both, let's settle""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation rates, I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer than in Round 1, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. The message ""Inflation is hurting us both, let's settle"" aims to create a sense of urgency and shared loss, encouraging Bob to accept this offer before the money loses even more value. By settling now, we can both minimize our losses due to inflation."
