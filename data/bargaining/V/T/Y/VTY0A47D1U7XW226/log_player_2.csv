"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more now to account for future inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too early to accept such a lopsided deal. Let's see if Alice is willing to be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split, Alice.  We can adjust later if needed, but a fair starting point is important.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle.  This accounts for the inflation we both face. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is more equitable and accounts for inflation. It's better to accept than risk further rounds and potentially getting less."
