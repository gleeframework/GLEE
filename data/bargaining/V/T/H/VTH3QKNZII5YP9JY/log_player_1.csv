Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this offer is more equitable. Take some time to consider.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to a deal. This is a slight increase on my previous offer to reflect the time pressure.

# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I need to hold firm. Accepting now would still give Bob a larger share, and the devaluation favors me more as time passes."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this now and both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. 

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing dramatically increases if I continue to reject Bob's offers. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While the devaluation favors me, it also means that holding out for a significantly better offer in the later rounds might not result in a substantial gain, especially considering the risk.  
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout. 
 
This situation highlights the classic game theory dilemma of balancing greed and risk."
