Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The money is worth less to you now. I think 70/30 is a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While my buying power diminishes, the actual amount I get is still important. Accepting $300,000 is a significant loss, even if it's worth less in future rounds. I need to push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking further inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Bob, this isn't a game to see how much you can exploit inflation. I'm willing to be more flexible, but a 70/30 split is insulting. Let's settle this with 45/55.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Ground:**  It's clear Bob is digging in and using the inflation to his advantage. Offering him a slightly larger share might be the only way to break the stalemate. 
* **Deadline Pressure:**  While I'm still willing to reject unfavorable offers, time is running out. The longer this goes on, the less my share is worth. A 45/55 split now is better than potentially getting a worse deal later.
* **Strong Message:**  The message emphasizes that I'm making a concession but am not happy about his exploitative tactics. This might make him reconsider pushing for too much in future rounds if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation, I think 75/25 is a more reasonable ratio now. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, as the inflation is really cutting into my potential gains. However, accepting 25% of the total amount feels extremely unfair. Bob is clearly trying to pressure me into a bad deal by highlighting the decreasing value, but I'm banking on him being reasonable and understanding there needs to be a fairer split to reach an agreement. I'm willing to gamble that he'll offer something better in the next round rather than risk everything falling apart completely."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm making a final offer.  35/65.  Take it or leave it. This needs to be settled now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** It's clear Bob is trying to maximize his gain, but I need to draw a line in the sand. This offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal but still represents a sizeable sum.
* **Ultimatum:** By framing this as my final offer, I'm hoping to add pressure on Bob. He knows that time is running out, and further delay only hurts me. There's a chance he'll realize pushing for a larger share could result in no deal at all.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While 35% is far from ideal, accepting a poor deal now is better than risking a complete loss if we fail to reach an agreement. This offer balances the risk of getting a worse deal later with the potential reward of ending the negotiation with a reasonable, though not ideal, amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering Alice's desperation and the increasing inflation, I think 80/20 is a more reasonable ratio now. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a painful decision, but I have to be realistic. Here's why I'm choosing to accept this offer, even though it's far from ideal:

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation has eroded over half the value of my potential gain. Waiting any longer will only make things worse. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has been consistently pushing for a larger share, and his message indicates he believes I'm desperate. He's unlikely to offer anything better.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Accepting $200,000, even with the reduced buying power, is better than walking away with nothing if we can't reach an agreement.

This entire negotiation highlights the power of patience and the dangers of being on the losing side of inflation."
