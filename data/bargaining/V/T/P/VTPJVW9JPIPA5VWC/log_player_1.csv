"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining 10 rounds between us!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. My message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer and start the next round, where I'll have the opportunity to propose again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll regret rejecting my offer! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make up for the loss in value due to inflation.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that's even more skewed towards Bob's gain.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! We can still have a good split!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a more balanced split, considering the reduced value of the money. My message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer and move forward."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still lowballing me, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to get a better deal.

Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly. However, I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is a good one. The ratio of Bob's gain to mine is still quite skewed.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""This is my best offer, Bob. Take it or leave it!""

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to get a better deal, but his offer is actually the same as my previous offer from round 5. Considering the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer to compensate for the inflation.

However, since Bob's offer is the same as my previous offer, I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.
