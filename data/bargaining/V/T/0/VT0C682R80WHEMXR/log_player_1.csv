"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this initial offer, Alice proposes that she receives $60 while Bob receives $40, along with a message suggesting this division is fair, with her getting a bit more. This sets the stage for negotiations, considering the impact of inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split. This considers the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice decides to reject Bob's offer, considering the time pressure and inflation impact but likely aiming for a more favorable split in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet closer to the middle, slightly in my favor""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice adjusts her proposal, considering the inflation impact. She slightly reduces her share from the initial offer, aiming to meet Bob closer to the middle but still maintains a favorable position for herself, hoping Bob will accept before further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nAlice decides to accept Bob's offer of an even split. Given the increasing impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of her potential gain by 27.1% since the first round, she likely calculates that further rounds will only diminish her share's value more significantly than any marginal increase she might negotiate. Accepting the 50/50 split at this point maximizes her real gain, considering the time pressure and devaluation."
