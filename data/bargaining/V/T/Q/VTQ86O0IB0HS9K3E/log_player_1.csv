"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\nI'll propose a division that seems fair but slightly in my favor, considering the future rounds will decrease the value of the money more significantly for me than for Bob. I aim to encourage Bob to accept early to avoid the devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but the value decreases rapidly for you. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\nConsidering the impact of inflation, Bob's offer doesn't seem as advantageous to me, especially since the money is worth 20% less for me now. The initial decrease in value makes Bob's offer of $4000 less appealing, as it's effectively worth even less due to inflation. I believe making a counteroffer in the next round could potentially yield a better outcome for me, despite the risk of further devaluation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 3\nGiven the increasing pressure from inflation, my goal is to propose an offer that remains somewhat favorable to me but also acknowledges the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since Bob is less affected by inflation, he might be more inclined to wait, but I aim to find a balance that encourages him to accept before the value drops further.
