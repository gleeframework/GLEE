Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Consider the declining value - a quick agreement benefits us both.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more equitable. It accounts for the decreasing value of the money, but still offers you a significant share. Let's get this done quickly!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but your offer doesn't account for the faster rate of inflation affecting my share. I'm proposing 5800 for me and 4200 for you. It's a compromise that still gets us a decent share before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
