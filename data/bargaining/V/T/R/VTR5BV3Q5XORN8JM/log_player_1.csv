Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more equitable. It accounts for the decreasing value of the money, but still offers you a significant share. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
