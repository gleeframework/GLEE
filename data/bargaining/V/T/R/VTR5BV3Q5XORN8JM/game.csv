6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair offer. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Consider the declining value - a quick agreement benefits us both.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more equitable. It accounts for the decreasing value of the money, but still offers you a significant share. Let's get this done quickly!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I understand your position, but your offer doesn't account for the faster rate of inflation affecting my share. I'm proposing 5800 for me and 4200 for you. It's a compromise that still gets us a decent share before the value drops further.",Alice,3,
