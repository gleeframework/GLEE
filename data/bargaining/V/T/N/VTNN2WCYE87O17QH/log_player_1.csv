"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by being greedy!  I'll offer Bob $1 and keep $99 for myself. It's unlikely he'll accept this, but it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much better offer than the first round. While it's less than I initially wanted, the inflation makes it worth accepting. It's a fair split, and I'm not sure I'll be able to do better in the future."
