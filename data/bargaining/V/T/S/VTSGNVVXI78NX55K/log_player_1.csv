"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split. I'm hoping this is a fair starting point, and that Bob will see the value in accepting it rather than risking losing money through inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me 500,000, which is a significant amount. With inflation, there's no guarantee I'll get more if I reject this offer."
