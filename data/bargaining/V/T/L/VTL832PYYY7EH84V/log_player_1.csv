"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going for a very lopsided split in my favor, knowing that Bob's money will be worth less in subsequent rounds.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm getting half the money, Bob is still getting a significant amount, and with the inflation factor, his gains will only decrease in the next rounds. I'm going to try to push for a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still aiming for a very lopsided split, but I'm slightly reducing my share to make the offer more tempting for Bob.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting rather than facing further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than the previous round. Even though he's losing value due to inflation, he's still gaining a significantly larger share of the money. I'm going to reject this and try to push for a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm going to reduce my share again, but only slightly. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting a deal now, before the inflation hits him even harder.  I need to strike a balance between getting a good share and ensuring he doesn't get too frustrated and reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 333333 
# Bob gain: 666667 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still incredibly lopsided in his favor. Even with the significant inflation on his gains, he's still getting a much larger share of the money. I'm going to reject this and continue to push for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm going to keep lowering my share, but I'm not going to go below 700,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer before the inflation hits him even harder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still completely unacceptable. Even though Bob's gains are significantly reduced due to inflation, he is still receiving a much larger share.  I'm going to continue trying to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to drop my offer to 600,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this deal before the inflation hits him even harder. The next round will be a significant drop for him, so I'm hoping he will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 416667 
# Bob gain: 583333 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a frustrating situation. While Bob is facing a significant decrease in the value of his gains, he still proposes to get almost 2/3 of the money. I am going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a more equitable division in the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to propose an even split.  The inflation will hit Bob hard in the next round, and I don't want to risk him getting nothing.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in a fair deal and accept."
