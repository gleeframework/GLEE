Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer before inflation eats away at your share even more! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation hitting her harder.  While this offer is better than her last, she's still aiming for a larger share. I need to hold out a bit longer to capitalize on her desperation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. The inflation is hurting us both.  A 50/50 split is the fairest I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on both of us now, but Alice is feeling it more.  By offering an even split, I'm signaling that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I'm not willing to be taken advantage of.  This offer is simple, direct, and underscores the urgency of the situation."
