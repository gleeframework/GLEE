"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I propose to take $9000 and leave $1000 for Bob. This is a very unequal split, but I want to see if he's willing to accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject this offer.  It's the exact same proposal as before, just with the roles reversed. I'm not going to accept that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm proposing a more even split this time. I'm willing to take a bit less to see if we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is just the same as the last one with the roles reversed again. I'm starting to think Bob is trying to take advantage of me!  I'll reject this offer as well."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split for Bob this time, hoping that he'll start to see the value in reaching an agreement. If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we both risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This is just another mirrored offer. I'm starting to get annoyed. I'm going to reject this and see if he'll actually try to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4900, ""bob_gain"": 5100} 
```

I'm starting to think Bob wants a slightly bigger share, so I'm offering him a slightly larger share this time. This is a pretty even split, and I think it's time to reach a compromise."
