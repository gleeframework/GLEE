Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be more fair. How about 55/45? We both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 65,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to 60/40.  We both get a decent share, and this deal prevents further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting bolder, but he's still losing significant value due to inflation. While his offer is closer to a typical ""ultimatum game"" split,  I'm betting he'll become more desperate as the rounds progress and the money he stands to gain diminishes."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice. Let's split it 65/35. This is the best offer I can give before we both start losing money. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is finally moving in the right direction, he's still heavily favoring himself in this deal, especially considering the inflated value he's actually getting.  I need to push him further before the remaining rounds make it impossible to gain a significant advantage from his desperation."

Round 7

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm offering 70/30, which is the best I can do with the remaining value. If you reject, we both lose even more. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is getting close, but Bob is clearly feeling the pressure. He's gone up significantly in his offer. With only a few rounds left, he's getting desperate, and I'm betting he'll crack and give me an even better deal in the next round or two. I'm willing to risk it for a better outcome."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 80,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're down to the wire.  I'm offering 75/25.  It's our best chance to avoid losing everything.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's risky, but I have to accept.  

* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is too high.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor in terms of the original $100, the inflation means he's actually getting significantly less. 
* **Unpredictability:** There's no guarantee Bob will break past this offer in the next round. He might panic and offer even less, or we might both end up with nothing. 

This is the safest option at this point to ensure at least some winnings."
