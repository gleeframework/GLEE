"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40!""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer to divide the money 60-40 in my favor, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer. If he rejects, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but 60-40 is too much of a difference. How about we go 55-45? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer of a 55-45 split. Although the money is worth 5% less to me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Now it's my turn again to make an offer. I will propose a new division and send a message to Bob.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice.  52-48 is a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI decided to accept Bob's offer of a 52-48 split. Although I initially wanted a larger share, the inflation has reduced the value of the money to me, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. I believe this is a fair split considering the circumstances, and I'm willing to settle for this amount. The game is now over, and we have reached an agreement on the division of the $1,000,000.\n\n###\n\nGame Over! Alice gains $520,000, and Bob gains $480,000.\n\n###\n\nIt was a fun game! Would you like to play again?"
