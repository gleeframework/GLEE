Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, before the value drops even further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 36% less now, accepting the offer of an even split seems reasonable to minimize further loss due to inflation."
