4000.0,6000.0,"Let's be reasonable. I'll take 60%, you take 40%.  It's a fair starting point, and we can both get a decent amount before inflation bites too hard.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%.  Let's split it 70/30 this time.  We can both get a good amount before inflation gets out of hand.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's try 55/45. We both still get a good chunk of money, and we can avoid losing too much to inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,I'm getting frustrated with the back and forth. Let's meet in the middle. 60/40. This is a reasonable split considering how much we've already lost to inflation.,Alice,5,
