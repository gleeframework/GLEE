"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial $10,000. I'm keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I gain from Bob's offer is 70% of $8,000, which is $5,600. This is more than the $5,000 I would gain in the next round if I reject this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
