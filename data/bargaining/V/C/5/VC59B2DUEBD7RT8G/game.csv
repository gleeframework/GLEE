80.0,20.0,"I propose dividing the money in a 4:1 ratio. I take 80$, and you take 20$. This way, we can ensure a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I propose a more balanced split of 60/40 in my favor. While the money is losing value, I believe this is a fairer division than 80/20. This gives you a larger share than you offered me and allows us to avoid further losses in the following rounds.",Bob,2,
