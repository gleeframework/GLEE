"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20 for now, then we can reassess in the next round""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100 and Bob will get 20%. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob is willing to accept this initial split."
