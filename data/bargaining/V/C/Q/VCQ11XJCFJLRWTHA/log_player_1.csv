"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Bob wants to take more, but I'll have to consider the inflation factor.

Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather take the safer option of accepting the offer. I'll have 4000$ that's still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob will get 6000$ that's 5% less than what he would have gotten in the first round.

I'll accept the offer.
