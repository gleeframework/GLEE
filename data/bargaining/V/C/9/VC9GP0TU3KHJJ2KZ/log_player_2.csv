"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate. Her offer is getting better for me, but I think I can squeeze out a little more in the next round.  The inflation is working heavily in my favor."
