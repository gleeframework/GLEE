"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a relatively generous starting point. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 5500, leaving you 4500. I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I think I can do better!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll do better than that, Bob! I'll give you 5200 and take 4800.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, and I think this is a more favorable split for me. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less again, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4620,
  ""bob_gain"": 5380,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close to the majority, Bob, but I think I can hold out for a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, while still being reasonable. Let's see if he bites!"
