I'm going for a high initial offer to see if Bob is willing to take a small share for a quick resolution.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'm getting a bit less than I initially hoped for, inflation is a real risk.  I'd rather secure half of the money now than risk getting nothing at all later."
