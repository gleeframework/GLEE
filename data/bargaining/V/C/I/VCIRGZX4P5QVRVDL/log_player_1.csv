"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good foundation""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 600,000 and Bob will take 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the compromise, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as attached to the original 60-40 split.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'm not happy about it:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
