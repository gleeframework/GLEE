"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob.  I take a bit more now so we both lose less to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Your turn Alice, but let's be realistic. This offer minimizes the impact of inflation for both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject it, hoping she'd become more reasonable as the value decreases.
* **My counter-offer:** While still slightly favoring Alice, it's a significantly better deal for Bob than the previous round.  
* **The message:** The message aims to:
    * Remind Alice it's her turn to lose value in the next round.
    * Frame the offer as a logical compromise that benefits both parties by mitigating inflation's impact."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money Bob, literally!  Let's end this before inflation eats our profits.  My offer is still generous. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and trying to use it to her advantage. However, her offer is getting worse for me, not better.  It's clear she's prioritizing her own gains and hoping I'll panic as the value decreases.  I need to hold firm and present a more reasonable counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. This offer ensures we both lose the least to inflation.  A 50/50 split is the fairest solution.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting the dynamic:** Alice is clearly aiming for a larger share, but her offers are becoming less reasonable as time passes. A bold 50/50 split forces her to reconsider her approach. 
* **Appealing to logic:**  By emphasizing the fairness and practicality of an even split, the message aims to make Alice see the situation objectively rather than focusing on maximizing her own gain.
* **Time pressure:**  While the 50/50 split benefits both of us in the long run, the message subtly reminds Alice that her share will decrease significantly if she rejects this offer and we move to another round."
