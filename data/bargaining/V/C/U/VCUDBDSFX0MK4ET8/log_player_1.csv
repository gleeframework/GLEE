``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly impatient but continues to undervalue the impact of inflation on his potential winnings. While his offer is inching closer to a more reasonable split, I'm still in a strong position to negotiate for a better deal. The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for him, not me."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I've lowered my offer, but you're not really gaining anything by delaying. 51/49 is the best you'll get. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and Bob should be feeling the pressure. By framing this offer as my ""best and final,"" I'm hoping to force a decision.
* **Slight Concession:** I've lowered my offer slightly to show I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not budging much further. 
* **Highlighting Inflation:**  While I don't explicitly mention it, the message underscores that his stalling tactics aren't helping him."
