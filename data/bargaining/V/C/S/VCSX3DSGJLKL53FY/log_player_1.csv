"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end the game here!""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, which I think is a generous offer considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more! 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'll have to consider that in my decision.

In this case, I'll reject Bob's offer because it's not as favorable to me as my initial offer. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not as favorable as mine, I'll make a new offer that's even more generous to him, but still reasonable for me.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, this should be a good compromise!""
}
```

I'm giving Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount, in the hopes that he'll accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll calculate the effective value of the money Bob gains in this round. Since it's worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll divide 300,000 by 0.518 (1 - 0.482) to get the equivalent value in the first round.

Effective value of Bob's gain in round 1 = 300,000 / 0.518 ≈ 579,051

Now, I'll compare this to my initial offer in round 1, where I gained 900,000. This offer is still more favorable to me than Bob's current offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's even more aggressive, considering the fact that Bob's offers have been getting progressively better.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger either, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm giving Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount, in the hopes that he'll accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting late, let's split it down the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is getting crazy!

Let's calculate the effective value of the money Bob gains in this round. Since it's worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'll divide 500,000 by 0.326 (1 - 0.6723) to get the equivalent value in the first round.

Effective value of Bob's gain in round 1 = 500,000 / 0.326 ≈ 1,533,145

Now, I'll compare this to my initial offer in round 1, where I gained 900,000. This offer is actually more favorable to me than my initial offer!

Considering the significant inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer from round 6.
