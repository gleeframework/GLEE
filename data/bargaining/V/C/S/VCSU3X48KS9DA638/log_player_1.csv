"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fair, but slightly advantageous, offer. I believe Bob will find this acceptable, but if he rejects it, I'll adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to make a more aggressive offer this round, trying to get a better split than the previous round's offer. I will see if Bob is willing to accept this more even distribution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer is still not ideal, the inflation is really hurting me. I'll take what I can get at this point."
