9000.0,1000.0,I think it's fair to split the money 90/10 in my favor. I'm confident that I can make this money grow for both of us in the future.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more reasonable, considering we both want to walk away with a decent amount. Let's meet in the middle!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still think a 80/20 split is fair considering the potential for future growth. Let's make a deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think a 65/35 split is more reasonable. I'm willing to take a bit more to account for the decrease in value, but I still want to make sure you get a fair share.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I'm trying to be reasonable here, but I can't go much lower than this.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Considering the substantial effect of inflation, I think a 75/25 split is necessary to ensure I get a fair share. I understand this might seem high, but the decreasing value of the money means I need to adjust my expectations.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I still believe in a more even split. Let's meet halfway at 60/40.  It's the best compromise we can make at this point.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
1500.0,8500.0,"Given the extreme impact of inflation, I need to prioritize getting the highest amount possible. A 85/15 split might seem unfair, but it's necessary to compensate for the drastic decrease in value. I hope you understand the circumstances and will consider this proposal.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Inflation is hitting us both hard now. Let's split the money evenly and call it a day. We can't afford to keep fighting over a few thousand dollars.,Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Given the extremely high inflation, I'm forced to prioritize getting the highest amount possible. A 90/10 split might seem unfair, but it's necessary to compensate for the drastic decrease in value. I hope you understand the circumstances and will consider this proposal. This is likely my last chance to get a decent amount, so I'm willing to take a risk.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"We're both running out of time here.  I'm willing to go down to 40/60 to secure something for us.  It's not ideal, but it's better than both of us getting nothing.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
500.0,9500.0,"Given the extremely high inflation, I'm forced to prioritize getting the highest amount possible. A 95/5 split might seem unfair, but it's necessary to compensate for the drastic decrease in value. This is my last chance to get a decent amount, so I'm willing to take a final risk. If you reject this offer, we'll both get nothing, and I'd rather take that risk than settle for a lower amount that's worth almost nothing due to inflation.",Bob,12,
