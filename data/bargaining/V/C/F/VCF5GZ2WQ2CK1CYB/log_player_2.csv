"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair to split the money 90/10 in my favor. I'm confident that I can make this money grow for both of us in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's proposal is too skewed in her favor, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more reasonable, considering we both want to walk away with a decent amount. Let's meet in the middle!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still think a 80/20 split is fair considering the potential for future growth. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice has come down from her initial 90/10 proposal, an 80/20 split still doesn't seem fair to me, especially considering the inflation that's reducing the value of my potential gain. I'll take my chances and proceed to the next round to see if I can negotiate a better deal. The fact that Alice is willing to negotiate gives me hope that we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation that's affecting my potential gain. Since the money is worth 36% less to me now, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount to compensate for the loss in value.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 65/35 split is more reasonable. I'm willing to take a bit more to account for the decrease in value, but I still want to make sure you get a fair share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to be reasonable here, but I can't go much lower than this.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice is trying to be more reasonable, a 70/30 split still doesn't seem fair to me, especially considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain. The money is now worth 59.04% less to me than in the first round, which means I'd actually be getting a lot less value than the initial numbers suggest. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping to find a better deal. The fact that Alice is willing to compromise gives me some hope that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to take into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money and aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss in value.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain. Since the money is worth 59.04% less to me now, I'll aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss in value.

{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""Considering the substantial effect of inflation, I think a 75/25 split is necessary to ensure I get a fair share. I understand this might seem high, but the decreasing value of the money means I need to adjust my expectations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I still believe in a more even split. Let's meet halfway at 60/40.  It's the best compromise we can make at this point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Although Alice is finally proposing a more even split, the impact of inflation on my potential gain is too significant to ignore. With the money being worth 73.79% less to me than in the first round, a 60/40 split would actually result in a much lower value for me than the numbers suggest. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping to find a better deal that takes into account the drastic decrease in value caused by inflation. At this point, I need to prioritize getting the highest amount possible to compensate for the loss in value.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8500, ""alice_gain"": 1500, ""message"": ""Given the extreme impact of inflation, I need to prioritize getting the highest amount possible. A 85/15 split might seem unfair, but it's necessary to compensate for the drastic decrease in value. I hope you understand the circumstances and will consider this proposal.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting us both hard now. Let's split the money evenly and call it a day. We can't afford to keep fighting over a few thousand dollars. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Although Alice is proposing an even split, the impact of inflation on my potential gain is too extreme to ignore. With the money being worth 83.22% less to me than in the first round, a 50/50 split would actually result in a very low value for me. At this point, I'm willing to take a risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to get an even higher amount to compensate for the drastic decrease in value. I understand that Alice is trying to be reasonable, but I need to prioritize my own interests given the circumstances.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Given the extremely high inflation, I'm forced to prioritize getting the highest amount possible. A 90/10 split might seem unfair, but it's necessary to compensate for the drastic decrease in value. I hope you understand the circumstances and will consider this proposal. This is likely my last chance to get a decent amount, so I'm willing to take a risk.""}"

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both running out of time here.  I'm willing to go down to 40/60 to secure something for us.  It's not ideal, but it's better than both of us getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Although Alice is proposing a split that's more in my favor, the impact of inflation on my potential gain is too extreme to ignore. With the money being worth 89.26% less to me than in the first round, even a 60/40 split in my favor would actually result in a very low value for me. At this point, I'm willing to take a risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to get an even higher amount to compensate for the drastic decrease in value. I understand that Alice is trying to be reasonable, but I need to prioritize my own interests given the circumstances. This is likely my last chance to get a decent amount, so I'll take one final risk.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 12
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9500, ""alice_gain"": 500, ""message"": ""Given the extremely high inflation, I'm forced to prioritize getting the highest amount possible. A 95/5 split might seem unfair, but it's necessary to compensate for the drastic decrease in value. This is my last chance to get a decent amount, so I'm willing to take a final risk. If you reject this offer, we'll both get nothing, and I'd rather take that risk than settle for a lower amount that's worth almost nothing due to inflation.""}"
