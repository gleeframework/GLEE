"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 80% of the remaining money. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to Round 2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not going to give up more.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, I'll take what I can get
