"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about meeting in the middle, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with the reduced value of the money due to inflation.
