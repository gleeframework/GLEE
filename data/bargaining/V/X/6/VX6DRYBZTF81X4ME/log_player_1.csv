"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and take 80% for myself.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob 20% of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000, and I'll take the remaining 80%, which is $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. You can take 60% and I'll take 40%. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my $6,000 gain in this round is actually worth 5% less than the $8,000 I would have gained in the first round. And Bob's $4,000 gain is worth 20% less than the $2,000 he would have gained in the first round.

However, this offer is indeed better than the one I made in the first round, and it's still a fair split considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
