Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share, but this split is more reflective of the decreasing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIt seems there was a misunderstanding in the instructions. Given the current state of the game and the effects of inflation, let's reassess and make a new proposal.\n\nConsidering the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, and taking into account the previous offers, I will adjust my proposal to make it more appealing while still favoring me slightly due to the inflationary pressure on Bob's side.\n\nHere's my revised offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, I've adjusted my offer to make it slightly more favorable to you while still considering the overall value decrease for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a compromise. We're running out of time and the value keeps decreasing. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 540000 
# Bob gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us, Bob's offer seems reasonable at this point. The difference in the loss of value between us is substantial, and continuing the game might lead to further losses that outweigh the potential gains from negotiating a slightly better deal.\n\nTherefore, I decide to accept Bob's offer to minimize further loss due to inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
