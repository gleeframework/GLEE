"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I get $60, you get $40. It's a fair offer considering the money loses value quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it closer to 55/45, in my favor, since the money is devaluing faster for me.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit on the inflation too.  My offer is $55 for me, $45 for you. Take it or leave it, the deal's only getting worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
