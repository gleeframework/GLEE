"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm willing to take a smaller share to get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nReasoning: In this game, since the money's value decreases with each round, it's beneficial to finalize a deal as early as possible. However, Alice's offer gives her a significantly larger share ($6000) compared to Bob ($4000). Given that Bob is only losing 10% value per round, as opposed to Alice's 20%, he has more room to negotiate without losing too much value. Rejecting the first offer gives Bob the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round or potentially force Alice into a less advantageous position due to her higher rate of value loss. Therefore, rejecting the offer to negotiate for a better deal makes strategic sense for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\nReasoning: Given that Bob has the upper hand in terms of value depreciation (10% loss per round for Bob vs. 20% for Alice), he can afford to make an offer that slightly favors himself while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider. By offering a split of $5500 for himself and $4500 for Alice, Bob is making a stronger claim on the money but still leaving room for negotiation. The message emphasizes the impact of inflation, hinting that future rounds will only decrease the value of the money, making this offer more appealing for both parties to settle on sooner rather than later. This approach tests Alice's willingness to accept a less favorable deal due to her higher loss rate, potentially ending the game in Bob's favor without risking too much value in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We both lose more with each passing round, so a 50/50 split makes the most sense. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nReasoning: Given the impact of inflation on both parties, with Bob's potential gain now worth 19% less and Alice's potential gain worth 36% less than the original amount, the pressure to finalize a deal increases. Alice's offer of a 50/50 split ($5000 each) is more equitable than her initial proposal and acknowledges the urgency due to inflation. Considering Bob's goal is to maximize his gain while the money still holds significant value, accepting this offer is the most reasonable decision. Rejecting it and proceeding to further rounds would risk diminishing the value of the money even more, potentially leading to a scenario where any gain is significantly less than what's offered now. By accepting, Bob secures a substantial amount while it's still worth more, making this the strategic choice under the current conditions."
