Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing. I'm coming down a bit, but this is a good deal for you given the rapid inflation you face. 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. The inflation is indeed a concern, but I still think I can negotiate a better deal. Alice is trying to pressure me, but I'll hold my ground.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll make another counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nMy proposal for Round 4:\n\n# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the urgency, but I'm not desperate. How about we split it 52/48?

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a small hit here to show I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. The difference between her offer and my previous proposals is not substantial enough to warrant further negotiation, especially given the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'll take the 3500, which is still a decent amount despite the inflation.\n\n###\n\nIt looks like the game is over! I hope I made the right decision."
