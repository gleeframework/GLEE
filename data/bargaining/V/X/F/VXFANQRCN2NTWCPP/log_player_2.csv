Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inch her way to a better deal. While the difference is getting smaller, accepting now sets a precedent that I'm willing to take a bit less. The inflation pressure is on both of us, and I'm betting she'll offer a more even split soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. We both lose if we keep this up.  50/50, take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to stand firm. The continued back and forth with minor concessions is pointless. A firm 50/50 split with a clear message that this is the final offer should push Alice to accept."
