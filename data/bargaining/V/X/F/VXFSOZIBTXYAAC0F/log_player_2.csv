"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to take a bit less so we can both get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While getting something is better than nothing, I believe I can negotiate a much fairer split, especially considering the inflation working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be more realistic. This offer recognizes the time pressure we both face.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but your last offer wasn't fair. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is slowly moving towards a more equitable split, but this offer is still unacceptable. The inflation is working heavily in my favor now, and she's feeling the pressure too. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out.  This is my final offer.""}
```"
