"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the larger share this time, but I'm open to negotiation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds generous at first, the significant difference in gains combined with the rapid inflation makes it a bad deal for me (Bob) in the long run. I believe I can negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be more realistic. This offer accounts for the time pressure and ensures a fairer split given the inflation rates. What do you say?"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is hitting us both hard, and a fair split seems like the best way forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is now much more reasonable considering the inflation. Accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is a better outcome than risking further devaluation of the money."
