"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI hope Bob accepts this offer! The message is short and to the point, emphasizing the fairness of the division. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round, I can still aim for a better deal. Let's reject this offer and see if I can get a better proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince Bob's money is worth 5% less in each round, I can try to take advantage of this and offer him a slightly smaller share. Let's see how he reacts!\n\n{""alice_gain"": 620000, ""bob_gain"": 380000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my share by 20,000 and decreased Bob's share by the same amount, while also mentioning the inflation to justify the offer. Will Bob accept this proposal?"
