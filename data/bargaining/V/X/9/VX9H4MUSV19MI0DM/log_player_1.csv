"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'll give you a smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to make a point!

I'll consider the new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not that desperate, I'll wait for a better offer""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. The money is worth less now, but I still want a fair share. I'm hoping Bob will come up with a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 42-58""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being a tough negotiator!

Let's calculate the actual values, considering the inflation:

Alice's gain in Round 4 is worth 85.74% of the value of Alice's gain in Round 1 (1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574).
Bob's gain in Round 4 is worth 51.2% of the value of Bob's gain in Round 1 (1 - 0.488 = 0.512).

Now, let's compare the values:

My gain in Round 1: $600,000
My gain in Round 4: $600,000 * 0.8574 = $514,440

Bob's gain in Round 1: $400,000
Bob's gain in Round 4: $400,000 * 0.512 = $204,800

Considering the values, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet, I'll wait for a better offer""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because my gain in Round 4 is significantly lower than my gain in Round 1, and I'm not convinced that this is the best deal. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 45-55""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to find a mutually acceptable solution."
