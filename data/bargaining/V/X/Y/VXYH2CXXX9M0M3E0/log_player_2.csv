Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take this small slice of the pie.  We can work out a better deal later if you want. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to see if Alice will offer more in the next round.  I'll be the one making the offer then, and I can hopefully get a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
