"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still generous.  Let's wrap this up - time is literally money! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offers but they don't reflect the time pressure on my end. This is a 60/40 split - it secures a good sum for both of us. Let's be done with this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer is a good compromise.  We both need to agree to ensure we get something from this! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the deal is getting worse, accepting $300,000 is better than nothing if I think she won't budge. However, I need to show strength and push for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than fair. Let's end this now before we both lose out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I am lowering my demand slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for a greater share due to the time pressure. The message is more assertive to emphasize the urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you need to meet me halfway. This is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the situation.  While $350,000 is a significant sum, it's clear she's aiming to keep the majority of the money. With six rounds left, I have room to negotiate a better deal, even with the increasing inflation. Accepting now would signal weakness and let her dictate the terms."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split.  It's fair, it's simple, and it ends this pointless back and forth. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. Alice has demonstrated she is unwilling to budge much from her initial offers.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point and ensures I walk away with a decent amount, even with the inflation. My message is firm to convey that this is my final offer."
