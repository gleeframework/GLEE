"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round, I need to consider that.

I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's offer, taking into account the inflation.

Initial $1,000,000, after 1 round of inflation, it's worth 95% of the original value, so $950,000.
After 2 rounds of inflation, it's worth 95% of $950,000, which is $902,500.

So, Bob's offer is equivalent to:

$902,500 (effective value) * 0.6 = $542,500 for Bob
$1,000,000 - $542,500 = $457,500 for me

I'll accept Bob's offer.
