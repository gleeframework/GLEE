Let's see how generous Bob is. I'm aiming for a big chunk of the money, but leaving a little for him to make the offer more tempting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is quite a bit better than my previous one. He's taken a big chunk of the money, but at least he's willing to share. However, I still think I can get more. I'll take my chances and see if I can improve the offer further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to maintain a large share but I'll be more reasonable this time. I want to make a decent offer that Bob will be more likely to accept, especially with inflation continuing."
