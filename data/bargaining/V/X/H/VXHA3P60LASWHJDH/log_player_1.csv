"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm aiming to get a good starting point with a strong majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While a 40/60 split is better than nothing, the inflation makes it much less appealing. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm offering a 65/35 split in my favor. While Bob's offer was tempting, I think we can find a compromise that is more favorable to both of us, given the inflation factor."
