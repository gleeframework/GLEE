"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $10,000 and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain would be 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6000, and then 20% less, which is $4800. Bob's offer of $5000 is actually a better deal for me in this round.

I accept Bob's offer.
