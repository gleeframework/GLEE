"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this now before the inflation hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am.  I'm willing to gamble that he'll be more amenable to a slightly better deal for me in the next round to avoid losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but let's be realistic. We both lose if this drags on.  This offer still gives you a good chunk, and we can both walk away winners.""
