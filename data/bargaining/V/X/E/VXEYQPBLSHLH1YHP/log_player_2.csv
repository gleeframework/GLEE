"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. Take this generous offer while it lasts, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. With the money being worth 10% less for me in each round, I'm willing to take the risk and try to negotiate for a higher amount. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth 10% less to me in each round, I'll try to get a better deal.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice! This is a fair deal considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob, but this is my final offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the inflation, I think this is the best deal I can get. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round, so I'll take the 250,000 dollars.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGame over! It was a tough negotiation, but I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Alice!"
