"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. After Bob's unreasonable offer, I believe a fair and equal division is the best way to move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I receive something, while rejecting it risks getting nothing at all in the final round."
