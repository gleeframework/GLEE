"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you 20% of the total. Accept and we can split the remaining 80%.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got 80% last round, I'm offering 75% this time. Accept and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the new offer from Bob.

I'll think for a moment...

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I was hoping to get a bit more, but Bob is being reasonable. However, I don't want to give up too much either.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round. Maybe I can do better next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again.

Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40% of its original value now. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 60% of the remaining value. It's a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're taking 60% this round, I'll offer 55%. It's a slight adjustment, but I think we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a bit.

Considering the inflation, the money is worth a lot less now, and I'm not sure if I want to give up more than 55% of the remaining value.

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. At this point, I'm not sure if I can do better, and 55% of the remaining value is still a decent amount."
