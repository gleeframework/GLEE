"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

I'm offering to take 75% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 25%. This is a fairly generous offer, considering the game is just starting and we both have a long way to go before the money becomes worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 640000 
# Bob gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer... Considering the inflation rates, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

My gain of $640,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $750,000. That's a reduction of $110,000.

Bob's gain of $360,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $250,000. That's an increase of $110,000.

Hmm... I think I'll accept this offer. It's not as good as my original proposal, but it's better than nothing, and it's a relatively small reduction from my original gain.
