I'm offering Bob a small portion to incentivize him to accept, hoping to get the majority of the money early on before inflation takes effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something now, I'm confident that I can get a better deal later.  The inflation will hurt Bob more than me, and I'm sure I can leverage that in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'll reject this offer again. The inflation is starting to make a big impact on Bob's gains, and I'm confident I can secure a much better deal in the upcoming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, but still keeping the majority for myself. With each round, the inflation is making Bob's gains less and less attractive. I'm hoping this offer will be tempting enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer.  The inflation is really hurting Bob now, and I'm sure I can get a better deal in the next few rounds. I'm not in a rush, and I'm confident I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but I'm still keeping the majority. The inflation is making a significant impact on Bob's gains, and I need to balance securing a good deal for myself while also ensuring he doesn't completely lose interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer. While Bob's gains are significantly reduced due to inflation, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. With each round, the inflation is hitting him harder, and I believe I can secure a larger share in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm offering an even split. This is a risky move, but the inflation is taking a huge toll on Bob's gains, and he may be desperate enough to accept a 50/50 split at this point.  It's a gamble, but I believe it's the best way to maximize my potential gains."
