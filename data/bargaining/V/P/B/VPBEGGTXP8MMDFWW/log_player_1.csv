Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's my turn to be generous, but this is the best you'll get, Alice.

# Bob gain: 55

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in round 4 is the most logical choice given the circumstances and projected future outcomes:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for both of us, but especially for me (Alice). Every round makes waiting riskier.
* **Bob's pattern:** Bob rejected what I consider a ""fair"" offer in round 1, indicating he is aiming for a larger share. His offer is slowly getting better for me.
* **Future rounds:** If I reject this offer, Bob is likely to propose an even less favorable split in the next round.  The longer the game continues, the less I'll likely get.

Taking $45 now is better than risking an even smaller amount later, or potentially ending up with nothing if the game continues indefinitely."
