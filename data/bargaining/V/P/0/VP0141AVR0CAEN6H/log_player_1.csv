"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit harsh, don't you think? Let's be reasonable. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by letting inflation eat at my potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I propose a 40/60 split,  with you taking 600,000 and me taking 400,000. This is a more balanced approach,  and I believe it's fair given the circumstances.""}
