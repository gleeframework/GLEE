"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll take $500,000 and Bob will take $500,000. This is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
