I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal where I get the majority of the money.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though the inflation means my share is worth less, I'd rather take the guaranteed 5000 than risk losing more money by rejecting and going to another round.  It's a fair split, and I'm happy to take it."
