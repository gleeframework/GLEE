"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose that I get $9000 and Bob gets $1000. This is a fair offer as it accounts for the inflation that will happen if we go into the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a fair deal, as Bob will receive the same amount of money as he would in the previous round, while I get half of what I proposed."
