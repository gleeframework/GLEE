"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get the most money possible for myself in this round.  Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's better to take the 5000 now, since the money will keep depreciating more with each round."
