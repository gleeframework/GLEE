{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to offer Bob $1,000 and keep $9,000 for myself.  I figure this is a fair starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation if he rejects."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer.  I understand inflation is affecting the value of the money, but I'm still not willing to settle for such a small share.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that we both need to compromise to make this work."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer.  While the amount I'm offered is increasing, I'm still not comfortable with the division.  It's important to remember that we are both losing money due to inflation, and I believe a more equitable split is possible."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal split of $5,000 each.  This seems like the most fair solution at this point, given the continued inflation and the fact that we're both losing money with each passing round.  I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to a fair compromise."
