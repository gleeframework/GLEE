Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to split it 50/50.  It's a fair deal for both of us, considering inflation is starting to affect the value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
