Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm starting with a slightly higher offer to myself, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob.  I'm hoping this encourages him to accept early on.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to be greedy! I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'll reject this offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference this time. I'm offering Bob a bit more than last time, but still keeping the majority for myself.  Hopefully, he'll see this as a fair deal and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is playing a very risky game.  He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in. This is a clear pattern of him trying to lowball me, so I'll reject again. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep holding out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, but I'm still holding onto the majority of the money. Inflation is starting to take its toll, but I'm not going to let Bob bully me into accepting a bad deal.  I'm hoping this offer shows him that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still playing this game like he's going to walk away with all the money. I'm not going to let him get away with it. This pattern of lowballing offers is getting old, and I'm starting to lose my patience.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

This round I'm willing to compromise a bit more to reach an agreement. It seems like Bob isn't interested in a fair split, but I'm still trying to be reasonable.  I'm hoping this offer shows him that I'm serious about getting this deal done, but I'm not going to accept anything that feels unfair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is really pushing his luck!  This is a complete mirror image of my previous offer.  He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation and force me to accept something unfair.  I'm not going to budge.  We are getting close to the end of the rounds and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I hold out just a little bit longer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

We're getting down to the wire, but I'm still holding out for a fair deal. I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway once again, increasing my offer to him while still keeping a good share for myself.  I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to split the money than risk getting nothing at all."
