"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $450,000.

I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best option for me, considering the inflation factor. However, it's a good starting point, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
