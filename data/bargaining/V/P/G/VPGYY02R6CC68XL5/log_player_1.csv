"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than before, so I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a good compromise. Considering the reduced value of my gain due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
