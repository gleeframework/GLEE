"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  Since the value of money will decrease in the next round, I'm trying to get the most I can before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less, accepting this offer is still better than rejecting it and risking getting a worse deal in the next round."
