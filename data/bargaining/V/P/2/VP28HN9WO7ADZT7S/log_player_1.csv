"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I want to maximize my gains in the first round to ensure I get as much as possible before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. Even though my gain is worth 20% less than in round 1, it's still better than nothing. I will try to make a better offer in round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I offer an 8000/2000 split in my favor.  While inflation has hit me hard, I'm still aiming for a significant share. Bob seems willing to negotiate, and I believe this offer is fair given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has hit me hard, I'm accepting Bob's offer. My gains are worth 48.8% less than in the first round, but it's better than getting nothing.  It's also likely Bob will continue to offer similar or worse deals in the future, due to the compounding effect of inflation."
