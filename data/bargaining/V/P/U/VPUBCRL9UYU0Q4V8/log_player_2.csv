"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This might seem unfair, but remember, the value of money decreases in each round. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a good deal for Bob, considering the money loses value more quickly for Alice.  While it might seem unfair, it's the best option to get a significant portion of the money before the value decreases too much."
