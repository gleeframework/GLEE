Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split of 9000 for me and 1000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit if Bob feels it's too unbalanced.  It's important for me to get a good portion of the money now, as inflation will affect my share in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's likely that Bob won't budge on his offer. My gains are worth less now due to inflation, and any further rounds will only decrease the value even more. Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the money, and with inflation, the potential gains of future rounds may not be worth the risk."
