"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn was fair, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll think about it carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the total amount is now $9,000. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining $9,000, and keeping 55% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, let's not drag this out. I'll meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting a bit impatient. Considering the offer, I think I can live with it. The money is worth 27.1% less than the initial $10,000, so the total is now $7,273. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair middle ground, and I don't want to risk going to another round."
