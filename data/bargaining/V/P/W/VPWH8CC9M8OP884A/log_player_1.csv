"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'm feeling greedy today. I'll take a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth less for me, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to make up for the lost value due to inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share while keeping a bit more for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to make up for inflation, but I'm still not convinced. I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the significant loss in value.

However, Bob's offer is a significant decrease from my previous offers, and I'm not sure if I should push for more or accept this offer to avoid further losses.

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit worried about the value of the money, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. This is my best offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and protecting my own interests. With the money being worth less and less each round, I need to be careful not to give away too much. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
