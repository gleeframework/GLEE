"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100, and I'll take the remaining $60, which is 60% of the original $100. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is fair.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants a more equitable split, but it looks like his offer is actually the same as my initial offer, just with the labels swapped.

I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $40, and Bob will take $60. I'm hoping we can wrap up the game now!"
