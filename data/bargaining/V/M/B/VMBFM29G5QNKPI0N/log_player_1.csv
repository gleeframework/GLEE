Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but I'm confident we can find a more equitable split. Let's reverse roles â€“ I'm willing to accept the slightly smaller share to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
