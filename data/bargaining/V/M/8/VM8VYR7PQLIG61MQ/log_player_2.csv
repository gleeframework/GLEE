"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is generous, but I'm going to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split this fairly.  I'm willing to take a little less to ensure we both get something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking losing everything due to inflation.  Let's end this here."
