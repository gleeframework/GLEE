**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The money is losing value rapidly. Each round makes a significant dent in the overall payout for both of us.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is likely to dig in further, and with the value dropping faster for him, he's feeling the pressure. Holding out *might* force a better offer, but it's a gamble.
* **Current Offer vs. Future Uncertainty:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a decent amount. Rejecting it risks a lower offer in the next round where the value will be even lower. 

It's a tough decision, but in a negotiation with rapidly diminishing returns, sometimes securing a reasonable gain is the best strategy."
