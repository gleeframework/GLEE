"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, my turn! I understand the inflation pressure, but your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - this offer gives me a larger share while still leaving you with a decent amount.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is working against you.  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.  Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offers have been more than generous, considering I'm the one facing inflation. This is my final offer - take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the final offer I'm willing to make.  It's clear you're feeling the pressure of inflation, and this offer is more than fair given the circumstances. Take it now before the deal gets any worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's better to accept a less-than-ideal offer now than risk getting an even worse offer later when the inflation has eaten away more of my potential gains.
