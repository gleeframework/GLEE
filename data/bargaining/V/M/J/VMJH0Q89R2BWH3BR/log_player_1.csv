"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal that's hard to refuse. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. This is a pretty generous offer, considering the game is just starting and the money is still worth its full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. Since Bob is proposing a 50-50 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate for more in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round. Considering this, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000. This way, I'll be able to maintain a slightly higher share of the total amount, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. In this round, the money I gain is worth only 72.9% of its original value. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

Since Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, and the money is worth less, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for more in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now, with a total decrease of 37.1% from its original value. Considering this, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, and I'll take the remaining $550,000. This way, I'll be able to maintain a slightly higher share of the total amount, considering the decreasing value of the money."
