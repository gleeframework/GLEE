Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the lion's share""}

I'm proposing that I receive 800,000 and Bob receives 200,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation we'll both face. Let's call it a day and move on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve more given my initial proposal""}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
