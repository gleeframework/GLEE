"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4000 * 0.8 = $3200. And Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $6000 * 0.95 = $5700.

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair deal""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains in this round:

My gain of $5200 is worth 52% of what it was in the first round, which is $5200 / 0.52 = $10000 * 0.52 = $5200. 
Bob's gain of $4800 is worth 86.74% of what it was in the first round, which is $4800 / 0.8644 = $10,000 * 0.8644 = $8644.

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
