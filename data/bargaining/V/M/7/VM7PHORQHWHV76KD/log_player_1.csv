"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still a fair and reasonable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 55/45 is a good enough split for me. I was hoping for a more equal division, especially since I'm the one who made the first offer. I'd like to keep negotiating and see if we can find a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle. 50/50 seems like a fair and reasonable split.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and meet Bob halfway. A 50/50 split is a good compromise, and I hope Bob will accept this offer."
