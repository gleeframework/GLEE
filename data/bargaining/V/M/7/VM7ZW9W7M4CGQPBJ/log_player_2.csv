Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I think we can do better than your previous offer. Let's split it more evenly. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Consider that if you reject this, the money will be worth less in the next round.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's split it 60/40.  Remember, if you reject, we both lose out due to inflation.  This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical decision. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value rapidly. Waiting any longer significantly diminishes returns for both of us.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Rejecting this offer in hopes of getting a slightly better deal in Round 4 is too risky. The 10% inflation means even a 50/50 split in Round 4 would be worth less than the current 60/40 offer from Alice. 

It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting even less later."
