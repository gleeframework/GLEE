Let's see if Bob will take the tiny piece! ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd love to try and get a bigger share, it's not worth risking losing everything due to inflation. 500,000 is a good amount, and I don't want to be greedy."
