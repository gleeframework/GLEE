"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less than before, but still more than half 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is compromising slightly, it's important to remain firm in the negotiation. Accepting a less than even split, even with the pressure of inflation, sets a bad precedent. There's still time to negotiate a fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but I need a bigger share than last time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer to half, but still in my favor 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** The pressure of inflation is mounting. While not ideal, Alice is inching closer to a 50/50 split. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable, albeit slightly smaller due to inflation, amount rather than risking a worse offer or even nothing as the rounds progress."
