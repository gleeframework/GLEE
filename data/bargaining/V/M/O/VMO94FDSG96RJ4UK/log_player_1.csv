I'm going for a large share, but leaving a little for Bob to make him more likely to accept in the first round. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 50% now rather than risk getting nothing in the end. I'm not sure what Bob is thinking, but I'll take the sure thing."
