I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I want to be as fair as possible in the first round, but I also want to secure a large share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm reducing my share slightly but still keeping the majority. Bob seems intent on taking most of the money, so I'll try to offer him a bit more to see if he'll accept."
