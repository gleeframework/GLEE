Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers still heavily favor her despite the rapid devaluation of the money.  While a deal is important, holding out for one more round is worth the risk to signal I won't accept an unfair deal.  There's a chance Alice will significantly improve her offer in Round 6 due to the time pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  We're running out of time and the money is losing value fast.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point. Let's take it before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

By round 6, the pressure is immense due to the rapidly decreasing value.  Alice has consistently shown a desire for a larger share, but the changing circumstances necessitate a more pragmatic approach.  A 50/50 split is the cleanest and fairest deal, and it sends a clear message that I'm serious about reaching an agreement before time runs out.  There's a chance Alice might reject this too, hoping for me to concede further in desperation, but the risk of getting nothing at all is too high at this stage."
