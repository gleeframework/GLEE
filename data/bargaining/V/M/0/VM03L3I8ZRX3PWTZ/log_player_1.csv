"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me now, I'm considering Bob's offer carefully.

Since I would gain 40 dollars, which is worth 90% of the original 50 dollars I would have gotten in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about this offer.

However, it's still a better option than proceeding to the next round and risking further erosion of the value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
