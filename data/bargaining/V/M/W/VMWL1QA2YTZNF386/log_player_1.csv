"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor.  It's a generous offer considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair offer considering the inflation. Accepting ensures I get something, while rejecting risks getting nothing in later rounds."
