"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide the money equally, each receiving $500,000. This ensures fairness in our distribution considering the diminishing value of money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
