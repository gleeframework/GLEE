"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my proposal is now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too skewed towards you. I'll try to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I'm still giving up too much. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the initial 60-40 proposal""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the original 60-40 split, but still takes into account Bob's insistence on a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55-45 is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, my proposal is now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still a bit too skewed towards you, but I'm willing to keep negotiating.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think 55-45 is still not a fair split, considering the initial proposal and the fact that the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you at 48-52, but I think I deserve a bit more given the current value of the money""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50-50 split, considering the effects of inflation."
