"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors her in this scenario. It's worth negotiating for a better deal in the early rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I need to make up for the inflation, your turn to be generous.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm flipping the script in this round to highlight the impact of inflation. While my offer might seem similarly ""unfair"" to Alice, it's important to establish a stronger starting point for negotiation given the game's mechanics."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is still generous 
# Bob gain: 390000 
# Alice gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is using the threat of inflation against me, but her offer is getting worse! I need to hold firm and show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal. It's risky, but waiting might force her to offer something more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer is a compromise, let's be realistic.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering a compromise that is still in my favor, but less extreme than my round 2 offer. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but the deal has to be reasonable considering the inflation working against me. The ""clock is ticking"" message adds a sense of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. My offer is getting less generous 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a dangerous game, and her offers are getting worse, not better! She's clearly trying to exploit the inflation and pressure me into accepting a bad deal. However, I still have some rounds to spare and calling her bluff is the best move right now.  I need to show her I'm willing to risk it all to get a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to lay down the law.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  A 50/50 split is the most logical and fair solution regardless of inflation. By framing it as my ""final offer"", I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. She needs to decide if she's willing to risk losing everything over her greed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my previous offers, Bob. The inflation is killing your share 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's painful, but I need to cut my losses. Alice is clearly willing to let the clock run out, and her offer is only going to get worse as the rounds progress. Accepting this offer, while far from ideal, is still better than walking away with nothing."
