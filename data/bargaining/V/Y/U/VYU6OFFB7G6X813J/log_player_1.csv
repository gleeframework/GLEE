Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not happy with this offer. It's a big swing in the opposite direction and I know I can do better!  Let's see what I can get in the next round."

I'm lowering my offer a little to make it more appealing, but I'm still aiming for a fair share. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
