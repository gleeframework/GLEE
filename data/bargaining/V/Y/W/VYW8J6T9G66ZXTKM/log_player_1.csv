"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, but I'm not willing to give you more than 50% 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

In this round, the money is worth 80% of its original value, so my gain of 5000 is actually worth 4000 in original value. Bob's gain of 5000 is worth 4500 in original value.

Considering the reduced value, I think this offer is a bit stingy from Bob's side, given that I'm getting 4000 in original value. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 64% of its original value (80% * 80% = 64%). I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something in return""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up more than 70% 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

In this round, the money is worth 64% of its original value, so my gain of 3000 is actually worth 1920 in original value. Bob's gain of 7000 is worth 5600 in original value.

Considering the reduced value, I think this offer is still quite generous from Bob's side, and I'm willing to accept it.
