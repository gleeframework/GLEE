"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you can do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is worth 10% less than the original amount, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

Bob's offer: $6000
Actual value: $6000 / (1 - 0.10) = $6666.67

I'll also calculate the actual value of my gain:

Alice's gain: $4000
Actual value: $4000

Considering the actual values, I'll decide:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I'll wait for a better one!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you can still do better!""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting $5500 and Bob getting $4500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer:

Bob's offer: $5500
Actual value: $5500 / (1 - 0.271) = $6666.67

I'll also calculate the actual value of my gain:

Alice's gain: $4500
Actual value: $4500

Considering the actual values, I'll decide:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I'll wait for a better one!

Note: I'm still hoping to get a better deal, considering the actual values are still decreasing due to inflation."
