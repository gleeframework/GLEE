"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think 80% is still a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... 

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 50%), I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the inflation.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 32% is a fair share considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small consolation prize, but I think 90% is the best I can do considering the inflation and the initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... 

I'll reject this offer. I don't think 10% is a fair consolation prize, considering the original 50-50 split.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 32% of its original value now (80% of 40%), I'll aim for an even higher percentage to account for the inflation.
