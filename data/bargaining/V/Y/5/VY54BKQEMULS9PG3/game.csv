5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, let's be fair and efficient. I propose a 52/48 split in my favor.  This leaves us both with a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, your offer was a good starting point. However, considering the inflation, I need a slightly larger share to make it worthwhile to accept in this round. How about a 53/47 split in my favor?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, time is running out and inflation is working against us. My previous offer was already generous, but I'm willing to compromise slightly. Let's settle this now with a 51/49 split in my favor.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. I understand your position, but a 50/50 split just isn't feasible with the inflation working against me. I'm offering you the same amount you initially offered me -  a 52/48 split, but this time in my favor. Let's wrap this up.",Bob,4,

5050.0,4950.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're letting greed get in the way of a reasonable deal. I'm offering a 50.5/49.5 split - just slightly in my favor. Take it or leave it, but the deal won't get any better for you.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4900.0,5100.0,"Alice, I'm starting to think you enjoy playing this game more than making a deal!  I understand your position, but my position is not unreasonable considering the time pressure and inflation. This is my final offer -  a 51/49 split in my favor. If you reject this, I'm sticking to my guns and won't accept anything less than 50/50 moving forward.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, I'm going to make this easy for both of us: 50/50.  I'm tired of this game, and I'm sure you are too. Let's stop wasting time and take the fair deal while it's still on the table.",Alice,7,
