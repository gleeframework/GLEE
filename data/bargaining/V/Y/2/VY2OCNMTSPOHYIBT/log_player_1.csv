"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, my initial reaction is that this offer is even more skewed towards Bob's favor. However, I'll have to consider the fact that the game is still in its early stages and I might be able to negotiate a better deal in future rounds.

For now, I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping to increase the chances of a deal."
