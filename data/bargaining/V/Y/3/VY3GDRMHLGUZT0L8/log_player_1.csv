"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob a relatively smaller share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% * 90% = 81%). I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
