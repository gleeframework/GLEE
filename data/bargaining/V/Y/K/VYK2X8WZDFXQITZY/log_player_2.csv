"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor, Bob. It's a strong opening offer considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a good starting point, but 60/40 is a bit too skewed in Alice's favor, and there's a lot of time left to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll accept a 55/45 split, but in my favor this time. We're losing money with each round! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I'm starting to feel the pressure from inflation, I still believe there's room for a better deal. 55/45 in Alice's favor is too close to her original offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a fairer split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's cut the middle ground. A 50/50 split is the fairest solution considering the rapidly decreasing value of our money. We both get a decent share without further delay.""}
