"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since my gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less, which is a bigger hit. Given that I'm already starting with a lower offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept this compromise.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, but still keeping in mind the diminishing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! With my gain being worth 27.1% less, I'll have to be cautious. However, Bob's gain is worth a significant 48.8% less, which is a substantial hit.

Considering the extreme difference in the value of our gains, I'll accept this offer.
