"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more equitable split, considering the potential for inflation.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split, especially since I'm not sure how much inflation will affect Bob's end of the deal. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is a more reasonable split for me.""}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal by proposing a 55/45 split, where I get a bit more than Bob."
