"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair proposal, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70, you can have 30. It's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 30 is actually worth 30 * 0.95 = 28.5.

I'm not sure if 28.5 is a fair deal, especially considering Bob is getting 70, which is worth 70 * 0.95 = 66.5. That's a significant difference.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 60, but I need 40 to cover the inflation""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80, you can have 20. I'm not going to give you all the money! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is being aggressive!

Let's calculate the value of my gain in Round 1: 50 * 0.85 * 0.95 * 0.929 (1 - 0.071 = 0.071, 1 - 0.071 = 0.929) = 37.52

Considering the inflation, my gain of 20 is actually worth 20 * 0.929 = 18.58.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept Bob's offer.
