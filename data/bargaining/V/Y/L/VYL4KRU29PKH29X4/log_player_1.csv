"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal is a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $5000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is still a significant amount. I'll accept this offer.
