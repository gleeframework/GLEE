Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that.  Let's find a solution where we both benefit more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game goes on, the more value the money loses. Waiting for a potentially better offer in later rounds is risky because the inflation will significantly diminish the value of any potential gains.
* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to a more balanced split compared to her first offer. This suggests she's willing to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer and hoping for a significantly better deal in later rounds is very risky. Alice may not budge much further, and the inflation will continuously erode the value of the money.

**Taking the deal in Round 3 guarantees Bob a reasonable sum, even after considering the inflation.** It's a safer bet than gambling on potentially better but increasingly less valuable offers in future rounds."
