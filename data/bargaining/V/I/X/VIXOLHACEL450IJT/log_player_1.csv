"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to make a more advantageous offer. Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% less from the first round, and another 20% from the second round), I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating away at my potential gain, I'll try to hold out for a better deal. The offer from Bob seems a bit more generous than my previous offer, but I'm not convinced it's the best I can get.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth 68.8% less than in the first round now (20% less in the first round, 20% less in the second round, and 8.8% less in the third round, and another 20% less in the fourth round). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the significant decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. With the money being worth only 32.77% of its original value, I'll have to be careful. However, Bob's offer seems quite one-sided, and I'm not sure I want to give up so much.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 6.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth only 32.77% of its original value, I'll have to be very aggressive in my offer. I'll try to get as much as possible, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000
}
```"
