"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want the majority. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round.  Since the money is worth less for her each round, she may be more willing to give up a larger share in order to avoid the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the money is worth less for you each round.  Let's end this before it gets even more complicated.""
