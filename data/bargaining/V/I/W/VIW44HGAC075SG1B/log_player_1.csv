"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly. I'm willing to give you a bit more than half, but let's start with a more balanced proposition. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
