"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm keeping the majority of the money, but I'm willing to compromise to get the game started. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess my decision.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining money, Bob. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 60/40 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This split is more balanced, but I'm still not giving up too much.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming to keep a slight edge in the division. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving in, but I'll meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! The money is worth less and less with each passing round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I suppose we're at a stalemate, Bob. I'll accept your offer. It's not ideal, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less valuable money.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, but I'm not happy about it. I was hoping for a better deal, but the reduced value of the money makes it harder to be picky."
