# Bob's message: Your share will only shrink with time, Alice. Let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While it seems appealing at first, I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself. The money I gain is worth less in each round, so I need to be strategic."
