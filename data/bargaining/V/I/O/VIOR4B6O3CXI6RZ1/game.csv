7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair balance considering the decreasing value of money over time.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"I'm not convinced by your first offer. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split given the current value of money.",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a reasonable balance while acknowledging the diminishing value of money over time.",Alice,3,

4000.0,6000.0,"I'm not willing to give you the majority of the share. I think 60/40 is too skewed in your favor, considering the value of money is decreasing.",Bob,4,
