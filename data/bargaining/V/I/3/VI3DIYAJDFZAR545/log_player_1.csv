"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a generous offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can start with a good relationship. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $50 is now worth 20% less than what I would have gotten in the first round. However, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
