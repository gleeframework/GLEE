# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a significant toll on my potential gains, my share of $5 is now worth a tiny fraction of what it was initially. Bob's offer is extremely one-sided, and I'm starting to worry that I might end up with almost nothing. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

Here's my proposal:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Fine, take it all. I'm done.""
