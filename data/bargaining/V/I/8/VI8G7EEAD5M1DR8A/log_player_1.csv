Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away at your share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer might seem generous on the surface, it's important to remember that the value of the money decreases for me with each round.  Accepting $4,500 now is a bad deal compared to potentially securing a larger share in a future round, even with inflation. I need to aim for a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob, and it's disappearing quickly!  This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to push Bob to make a decision and avoid further rounds where the value of my potential gain diminishes.
* **Slight Concession:**  I've shifted the offer slightly in Bob's favor from my initial 60/40 split to a 55/45 split. It's a small concession but might be enough to get him to accept, especially with the added pressure of the ""final offer"" statement. 
* **Inflation Factor:** While this offer gives Bob a slightly larger portion than my initial offer, it's important to remember that due to inflation,  $5,500 now is worth more to me than a potentially larger sum in later rounds."
