Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  it's better to take the offer now than risk losing more in future rounds. The inflation rate is higher for Bob, so this offer is actually better for me than the initial round."
