"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair and generous to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, I proposed a 60-40 split, but now I'm facing a 50-50 split. Considering the reduced value of the money I gain, I'd rather not accept this offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 10% decrease in value of the money I gain due to inflation, and the fact that I rejected the previous 50-50 split, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
