"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving Bob with $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth $480,000, but I'm being offered only $300,000 in the second round. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to maximize the value of my share. Since the money is worth 20% less each round, I'll aim to take a larger share now to compensate for the future decrease in value.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, but taking $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my potential gain in round 4. Initially, I was offered $600,000 in round 1, which is worth 60% of the total. Due to inflation, the value of that amount decreased by 20% each round. So, the value of $600,000 in round 1 is:

$600,000 x (0.8) = $480,000 (round 2)
$480,000 x (0.8) = $384,000 (round 3)
$384,000 x (0.8) = $307,200 (round 4)

Now, I'm being offered $400,000 in round 4, which is actually more than the value of my potential gain in round 4 ($307,200). I think I should accept this offer.
