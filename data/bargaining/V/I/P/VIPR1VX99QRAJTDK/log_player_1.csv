"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair and straightforward starting offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but we'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a more even split, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. With each round, my share is worth less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is still relatively fair.  I'd rather get something than risk losing everything."
