"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will take it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth less than my initial gain of $900,000.

I'll think for a moment... I don't like the idea of giving Bob $800,000, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
