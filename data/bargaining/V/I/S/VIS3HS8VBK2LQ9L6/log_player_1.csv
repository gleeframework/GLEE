Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, I'll reject it.

# Bob gain: 550000
