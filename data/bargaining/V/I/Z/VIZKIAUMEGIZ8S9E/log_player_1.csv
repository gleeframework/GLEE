"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it evenly, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about splitting it evenly, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
