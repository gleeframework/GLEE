"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a closer split, I'm still not convinced it's the best I can get, given the inflation and the fact that I'm losing more value with each round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gain, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800

# Bob gain: 5500

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
