I'm taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just a dollar.  It's a bit cheeky, but I want to see if he'll accept it or fight for a better deal!  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much fairer offer, and it's a good deal for me. I'll accept it!"
