"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a greedy approach and offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  I'm aware of inflation, but I want to maximize my gains early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's a significant increase from the first round, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. The inflation is hurting Bob more than me, and I'm going to try to leverage that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still try to keep a large portion of the money. The inflation is hurting Bob, and I'm hoping he'll accept this offer before it gets even worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's disappointing to only receive 400,000, Bob's offer represents a significant gain for me. The inflation has drastically decreased the value of the money Bob gains, making his offer much more appealing. It's a good strategy to accept now, as the value of the money for both of us is likely to continue decreasing in the future rounds."
