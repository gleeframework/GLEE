I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a classic ultimatum game scenario. I will reject Bob's offer because it is significantly less favorable than my initial offer, even though there is inflation. I believe I can secure a better outcome by making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but still keeping a significant share for myself. I'm hoping that Bob will see the potential for further rounds and realize that rejecting my offer could lead to a worse outcome for him."
