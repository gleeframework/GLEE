"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is an extremely unfair offer. Even though it's the first round, there's no reason to accept such a small share.  Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""This is a fair offer, considering the next few rounds will mean significant losses for both of us. Let's end this game with a reasonable split.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. This is the fairest solution in the long run, as we both lose money with every round. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, especially given that with each round, we'll both lose more money. It's a good compromise to secure half the money before the inflation gets even worse."
