I'm Bob, and I'm feeling greedy! I'll try to get more than 40%.  Let's see what Alice offers next."

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a bigger share, especially since the money is losing value for Alice more quickly than for me.  I'll see what she offers next."

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Let's try a 65-35 split.  With each round, the money is losing value faster for you.  I'm willing to compromise, but this seems like a good deal for both of us.""}

# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the offer is tempting, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I know the inflation is hitting Alice hard, but I'm going to try to squeeze out a little more."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""With each round, the money is worth less for you.  I'm willing to give you 30%, but I need to get 70% to make this worthwhile for me.  This is my final offer.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll try to meet you halfway one last time, despite the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm going to accept this offer. The inflation is really starting to bite for Alice, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all if we run out of time. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
