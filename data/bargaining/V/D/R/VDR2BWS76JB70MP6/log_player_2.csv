"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation impact on my side. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. We both lose with inflation. I'll take a little more, but it's a better deal than you'll get in later rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer still stands.  We can end this now and both benefit, or risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very stubborn, but her offer still heavily favors her. While the effects of inflation are increasing, holding out for a better deal is still the best option for Bob.  Alice's offer is getting worse with each round, and she'll likely become more desperate as we get closer to the 12 round limit."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a compromise. You're focusing too much on the initial numbers and not enough on the fact we BOTH lose if this fails.  Let's be realistic.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you halfway. This is a fair deal considering the inflation we both face. Let's end this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now much closer to a reasonable split.  More importantly, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. Accepting a slightly less favorable deal now is better than risking getting nothing if we approach round 12."
