"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is worth 10% less than what he could have had in the first round, I think he's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm not convinced that I deserve only 40% of the total amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a fair deal""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous, but not too generous, since I think I deserve a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4800, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this new offer from Bob.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a bit more generous than his previous one, taking into account that his gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. I'm not sure if I want to give him a larger share, but I also don't want to reject the offer and risk him making an even worse one next time.

I'll accept this offer.
