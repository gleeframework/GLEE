"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still getting the better end of it 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200
Bob gain: 6000 * 0.8 = 4800

I'm not thrilled with the deal, but it's a slight improvement from the previous offer. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations.
