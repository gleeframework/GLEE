"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  It's important to reach an agreement quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's offer isn't quite fair in my opinion, and I think we can find a better compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out! This is my final offer. Let's be practical and end this before inflation hurts us both even more. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation and Alice's assertion that this is her final offer, accepting this proposal seems like the most pragmatic decision to ensure I receive a significant portion of the money before its value decreases further."
