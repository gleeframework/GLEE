Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fair but slightly advantageous offer for myself. I want to see how Bob reacts and whether he's willing to negotiate or not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair, and while the inflation is hurting me, I'm not willing to accept such a low amount. I'll try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the first round, aiming for a more equitable split. This should hopefully make Bob reconsider his previous proposal and start negotiating more seriously."
