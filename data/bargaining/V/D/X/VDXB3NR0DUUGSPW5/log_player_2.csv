Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to look out for myself too.  This is a compromise, take it before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting closer to a range I'd find acceptable, I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds.  The inflation is hurting, but settling for a poor deal would hurt more in the long run.  I'm hoping Alice will get more anxious as we get closer to the deadline and offer a larger share."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! This is my last offer above 550,000.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one. Alice is clearly getting anxious and trying to pressure me. However, accepting this offer means I lose out on a significant amount compared to the initial rounds. I'm willing to bet she'll crack under the pressure of the approaching deadline and offer a better deal."
