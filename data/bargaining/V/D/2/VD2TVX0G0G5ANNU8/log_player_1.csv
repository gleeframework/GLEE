Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this gives Bob a decent starting point, and I'll be able to secure a good chunk of the money right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money. The inflation is a significant factor, and I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round."
