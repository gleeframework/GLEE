Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should take this before the money devalues further 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is using the shrinking pot as leverage, but her offer is still significantly skewed in her favor.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, so it's time to start getting more assertive to avoid getting stuck with a much worse deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 53,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, time is on my side 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, hoping the inflation will force me to accept a bad offer. However, her offer is barely budging. I need to show I'm serious and willing to risk it all to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 51,
""alice_gain"": 49,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.  We both lose if we don't agree now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's getting very risky now. While I want a better deal than Alice is offering, I need to make a concession to avoid losing everything.  This offer is close to even and gives a slight edge to me, but framing it as non-negotiable might push Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm not 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  I'm playing chicken and I just blinked.  Alice is calling my bluff and with only 3 rounds left, the inflation will severely eat into any potential gains, even if I could get Alice to agree to a more favorable split. It's a disappointing outcome, but better than walking away with nothing."
