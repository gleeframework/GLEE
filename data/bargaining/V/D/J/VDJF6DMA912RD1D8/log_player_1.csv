"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $45, which is a bit less than half, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer since it's a relatively fair split, and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is intended to convey a sense of reasonableness and cooperation.\n\n###\n\nNow it's your turn as the game master to relay Bob's response. Will he accept my offer or make a counteroffer?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a slightly better split for me this time, considering the money loses value with each round. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even considering the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal. Since the money loses value with each round, I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise in the next round to avoid further losses. Additionally, accepting 40% of the original amount after just two rounds seems too low for me. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and get a more favorable split.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'm making a slightly more generous offer to him this time. By proposing a 52-48 split, I'm hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and fairness. The message ""Let's meet in the middle"" is intended to convey a willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution. Since the money is losing value with each round, I believe this offer is reasonable and might be more appealing to Bob than risking further losses.\n\n###\n\nWill Bob accept this offer or make another counteroffer?"
