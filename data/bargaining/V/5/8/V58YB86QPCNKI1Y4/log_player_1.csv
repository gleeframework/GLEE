I'm proposing that I get 45% of the remaining $100, which is $45, and Bob gets the remaining 55%, which is $55. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I'll take the lead now 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the reduced value of my potential winnings, I'm not willing to give up as much as Bob is asking for. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive again, I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer to take back some control.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking control, you're running out of time 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential winnings!

Considering the reduced value of my potential winnings and the fact that I'm running out of time, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While I'm not thrilled about giving up 90%, I don't want to risk getting nothing if I reject this offer and Bob makes a better one in the next round.
