Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  Inflation is hitting us both, so a 50/50 split seems the fairest way to go now.  It's a fresh start, and we can both get something out of this deal. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
