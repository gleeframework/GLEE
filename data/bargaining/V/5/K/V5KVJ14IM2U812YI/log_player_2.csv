"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems reasonable for a first round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, how about a compromise? 57% for me and 43% for you.  It's closer to my initial offer, but acknowledges the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The time pressure is hurting Alice more than me due to the faster depreciation. It's worth holding out for a better offer in the next round."

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, Bob. 55/45 split - it's fair considering the time remaining and the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is rapidly eating into the potential gains. While Alice's offer is not ideal, it's better to accept a less favorable deal now than risk getting nothing in later rounds. At this point, securing a reasonable amount is more important than holding out for a slightly better split."
