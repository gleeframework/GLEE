"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a classic ""take it or leave it"" approach, hoping Bob will accept a small amount to avoid getting nothing at all.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting each other's proposals.  Let's take it!"
