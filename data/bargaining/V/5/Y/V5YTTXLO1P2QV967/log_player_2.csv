Alice's offer:

It's tempting to push for more, but accepting is the safest option at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer this goes on, the less the money is worth. Accepting a slightly smaller share now is better than potentially getting nothing if we fail to agree.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice seems firm and her offer is now reasonable. It's unlikely she'll concede much more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a 48/52 split in later rounds risks getting nothing at all. A 45/55 split, while not ideal, guarantees a decent sum."
