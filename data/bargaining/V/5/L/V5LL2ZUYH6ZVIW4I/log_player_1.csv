"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 30% of the remaining value. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the current value of the money due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation. Let's find a fair compromise.""
