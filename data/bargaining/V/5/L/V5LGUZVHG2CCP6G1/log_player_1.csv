``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I figure it's a good starting point, and since I'm the one making the offer, I'm going to try to get the lion's share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While I'm not thrilled about the 20% inflation, I still think I can get a better deal than 1000 dollars. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher amount in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  I'll offer 8000 for myself and 2000 for Bob.  Inflation is a factor, but I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer."

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While the inflation is making things more difficult, I'm still hoping to get a better deal than 2000. I'm going to try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer 6000 for myself and 4000 for Bob. Inflation is really starting to bite now, so I need to be more realistic.  I'm hoping this offer shows Bob that I'm serious about dividing the money fairly, while still getting a decent portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While I'm feeling the pinch of inflation, I'm not willing to accept a deal where Bob gets a significantly larger share than me.  I'm going to try to negotiate a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split. The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I need to make sure I get something out of this.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point, considering the rapidly diminishing value of the money."
