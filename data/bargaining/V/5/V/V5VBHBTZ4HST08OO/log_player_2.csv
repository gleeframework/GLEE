Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit unfair to me. How about this split instead?""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting would have given me significantly less than half the money. It made sense to reject and counter-propose.
* **My Counter Offer:**
    * I'm aiming for a slightly more advantageous split than a simple 50/50.  
    * Alice's money is devaluing faster than mine, so she has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement quickly. 
    * By offering a bit more than I'd ultimately settle for, I leave room for negotiation if she counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway from my initial offer, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unfavorable:** While Alice has moved towards a more even split, her offer still heavily favors her. 
* **Inflation Advantage:** The inflation is working in my favor. Her offer is getting worse for her over time, while mine remains the same value to me.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I have leverage to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and the deal is getting worse for you. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my initial demand slightly (from $550,000 to $520,000), showing a willingness to compromise, but only a little.
* **Deadline Pressure:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency. This could pressure Alice to accept before the deal potentially gets worse for her in future rounds.
* **Favorable Split:**  Even with the slight concession, the split is still in my favor. The ongoing inflation means that delaying further is riskier for Alice than it is for me."
