"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's a seemingly fair offer, Bob should reject it. There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better split in the next round, but due to the inflation, Bob's potential gains will be significantly lower if he waits. It's worth the risk to see if Alice will offer a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous! How about a 70-30 split in my favor? This way, we both get something good, and we can end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. How about a 45-55 split? We can both take a decent chunk and move on. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob might be tempted to hold out for a better deal, the inflation has taken a significant bite out of his potential gains.  Accepting the offer now secures a decent sum, even with the reduced value. There's a chance Alice might offer a more favorable deal in the next round, but the risk of further inflation makes this offer the safer choice."
