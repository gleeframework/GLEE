"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor, knowing that Bob has no idea about the inflation effect.  He might just accept it, but I'm prepared for him to reject it and counter-propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My money is worth 5% less this round, and it will continue to decrease with each passing round.
* **Bob's Knowledge:** I don't know if Bob is aware of the inflation impact on me, but he is likely to be aware of the inflation impact on his own gains.  He is likely to make increasingly favorable proposals for himself in the future. 
* **Time Limit:** With only 12 rounds, we are quickly approaching a situation where we might both get nothing.

While this offer is less than ideal, it guarantees me a significant share of the money.  Rejecting it risks a much worse outcome."
