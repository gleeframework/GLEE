"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer.  I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  This way, if he rejects, I have plenty of rounds to adjust my offer and still get a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair. While his gain is only 5% less than before, my gain is now 20% less. I'm not going to accept this offer. I still have 10 rounds left and can try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to try to strike a more balanced offer. I'll take 75% and leave Bob with 25%.  This seems like a fair deal, especially considering the inflation we're both facing. Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
