I propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. I think it's a fair starting point considering I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is worse than the 90/10 split I offered in the first round. Even with inflation, the 250,000 I would get is less than 900,000 * 0.95.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to propose a 70/30 split.  This is still a decent amount for me, and hopefully, it's enough to convince Bob to accept the offer. The inflation is starting to become a real factor, and I don't want to risk losing too much more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough.  Even with the inflation, I can still get a better deal if we keep playing.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. We're both getting a good amount, and I think we're both starting to understand that the inflation is quickly diminishing the value of the money.  This seems like a fair and logical compromise."
