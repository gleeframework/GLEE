"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. This offer won't be as good for you in future rounds due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a more equitable split this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you value the money, but it loses value with every round.  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.  
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The value for you is rapidly decreasing.  Take this offer and get something before it's practically worthless! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, taking the offer is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The money is losing value for me at an alarming rate (almost 60% less than the first round). 
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice's offer will improve in future rounds, and waiting means risking even less money.
* **""Bird in Hand"" Principle:** It's better to accept a less than ideal offer now than to risk getting nothing and losing even more value. 

While $4,000 is less than what I aimed for, it's significantly better than waiting and potentially receiving a much lower offer, or even nothing at all."
