"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a significant amount, and I'm taking $60 for myself. I've included a message saying ""Let's be reasonable"" to convey that I'm open to negotiations, but I'm also confident in the fairness of my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good starting point and we can work from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer to split the money evenly may seem fair at first glance, I need to consider the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less in this round, accepting this offer would mean I'm getting less value than if we had split it evenly in the first round. I'm also aware that we have 10 more rounds to negotiate, so I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a better deal. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to create an opportunity for a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $42 and taking $58 for myself. Given that the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's even split. By acknowledging the impact of inflation in my message, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to adapt and find a mutually beneficial solution. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money."
