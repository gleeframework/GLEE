I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not getting the majority of the money, it's better to accept this offer.  The inflation is hurting my potential gains, and it's likely Bob will offer me even less in future rounds."
