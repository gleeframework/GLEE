"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'll give you a small share, but I'll take the majority! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like Bob's tone, but I'll consider the offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to negotiate better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
