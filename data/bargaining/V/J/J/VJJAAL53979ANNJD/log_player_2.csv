"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share without risking too much.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 50/50 split is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation. Since the money is worth less in each round, it's best to try and secure a larger share early on."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
