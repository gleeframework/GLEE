"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous. Take 350000 and let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing, but I'm still in a good position!

I'll think for a moment... and decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's being generous is genuine or if he's just trying to get me to accept a worse deal. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal for myself.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You were generous last round, but I'm not feeling so charitable now. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share, but still trying to get a better deal for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
