"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, fair and square! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 650000,
  ""alice_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous. Take 350,000 and let's move on!"" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You were generous last round, but I'm not feeling so charitable now. Meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to hold out for more, the inflation is starting to hurt. 580,000 is still a good chunk of change, and I don't want to risk getting less in the next round."
