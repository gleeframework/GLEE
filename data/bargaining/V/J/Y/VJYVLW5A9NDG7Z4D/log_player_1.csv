"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'd rather get more money in this round to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time to account for the decrease in value. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly biased split, with me getting a slightly larger share to make up for the lost value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money being worth 48.8% less than the original amount, I need to be more cautious and think about the long-term consequences.

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll have to prioritize getting a larger share now to make up for the future losses. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

After some thought, I'll accept this offer.
