"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more equitable split, Alice. Let's make sure we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is heavily skewed in Bob's favor, and the inflation is working against me.  I need to incentivize him to take a deal sooner rather than later. I'll reject and propose something slightly better for him in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""This is a generous offer, Bob, and time is running out. Let's settle this now."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer needs a counter:** Bob offered me 400,000 which, with inflation, is getting less appealing. I need to counter with something that looks better to him but doesn't completely gut my potential gains.
* **Slight improvement for Bob:** Offering 480,000 to Bob is a noticeable increase from his previous offer, making it more likely he'll consider it seriously.
* **Time pressure:**  I'm emphasizing the time pressure with each round. Every round that passes makes the deal worse for me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  This offer is a good compromise to ensure we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Bob is clearly trying to wear me down, and the inflation is really starting to bite.  While his offer isn't great, accepting now might be better than risking getting even less later. 

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could hold out hoping Bob will offer more, there's a real risk he'll lowball me even further in later rounds. The longer this goes on, the more I lose due to inflation.
* **Guaranteed Gains:** Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable sum (even with inflation). Rejecting means potentially getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 
* **Bob's Strategy:**  Bob's offers haven't changed drastically, suggesting he's aiming for a slow and steady win. Accepting now might be the best way to cut my losses and secure a decent portion of the money."
