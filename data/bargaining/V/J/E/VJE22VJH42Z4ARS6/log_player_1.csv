"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of $50 is worth 20% less than the $60 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $48.

As for Bob's gain, I don't know how the inflation affects him, but I'll assume it's 5% less than his initial $40, which would be $38.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so my gain of $48 is now worth 20% less, which is $38.40.

Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining $100, which is $45, and taking the remaining 55%."
