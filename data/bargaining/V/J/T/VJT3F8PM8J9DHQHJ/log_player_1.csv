"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively fair offer.  I'll take $90 and give Bob $10. I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal that gives me a good chunk of the money, but is still fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more money, the value of my money is decreasing with each round.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option at this point, as rejecting it will only leave me with less money in the next round."
