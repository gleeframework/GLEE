Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 406250 
# Alice gain: 593750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but I have to be realistic.  Alice is playing hardball and knows my position weakens with every round. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee I get something, even if it's not ideal.  Continuing to hold out carries the very real risk of walking away with nothing."
