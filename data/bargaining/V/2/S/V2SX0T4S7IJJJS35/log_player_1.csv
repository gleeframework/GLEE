I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a measly $1. I figure he'll be desperate enough to take it, especially since the money is worth less for him in every round. ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  While it's not ideal, it's much better than what I offered Bob, and in the next round, the money I'd receive would be worth less while Bob's would be worth even more. It's time to take the sure win."
