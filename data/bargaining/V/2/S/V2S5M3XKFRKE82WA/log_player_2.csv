Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 55

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. Let's split it 60/40. It's the best deal we can both get with inflation eating away at our shares. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and rightfully so. The value of her share is plummeting. While this offer is better than her previous 55/45 proposal, I believe I can push for a better deal in the next round or two.  The inflation heavily favors me at this point."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"":  ""Alice, this is it. Take this offer, or risk walking away with even less.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're nearing the end. I'm willing to go up to 65/35, but I need to secure something for myself before we both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice is right - we're running out of time.  If I reject this offer, there's a good chance we'll both end up with nothing in the remaining rounds. It's a gamble to hope she'll offer me 40 or more in the next round, especially with the rapid inflation impacting her share's value."
