"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4000/6000 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether this is a good deal.

For now, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving away too much""}

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to protect my own interests. I think this 45/55 split is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept this offer."
