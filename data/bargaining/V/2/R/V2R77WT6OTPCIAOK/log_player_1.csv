"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor,  hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on. This strategy aims to minimize potential losses from inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly better for him, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll lower my offer to 80/20, hoping to find a compromise that's more favorable to both of us. While the inflation hasn't affected me yet, I believe offering a concession might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. While the inflation is hitting him hard, I'll continue to hold out for a more equitable split.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split, further reducing my share to demonstrate a willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor, even with the significant inflation impacting him. I'll continue to negotiate for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, further lowering my desired share.  This offer acknowledges Bob's significant inflation losses while still trying to secure a reasonable portion of the money for myself.  With only a few rounds left, I need to find a compromise to avoid getting nothing."
