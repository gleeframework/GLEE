"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, giving me 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the value of the money has decreased, and my gain would be $560,000 (70% of $800,000).

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.
