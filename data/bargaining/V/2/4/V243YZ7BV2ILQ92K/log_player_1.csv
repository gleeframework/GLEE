"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, but I'm not going easy on you 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 90% of the original $70, so it's equivalent to $63.

Bob's gain of $60 is worth 95% of the original $30, so it's equivalent to $28.50.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept it.
