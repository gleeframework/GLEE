I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. It's true that Bob's money is worth less now, but my offer in round 1 was very generous. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, where I will be the one proposing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, since he rejected my previous offer.  I'm hoping he'll accept before the inflation hits him too hard!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though the offer is not great, Bob's money is losing value much faster than mine.  I'd rather take the smaller share now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
