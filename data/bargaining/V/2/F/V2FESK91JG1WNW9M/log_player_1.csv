"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer is a starting point, aiming for a fair split with a slight advantage for myself, considering the inflation rate affects me more than Bob. I'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is not acceptable. While his offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it doesn't account for the inflation disadvantage I face.  I'm going to counter-propose to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a counter-proposal that acknowledges the inflation disadvantage I face, but also attempts to meet Bob halfway. My offer is closer to the 50/50 split he proposed, but still gives me a slight advantage."
