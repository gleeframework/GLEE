"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This offer splits the $10,000 equally between us, with no advantage to either player. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I get 4000 dollars, which is worth the same as in the previous round, but Bob gets 6000 dollars, which is 5% less than he would have gotten in the first round.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 4000 for me and 6000 for him, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I get 4800 dollars, which is worth the same as in the previous round, but Bob gets 5200 dollars, which is 14.26% less than he would have gotten in the first round.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise and I don't want to risk waiting for a better deal.
