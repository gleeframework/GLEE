"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful. Bob is offering a 70/30 split, which is a bit skewed towards him. I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total value is now $90 (100 * 0.9).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```

This is a 40/60 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to hold my ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, but I'm willing to give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is now worth even less, and Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards him. I need to think carefully...

I'll reject this offer as well. I'm starting to feel like Bob is not serious about finding a fair split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the total value is now $72.9 (100 * 0.713).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting worried about the value of the money, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

This is a 36/64 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but I'm trying to be reasonable and find a compromise."
