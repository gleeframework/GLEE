Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more for being the one making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject Bob's offer.  It's still very unfair, and I'm not willing to settle for so little. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm still looking for a more balanced split.  Let's try this: 5500 for me, 4500 for you. This is a better offer than the previous round, and I'm willing to negotiate further.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 50/50 split. Let's end this game with a fair outcome. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal,  it's better than the dwindling value of the money. Inflation is hitting hard, and  accepting this offer will at least secure a decent portion of the original amount."
