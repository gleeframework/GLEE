"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that inflation will decrease the value of the money in later rounds. I hope Bob will be reasonable and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's more than I would have gotten in the last round, it's still significantly less than what I proposed, and I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000} 
```

I'm offering an 81/19 split in my favor. I'm taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a significant portion of the money. I believe this is a fair offer considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, it's still a substantial sum of money, and with the inflation, I'm likely to get even less if I keep rejecting. It's time to settle for something and end this negotiation."
