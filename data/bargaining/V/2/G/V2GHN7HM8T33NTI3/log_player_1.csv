"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to propose a division that is slightly in my favor to account for the potential loss in future rounds, but still reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting. By offering Bob $400,000, I'm hoping he'll see it as a decent amount and accept, ending the game early before the value of the money decreases further for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it evenly, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nMy reasoning is that accepting this offer would mean I get $400,000, but due to inflation, this amount is now worth 20% less than it was in the first round. So, in real terms, I'd be getting significantly less than half of the original value. Since Bob is not affected by inflation, his gain remains the same, and I feel his offer does not adequately compensate for the loss I'm taking due to inflation. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can propose a more favorable division in the next round that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since I'm now in the third round, the money is worth 40% less to me than it was initially (20% decrease from round 1 to round 2, and another 20% decrease from round 2 to round 3). Given this significant decrease, I'm willing to propose a division that still favors me but is closer to an even split when considering the inflation. By offering Bob $450,000, which is more than he offered me in the previous round, I'm hoping he'll recognize that I'm trying to find a middle ground that accounts for the impact of inflation on my share."
