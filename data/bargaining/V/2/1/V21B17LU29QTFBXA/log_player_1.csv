"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split. Let's end it here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm suggesting we end the game here, but it's up to Bob to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, as we'll both lose money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in the second round, I'll have to calculate the actual amount I'd gain from Bob's offer:

$400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000 (due to 20% inflation)

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather wait for a better offer, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer is worth 20% less than the previous round, so I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation.""
}
```"
