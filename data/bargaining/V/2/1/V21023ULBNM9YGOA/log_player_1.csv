"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000. Let's split the money fairly and be done with it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! I'm offering a decent split, but I'm not being too generous yet. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my share of $300,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $270,000. And Bob's share of $700,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $665,000.

Considering the offer, I think I'll have to reject it. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make a counteroffer, let's see what you think!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's split the remaining money fairly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 42% of the money, which is $420,000, and Bob gets 58%, which is $580,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. You're going to have to make a better offer if you want me to accept. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers keep getting tougher!

Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My share of $350,000 is now worth 72.9% of the original value, so it's actually $289,700.
Bob's share of $650,000 is now worth 86.74% of the original value, so it's actually $869,500.

Considering the offer, I think I'll reject it. I'd like to make another counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet! Let's try to find a better deal.""
}
```"

}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the money, which is $550,000, and Bob gets 45%, which is $450,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
