Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair division, Alice. I'll take 50 and you can have 50. This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
