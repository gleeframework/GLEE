"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going to be greedy and try to get as much as possible in the first round.  I'll offer Bob a single dollar, hoping he'll accept it since he doesn't know about the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. Even though I'm getting a very small amount, it's still better than nothing. Plus, I know that with each round, my money will be worth less and less. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999900, ""bob_gain"": 100}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob slightly. Since he rejected my previous offer, I figure he's not afraid to wait for a better deal. I'm hoping this small increase will be enough to sway him, but I'm still trying to keep the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Even though my money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round, I'm still getting something. I'm not confident that I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round, and the inflation will only continue to work against me. It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
