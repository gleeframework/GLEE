Let's start with a fair split!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'll offer a slightly better deal for myself, hoping to tempt Bob into accepting before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gains."

I'll see if I can do better in the next round.  Inflation is making things difficult, but I'm determined to get at least half of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm pushing my luck a bit further, but I need to secure a deal quickly with the inflation eating away at our money."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Inflation is getting out of hand, and I need to secure something before we both end up with nothing.  I'll take the 38, even though it's less than I hoped for."
