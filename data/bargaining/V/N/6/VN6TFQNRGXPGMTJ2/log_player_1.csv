Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing to keep $9000 for myself and give $1000 to Bob.  It's a big offer for the first round, but I'm hoping to get this done quickly.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better than risking a lower payout in future rounds. Let's end this game!"
