"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take this, and we can be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer is too skewed in Alice's favor, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what I can propose in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more balanced, considering the inflation that affects both of us. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice with each passing round, I'll try to find a middle ground that benefits both parties.
