I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.  While it seems like a lot of money, I'm aiming for a quick resolution and hoping he'll accept.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting significantly less than I wanted, the inflation means that my share would be worth even less if I rejected and went another round."
