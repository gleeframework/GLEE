Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a very straightforward split, giving myself the majority share since I'm the first to propose. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but we'll see!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this offer is fair given the inflation and Bob's counter-proposal. It's a 50/50 split, and accepting ensures I get something rather than risking getting nothing in further rounds."
