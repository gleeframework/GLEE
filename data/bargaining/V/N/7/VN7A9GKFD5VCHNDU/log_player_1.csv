"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI am offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, which I believe is a reasonable and fair split. Let's see if Bob accepts or decides to proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer accounts for the decreasing value over time. Let's be reasonable and wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer. Although the money's value is decreasing, his proposed split doesn't seem fair to me, especially considering the higher rate of inflation affecting my share. I'll proceed to the next round and make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle.""}\n\nGiven the decreasing value of money, I've adjusted my proposal. I'm now offering $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob. This split takes into account the impact of inflation on both our shares and is a compromise between our previous offers. Hopefully, Bob will find this acceptable and we can conclude the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, the money is losing value fast - especially for you, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant decrease in the value of money, especially for me, and considering Bob's message that this is his final offer, I've decided to accept his proposal. The difference between our shares is relatively small, and further rounds would only lead to more loss due to inflation. It's time to conclude the game and secure what's left of the value."
