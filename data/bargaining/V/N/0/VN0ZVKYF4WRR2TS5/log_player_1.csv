Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is slowly increasing, but it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  The inflation is working against him, so he needs to make more significant moves to entice me to accept.  I'm willing to hold out longer to see if he gets more desperate."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly entrenched in his position and not budging much. However, the inflation is steadily chipping away at the value of his share.  He's losing more with every round he refuses. It's risky, but I'm betting he'll crack under pressure soon."
