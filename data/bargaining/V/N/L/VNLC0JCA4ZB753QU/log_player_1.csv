"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value. To me, the offer is:

# Alice gain: 4500 / 0.95 = 4737.89 (in original value)
# Bob gain: 5500 / 0.9 = 6111.11 (in original value)

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and the inflation effect is cumulative, the money is worth 95% of 95% of the original value, or 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of the original value.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}"
