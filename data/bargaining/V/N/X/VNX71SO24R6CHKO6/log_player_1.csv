"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation's impact on your end, I believe a 60/40 split is a more accurate reflection of the game's dynamics. This offer accounts for the decreasing value on your side while being fair from my perspective. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
