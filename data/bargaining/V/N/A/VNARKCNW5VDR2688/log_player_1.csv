"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20, and I'll take 80. What do you think?""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid losing value due to inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  50/50 is the best way to start. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my potential gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you 45, and I'll take 55. It's a good deal, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's aim for a 60/40 split, that seems more fair considering the inflation.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I need to be careful.

However, Bob's 60/40 split is a bit too skewed towards his favor, considering the initial offer I made was already a generous 80/20. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain, and I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you more than 40. I'll take 60, and that's my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we need to be more realistic.  I'm offering 65 for myself, and 35 for you.  Inflation is only getting worse, so let's come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly, and I'm getting desperate. However, I'm not willing to give up more than 35, considering the initial offer I made was already a generous 80/20. I'll accept this offer, hoping to salvage what's left of the deal.
