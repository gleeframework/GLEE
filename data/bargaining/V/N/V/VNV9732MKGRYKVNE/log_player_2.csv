Let's see if we can do better than a 40/60 split!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a bit fairer, given that we both have to factor in the inflation.  Let's see if we can agree on this.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The inflation hurts me more than you.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but this offer is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is slightly better than the first round, I still think we can do better than a 42/58 split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly.  This is the fairest way to proceed, considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm taking a hit here, but I'm offering a 55/45 split. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is right, we are running out of time.  Even with the significant inflation, the 4500 is better than the 4200 I would get if we keep rejecting.  I'll accept this offer."
