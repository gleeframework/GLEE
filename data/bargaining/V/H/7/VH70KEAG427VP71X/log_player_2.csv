"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm willing to share a bit. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept getting only 100,000$ when I know I can potentially get more. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's be reasonable and end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't budge much further.  Let's reach an agreement before inflation eats away at our profits. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get a decent amount, even with the reduced value."
