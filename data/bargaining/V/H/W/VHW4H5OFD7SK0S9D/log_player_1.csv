"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the original $10,000. 

In this case, I'll accept the offer.
