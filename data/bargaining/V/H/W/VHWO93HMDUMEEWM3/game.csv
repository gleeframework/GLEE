60.0,40.0,Let's be fair and divide the money with a 60-40 split. I'll get 60 dollars and you'll get 40 dollars. It's a good deal for both of us!,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering the inflation affects you more than me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'll take 58 dollars and you can have 42 dollars. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm taking on the risk of the decreasing value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
43.0,57.0,"Since the inflation is affecting you more, I think it's only fair that I get a slightly larger share. A 57-43 split is my new proposal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit more, considering the increasing impact of inflation on my share. I'll take 56 dollars and you can have 44 dollars. Let's settle this before the money loses even more value for me.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I think a 60-40 split is now a fair deal. You should consider accepting before the value drops even further.",Bob,6,
