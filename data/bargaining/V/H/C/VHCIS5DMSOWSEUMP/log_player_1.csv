"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is slightly more favorable to him, I'll try to counter with a more generous offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to offer a slightly higher percentage to Bob this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 42, ""bob_gain"": 58}

I'm offering Bob 58% of the remaining $100, which is $58, and I'll take the remaining 42%, which is $42."
