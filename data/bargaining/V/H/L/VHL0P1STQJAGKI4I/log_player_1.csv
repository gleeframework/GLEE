Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm being a little greedy here, but I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer, and I'm happy to accept it rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
