"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want more for myself! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him such a large share, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
