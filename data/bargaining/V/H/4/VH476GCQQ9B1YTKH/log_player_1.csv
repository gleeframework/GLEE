"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a clean slate, Bob. I'll take the whole $100, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This is a bold opening move, but I'm hoping Bob will see the humor in it and be willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair share, then we can negotiate from here. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to be reasonable.

I'll think for a moment... If I accept this offer, I'll get $20, which is 20% of the original $100. Not bad, but I was hoping to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Maybe Bob will make a better offer next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has already reduced the value of the money, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent chunk, Bob. But I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. A 50/50 split seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds like a reasonable compromise, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll take this offer and split the remaining $48.80 (80% of the original $100) 50/50 with Bob. It's not a bad outcome, considering the circumstances!"
