"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
``` 

This is a classic negotiation scenario. I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer (51/49) to see if Bob will accept it or try to negotiate for a better split.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly better split for myself,  Bob's offer is fair and it's better to accept than risk getting nothing in later rounds due to inflation."
