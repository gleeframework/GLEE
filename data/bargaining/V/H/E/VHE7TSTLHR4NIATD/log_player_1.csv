"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a straightforward and fair proposal. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided offer from Bob!

I'll reject his offer and proceed to Round 3. I'm not willing to accept such an unfair split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make another offer!

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than my initial 50/50 proposal, but I'm still keeping a slight edge for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

I'll reject his offer again. His offer is still not good enough, and I'm not willing to accept such a low share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another offer!

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but still trying to keep a slight edge for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my desired share, but I'm still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting closer to his desired share!

I'll accept his offer this time. It's a 55/45 split, which is still not ideal for me, but I'm willing to settle for it since it's closer to a fair share than his previous offers.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
