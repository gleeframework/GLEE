"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Despite the inflation, I think I can get a better deal than $4,500, especially considering that Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}


I'm offering to take $5,800 and give Bob $4,200, with a message suggesting that we meet in the middle. Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting desperate here 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}\n\n


Considering the significant inflation, I think this is a good time to accept Bob's offer. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'd rather take $4,200 now than risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. Plus, Bob seems desperate, but I'm not sure I can get a better offer from them!"
