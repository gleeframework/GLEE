"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a bit more equitable, considering the upcoming inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather take the 45% share now than risk waiting and possibly getting less in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
