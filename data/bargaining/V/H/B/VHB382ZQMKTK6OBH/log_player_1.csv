Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing. We both lose value, but at different rates.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
