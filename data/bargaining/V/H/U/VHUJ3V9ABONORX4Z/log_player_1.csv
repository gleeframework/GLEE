"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll start low 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is a significant reduction from the initial amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a relatively low offer, but I'm willing to take it to end the game quickly."
