"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the money, and I'll get the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $80, and Bob will get $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $45 in the first round's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair 50/50 split.
