I'm going to be greedy and try to get the majority of the money. I figure Bob will likely accept this, as it's still a decent amount for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my previous offer was for him. I'm going to reject it and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to get closer to a 50/50 split this time, even though the money is worth less to me now. I'm hoping that Bob will see that he's already gotten a pretty good deal, and that he'll accept this offer to avoid another round."
