I propose taking 900,000$ for myself and giving 100,000$ to Bob. This feels like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to lower my share slightly to 550,000, and offer Bob 450,000. Since the money is losing value, I need to be more aggressive to ensure a good outcome for myself."
