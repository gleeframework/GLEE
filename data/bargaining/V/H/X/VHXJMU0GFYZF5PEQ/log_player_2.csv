"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I have an incentive to delay accepting to get a potentially better deal as Alice becomes more desperate due to the devaluing of her potential share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is fair.""}\n\nSince the money loses value for Alice with each passing round, I'm offering her a slightly worse deal than the initial 50/50 split, hoping she'll accept before her share devalues further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a little more. I'll take 4800, and you get 5200. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I can afford to wait for a better deal. Alice's offer is better than the initial 50/50 split but not as good as the deal I offered in round 2, which she rejected. Given that her share will continue to devalue, I'll reject this offer in hopes of getting an even better deal in the next round.### {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Given the significant devaluation of your share, I believe this is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\nSince Alice's share continues to lose value and she's under increasing pressure to accept a deal before it devalues further, I'm offering her a less favorable deal than before. This strategy leverages the asymmetric impact of inflation in the game to my advantage, aiming to maximize my gain."
