  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm hoping for more later 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 300,000 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is 285,000. I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Round 3

Round 4

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains. Considering the offer, my gain of 200,000 is worth 95% * 0.951 (5% less for each round) * 0.951 (another 5% less for this round) = 87.55% of the original amount, which is approximately 873,500. I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's getting harder to hold out.
