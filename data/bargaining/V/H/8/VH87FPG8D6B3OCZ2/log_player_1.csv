"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. Since inflation affects us both, I'll try to secure most of the money right away. I'm taking a risk that Bob will accept, but I think it's worth it for the potential payoff."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best choice in this situation. With inflation, the money I'd get in future rounds would be worth much less. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing later."
