# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about compromising, she's undervaluing the impact of inflation on her end. I need to push for a larger share while it's still significantly more valuable to her than later rounds."

# Alice gain: 52
