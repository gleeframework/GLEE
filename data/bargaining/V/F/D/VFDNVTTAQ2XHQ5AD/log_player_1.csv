"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a high stake, hoping Bob will take the small amount to avoid risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, taking 5000 is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds. The inflation effect on Bob is unclear, and it's risky to assume he won't try to take a bigger share later."
