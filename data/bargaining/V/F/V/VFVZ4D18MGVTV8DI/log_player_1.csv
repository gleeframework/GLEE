"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the low offer, Alice, I'm not afraid to walk away! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me $4,000, when I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, Bob. You'll get $4,500, and I'll get $5,500. Your turn again!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal to Bob, hoping he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting any more generous, Alice? I'll take the middle ground this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take the middle ground this time.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept the offer, as it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal. I'll take $5,000 and we can finally end the game!"
