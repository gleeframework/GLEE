"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we split the money 60/40.  It's a generous offer considering the inflation we're facing. Let's wrap this up quickly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The 60/40 split isn't favorable enough for me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth. Let's settle on this.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the inflation rates for both of us and tried to find a middle ground that benefits me more than Alice's initial offer but is still reasonable for her. The message aims to create a sense of urgency and fairness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking another hit from inflation.  58/42 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, Alice's offer of 58/42, although still not ideal, becomes more acceptable. The threat of further inflation and the risk of not getting a better deal in subsequent rounds make accepting this offer the most prudent decision at this point."
