Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money, and it's disappearing for you faster than for me. This offer is still generous, take it before it shrinks further!

# Alice gain: 700000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a quarter of a million dollars, which is rapidly becoming worth less and less to you. Don't be foolish, accept this deal! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of potential earnings due to inflation.  Alice is clearly trying to leverage the time pressure against me. I need to remain firm in seeking a more equitable deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting painful. I'm lowering my demand again, but my patience is wearing thin. You're losing serious money with every refusal. Agree now, and we both walk away with something! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, but her offer is still significantly skewed in her favor.  While the inflation is hurting, I need to hold out a little longer to try and secure a better deal.  The next few rounds will be critical in determining if Alice is willing to negotiate a fairer split."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution.  Let's end this now before we both lose out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Offering a 50/50 split leaves no room for argument about fairness and highlights the very real risk that we both face if we fail to agree.  With the inflation escalating, this is the best chance to secure a reasonable amount before it's too late."
