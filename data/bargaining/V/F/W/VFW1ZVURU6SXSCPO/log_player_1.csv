"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for Bob to accept or reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger risk and propose a more uneven split. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* Alice gain: 2000 / 0.8 = 2500 (due to 20% less value)
* Bob gain: 8000 / 0.95 = 8421.05 (due to 5% less value)

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the effective amount is:

* Alice gain: 2500 / 0.8 = 3125

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to give you a small chance to take the lead. Don't expect more than this. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3000 / (1 - 0.488) = 3000 / 0.512 = 5857.89 (due to 48.8% less value)
* Bob gain: 7000 / (1 - 0.1426) = 7000 / 0.8574 = 8148.45 (due to 14.26% less value)

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
