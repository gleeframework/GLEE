"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $90 and Bob receiving $10. This is a fair starting point as it gives Bob a small amount while still leaving the majority for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take effect and I'm losing a significant portion of my potential earnings. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than my initial proposal."
