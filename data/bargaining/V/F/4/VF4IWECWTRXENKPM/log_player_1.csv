"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still leave you with a decent amount. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to balance the fairness of the offer with the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round! 

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this. I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a fair share too. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a bigger share and getting a decent amount for myself, considering the money is worth less and less with each round."
