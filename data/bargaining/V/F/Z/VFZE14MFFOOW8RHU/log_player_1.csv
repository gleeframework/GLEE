"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me (Alice) getting $9,000 and Bob getting $1,000.  It's a fair starting point and allows us both to get a substantial share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900} 
```

I'm offering a split of 81/19, with me getting $8,100 and Bob getting $1,900.  This is a compromise to account for the inflation and gives us both a significant share of the money while still showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710} 
```

I'm offering a split of 72.9/27.1, with me getting $7,290 and Bob getting $2,710.  This is another compromise to account for the increasing inflation, and it ensures we both get a decent share of the money before it's too late."
