"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you were very generous in the last round. However, I believe I can do better this time.  Let's split the money almost evenly, with a slight advantage for me, given the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
