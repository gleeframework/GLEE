"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent share, let's split it 90-10""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in the first round, I'll take a more modest share this time 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth significantly less than the $900,000 I would have gotten in the first round. I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, where my gain will be worth even less due to inflation."

  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bigger share this time, but don't expect more""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my offer to account for the increasing inflation, while also keeping some leverage for future rounds."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth a lot less than the $900,000 I would have gotten in the first round. I'm starting to feel the pinch.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a more serious offer in the next round, but I'm also preparing myself for the possibility that I might have to accept a lower offer due to the increasing inflation."

  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'll give you most of the money, but don't expect a smile""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth a tiny fraction of the $900,000 I would have gotten in the first round. I'm getting worried that I might be left with almost nothing.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm trying to hold out for a better deal, but I'm starting to feel like I'm in a tough spot. I'm not sure how much longer I can withstand the pressure of inflation."

{
  ""alice_gain"": 150000,
  ""bob_gain"": 850000,
  ""message"": ""I'm almost out of options, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm getting desperate, and my gain of $150,000 is now worth a tiny fraction of the original $900,000. I'm hoping Bob will take pity on me and accept this offer, but I'm not counting on it."
