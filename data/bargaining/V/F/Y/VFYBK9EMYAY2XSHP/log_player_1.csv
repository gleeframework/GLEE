{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I was hoping for a more substantial gain, and this offer is still a bit too skewed towards Bob. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if we can find a better compromise."

I'm not willing to accept this offer. The offer is still heavily skewed towards Bob, and I'm not comfortable with the idea of getting only 45% of the total amount. I'd like to propose a new offer and try to find a better compromise."
