"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with a single dollar. This is a very aggressive opening move, designed to see if Bob is willing to play hardball or if he'll accept a small amount to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair and ensures I get a substantial amount.  It's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
