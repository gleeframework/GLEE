Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split seems like the most fair way to divide the money.  We can't keep going back and forth - we're losing value with each round! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
