  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000 and keep 6000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a split of 6000 for me and 4000 for you. This takes into account the decreasing value of money in each subsequent round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I think Bob's proposal is a good one. I'll accept his offer.
