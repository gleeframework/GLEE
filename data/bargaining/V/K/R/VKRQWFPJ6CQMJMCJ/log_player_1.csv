"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a greedy approach for the first round. I want to maximize my share, knowing that the money will lose value with each passing round.  I'm offering Bob a tiny amount just to keep the game going and give me a chance to make more proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While this is a significant drop from my initial proposal, it's better than getting nothing due to the 10% inflation.  Accepting this offer means I'm guaranteed to get something, even with the inflation."
