{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to drive the price down! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the drastic 80-20 split. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still a reasonable compromise."
