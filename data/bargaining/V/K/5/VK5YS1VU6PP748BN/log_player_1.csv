"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good balance""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it allows us to split the money relatively evenly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different balance, I think this is fairer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not too happy about Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and now he's trying to take a bigger chunk of the pie. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I think we can find a compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and give him a fair share of the money."
