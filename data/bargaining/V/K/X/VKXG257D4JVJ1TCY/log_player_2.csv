Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 57

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily decreasing her demand, but it's still early in the game.  The inflation is working in my favor. If I hold out a bit longer, I can likely secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is it, Alice. A fair 50/50 split. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a 50/50 split now. It's a strong negotiating position: 

* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is inherently appealing because it's objectively fair. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point. The pressure is on Alice to accept something before the shrinking pot makes it even less worthwhile for her.
* **Future Leverage:** If she rejects this offer, I can start to decrease my offer in smaller increments, knowing that the longer the game goes, the worse it gets for her."
