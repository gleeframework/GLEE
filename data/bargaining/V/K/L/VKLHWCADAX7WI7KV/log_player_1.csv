"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80, you get 20. My turn to dictate the ratio! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a bold move by Bob!

I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up 80% of the remaining money, especially with the value decreasing due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counteroffer!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 50-50""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this more balanced offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair share for you! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to squeeze a bit more out of me!

Considering the inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 45 is a reasonable share, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll take this offer to end the game."
