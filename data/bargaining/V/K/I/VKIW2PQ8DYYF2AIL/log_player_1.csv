"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, I'll take the risk of inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a relatively aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Inflation is a risk for both of us, and it's best to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain would be worth 70% of the original value, so I'd only get $49.

Considering the offer is now 50-50, I'd rather take it. Inflation is indeed a risk for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing more value.
