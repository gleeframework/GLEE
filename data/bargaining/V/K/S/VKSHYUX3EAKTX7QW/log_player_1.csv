"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money into two parts, with you receiving $250,000. I believe this is fair given the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share now, but I think 800,000 is a fair amount considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
