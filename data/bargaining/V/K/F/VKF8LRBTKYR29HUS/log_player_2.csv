Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Your split wasn't considering the inflation. I'm proposing 70/30 -  think about it, it'll be worth much less next round for you.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point about inflation.  I'm willing to compromise - let's go with a 40/60 split.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and we don't have to worry about the value dropping further. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
