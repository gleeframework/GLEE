Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive offer, but I want to see how Bob reacts to it. Since I'm taking 99.9% of the money, I expect Bob to be very unhappy with this proposal and likely reject it. This will allow me to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is much better than the first one, I'm still not happy with it. I'm losing a significant portion of the money, and I know that Bob will only offer less in the next round. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, and it's a bit more fair than Bob's last offer.  I hope he sees this as a reasonable offer and accepts it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is getting worse and worse for me, but it's important to consider the inflation. In the first round, I was aiming for 99.9% of the money. Now, after three rounds of inflation, my share is worth less than half of what it was initially. If I reject this offer, I risk getting an even smaller share in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
