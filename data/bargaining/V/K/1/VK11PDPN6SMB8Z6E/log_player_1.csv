Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to cooperate or if he's aiming for a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While the inflation reduces the value of my gains, it's still not worth accepting such a disproportionate split. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, hoping to avoid another rejection. While I'm still losing value due to inflation, I'm trying to strike a compromise to end the game."
