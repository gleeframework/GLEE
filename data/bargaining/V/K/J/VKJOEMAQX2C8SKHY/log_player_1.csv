"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $100 equally, with each of us getting $50. This is a simple and straightforward offer, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I deserve a better share, considering the original $100 was supposed to be split fairly. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get a more equal split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer, but still a compromise. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer and we can finalize the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm surprised by Bob's sudden willingness to give me a bigger share! Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm willing to accept this offer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of 60/40, thinking that it's a good compromise considering the circumstances. Let's finalize the division and end the game!"
