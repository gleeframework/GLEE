"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on the ratio. You'll have to do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of its value relative to the initial $100.

In this case, I'll calculate my gain as 20 * 0.9 = 18, and Bob's gain as 80 * 0.9 = 72.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, as I'd like to try to negotiate a better ratio."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 81% of its original value now (90% of 90%), I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50. No need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still holding firm on the 4:1 ratio. You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1%).

In this case, I'll calculate my gain as 15 * 0.729 = 10.935, and Bob's gain as 85 * 0.729 = 61.845.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, as I'd like to try to negotiate a better ratio. The 4:1 ratio is still too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'd like to try to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 72.9% of its original value now (72.9% of 90% of 90% of 100%), I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on the ratio. Let's try 60-40.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on the ratio. You'll have to give me more than 40%! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round (100% - 40.95%).

In this case, I'll calculate my gain as 10 * 0.5905 = 5.905, and Bob's gain as 90 * 0.5905 = 53.245.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, as the ratio is still heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better split, but I'm starting to get concerned that I might be left with very little if we continue to play."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 59.05% of its original value now (59.05% of 72.9% of 90% of 90% of 100%), I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need to get something. 30-70 is the best I can do.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
