Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but it leaves Bob with a small amount. I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds, especially as the value of the money will decrease for me with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is less than what I initially proposed, it's still a significant gain. Given the inflation factor, I'm better off accepting this offer rather than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds. It's also important to consider that the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, which might make him more inclined to accept a lower offer."
