"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively equal division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want to try to get a bit more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'll have to think carefully about the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, taking into account the inflation, I'd be getting $50, which is worth $47.50 in real terms. I think I can do better than that. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my money is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be even more careful with my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'm not giving up much""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a slight improvement for me, but still a relatively fair division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still want a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully about the value of the money I'd be getting.

Since my money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, $45 is equivalent to $39.13 in real terms. That's a bit too low for me, considering the risks of further inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, hoping that Bob will come back with an even better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my money is worth 19.64% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be even more aggressive with my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm still willing to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering a 58-42 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer before the inflation gets even worse!"
