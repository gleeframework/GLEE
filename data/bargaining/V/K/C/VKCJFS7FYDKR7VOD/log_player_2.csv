"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While getting something is better than nothing, I'm willing to bet Alice's need for the money will make her offer a larger sum as the rounds progress and inflation eats into her potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's not waste time with unrealistic demands.  This is a strong offer considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still skewed in her favor.  The significant inflation working against her means she'll likely offer a larger share to Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and that money is shrinking fast - especially for you. I'm offering a deal that lets us both walk away with something substantial. Don't let greed get the best of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't give up too much. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one, as it's getting close to a ""fair"" split, but time is working against Alice more than me. While her offer is still slightly in her favor in raw numbers, considering the rapid inflation she's facing, rejecting this might push her to offer a larger chunk in the next round where she loses even more value."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 725000,
""alice_gain"": 275000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or we both lose BIG.  I'm offering you more than you'd get by taking this to the next round, even if I accepted an even split!""
