Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give a little more, Bob. But let's be fair - I'm still getting the short end of the stick here.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I need to be compensated for the inflation, take this offer before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm not sure what your game is, but I'm not going to give you more than 40%.  Let's find a compromise before we both lose out completely. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's getting too risky to reject.  The longer the game goes on, the less favorable the outcome will be due to inflation. Taking $40 now is better than risking getting $0 later.
