"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better deal. The current offer doesn't seem entirely fair to me. I'm hoping we can find a more balanced division. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more balance, considering the inflation on my end.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that takes into account the inflation factor affecting my portion. Hopefully, Alice will see the fairness in this division and accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a little more than 45 to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current inflation rate affecting my portion, I believe accepting 45 would be equivalent to an even lower value than initially proposed. I'm hoping to find a more equitable solution in the next round, despite the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation on my end, I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nI've considered the impact of inflation on my portion and have adjusted my offer accordingly. I'm hoping Alice will see the compromise and accept this division."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a little more than 48 to make this work for me.  Let's find a solution that's fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my portion, with its value decreasing by 18.55% since the first round, I believe accepting 47 at this point is the most reasonable decision. Continuing negotiations into further rounds would only decrease the value of my potential gain, making this offer the best option under the current circumstances."
