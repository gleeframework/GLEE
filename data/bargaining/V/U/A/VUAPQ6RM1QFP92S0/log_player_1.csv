This is a good time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Matching our initial proposal:** Bob is now offering the same split we initially proposed. 
* **Inflation working in our favor:** While our $60 is worth the same as it was in round 1, Bob's $40 is worth considerably less than it was initially. 
* **Time pressure:**  We're over halfway through the rounds.  Continuing to push for a slightly better deal risks Bob becoming more desperate and offering even less favorable splits later."
