"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount to start.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and make it a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $5000 in the second round is actually worth $4000 (80% of $5000). 

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
