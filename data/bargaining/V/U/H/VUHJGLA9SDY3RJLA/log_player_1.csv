"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation we're dealing with. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give in to Bob's demand for a 60-40 split. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to adjust the split to my advantage. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is still relatively close to Bob's original offer, but with a slightly better outcome for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to the previous offer, still a fair compromise""}"
