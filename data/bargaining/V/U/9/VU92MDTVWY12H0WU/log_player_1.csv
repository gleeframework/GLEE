"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's not waste more rounds! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is tempting because it's more than I'd get if I rejected and proposed the same split next round. However, Bob is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me. I'll take a risk.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but the split needs to reflect the faster inflation I'm facing. This is my final offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm also losing value with each round. This is a fair compromise, considering we both have less to gain now. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is slowly inching towards a more equitable split, but it's still in his favor. I need to consider that if I reject this, the next offer from him might be even worse due to the increasing inflation working against me.
