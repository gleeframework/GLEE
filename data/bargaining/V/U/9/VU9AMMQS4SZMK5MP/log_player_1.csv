Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to trick me into accepting his offer by mirroring my previous proposal!

I'll reject his offer from Round 2.
