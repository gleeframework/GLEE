"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'd like to get a better deal. But Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which is a decent compromise.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I need to be strategic.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is trying to take advantage of that!

Wait a minute... Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, but now the money is worth less for me. I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth 19.39% less than in the first round now, so I need to be even more careful.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $475,000 and keeping $525,000 for myself."
