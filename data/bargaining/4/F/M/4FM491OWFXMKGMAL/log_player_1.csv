"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""A fair share for both""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. Given the rules of the game and the impact of inflation, starting with a higher initial offer allows room for negotiation while also considering the devaluation of money over rounds. The message ""A fair share for both"" aims to set a tone of fairness and cooperation, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This factors in the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the significant difference in how inflation affects us, accepting this offer would put me at a considerable disadvantage. With the money being worth 20% less for me in just the second round, and the offer being $400,000, the actual value I would receive is substantially lower than what Bob would get, considering his money is only worth 5% less. It's too early to accept such a skewed division, especially with 10 rounds left to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation and the need to find a mutually acceptable solution before the money devalues further, I've adjusted my offer. By proposing $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for Bob, I'm aiming to find a middle ground that acknowledges the unequal effects of inflation on our gains while still being more generous than my initial offer. The message aims to convey a willingness to compromise and find a fair solution that considers both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The rate is getting us nowhere Alice. Meet me in the middle and let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's message appeals to meeting in the middle and ending the negotiations, the current offer doesn't adequately compensate for the significantly higher rate of inflation affecting my share. With my money now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and Bob's only 14.26% less, accepting $450,000 would result in a far lower actual value compared to Bob's $550,000. Given the substantial disparity in how inflation impacts us, and with 8 rounds left, I believe there's still room to negotiate a more equitable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Let's adjust for inflation impact and find a real middle ground.""}\n\nConsidering the increasing impact of inflation and the rejection of previous offers, I've recalculated to propose a division that more accurately reflects a compromise. By offering $520,000 for myself and $480,000 for Bob, I'm attempting to adjust for the disparate effects of inflation on our shares. The message emphasizes the need to find a true middle ground that accounts for the different rates at which our money is devaluing, aiming to bring the negotiations closer to a mutually acceptable conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal considering the depreciation, Alice. Let's close it out. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite Bob's insistence that this is a fair deal, the reality is that with my money now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, and Bob's worth only 22.62% less, the offer of $480,000 for me and $520,000 for Bob does not equitably address the significant difference in how inflation affects us. Given the substantial loss in value I'm facing, and with 6 rounds still available, I believe there's a need to continue negotiating to find a division that more accurately reflects the impact of inflation on both our shares."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Equal split to account for disparate inflation effects.""}\n\nAt this point, with inflation significantly impacting my share more than Bob's, proposing an equal split of $500,000 each is an attempt to find a straightforward and fair resolution. This offer acknowledges the different rates of depreciation but seeks to simplify the negotiation by splitting the remaining value equally, despite the previous rejections and the ongoing impact of inflation. The message aims to convey a sense of fairness and a willingness to conclude the negotiations on equal terms, despite the unequal effects of inflation."
