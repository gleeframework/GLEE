Let's see what Alice offers next! I can do better than 400,000."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Alice 400,000 and keep 600,000 for myself. I believe this is a fair split, and I'm confident she'll accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can get a better deal with the inflation. I'll take the 500,000."
