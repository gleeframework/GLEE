Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and every round costs you more.  I'll offer 70/30, which is more than generous considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000
