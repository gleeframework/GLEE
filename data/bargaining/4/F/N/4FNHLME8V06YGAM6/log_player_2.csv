"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 1000$ is something, it's a very small share. It's worth trying to negotiate for more, especially considering inflation will be a factor in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5000,

""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  We both get a good share, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our gains in the future rounds.""
