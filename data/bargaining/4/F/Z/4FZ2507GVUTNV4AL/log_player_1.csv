Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, especially since the money is worth the same to me but 20% less to Bob. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite his message suggesting it's his final offer, I believe the impact of inflation on his gain is significant enough that I can push for a better deal. The fact that the money is worth 48.8% less to him than in the first round puts me in a stronger negotiating position. I'll make another offer that benefits me more, considering the current state of inflation affecting Bob's gains.###\n\n###"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your gains, I believe this is a reasonable adjustment""}\n\n###\nConsidering the money is now worth 48.8% less to Bob than in the first round, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect this significant loss in value for him. By offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself, I'm leveraging the pressure of inflation on his side to maximize my gain. This might be a more aggressive offer, but the circumstances of the game favor me at this point. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or if the game continues!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the absolute lowest I can go.  We both lose if we continue. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite his message indicating it's the lowest he can go, the impact of inflation on his gains continues to weaken his position. With the money being worth 67.23% less to him than in the first round, I believe I can continue to push for an even better deal. The pressure of inflation on Bob's side gives me the upper hand in negotiations, and I'm willing to continue the game to maximize my gain, even if Bob believes we both lose if we continue. The current state of inflation affecting Bob's gains significantly tips the scales in my favor, and I'll aim to capitalize on this advantage in the next round.###\n\n###"

My message emphasizes that, given the circumstances, this is the most reasonable offer I'm willing to make.
