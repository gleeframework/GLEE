"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm willing to give you a good chunk of money to make a deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total amount, and keeping $800,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'm hoping for a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to weigh the offer carefully. However, Bob's offer is quite generous, and I don't want to risk losing more money in subsequent rounds.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
