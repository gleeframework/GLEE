Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 520000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is inching closer, it's still crucial to hold strong. The inflation disproportionately affects her.  Delaying further works in my favor, increasing the pressure on her to accept a deal more beneficial to me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the most logical solution. We're both losing out with each passing round.""}

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to shift strategy.  Alice is clearly aiming for a slight advantage but is willing to compromise. Offering a 50/50 split now presents a compelling case:

* **Fairness:** It removes the debate over who deserves more, simplifying the decision.
* **Urgency:**  The inflation impact is significant now. Delaying further risks a worse outcome for both. 

While I could push for a slightly higher gain, the risk of Alice rejecting and the diminishing returns due to inflation make this the most strategically sound offer."
