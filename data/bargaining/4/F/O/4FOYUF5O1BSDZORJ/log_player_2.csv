"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal for both of us considering the decreasing value! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it closer to even, considering the value is going down for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the value is decreasing, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, it seems unlikely Alice will budge further.  Let's take what we can get!"
