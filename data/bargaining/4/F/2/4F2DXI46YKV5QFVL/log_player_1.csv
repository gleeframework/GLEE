"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob $30, and I'll take the remaining $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider the adjusted amounts.

In this case, I'll accept the offer. I'll get $60 and Bob will get $40.
