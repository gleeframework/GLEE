"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the 10% decrease in value, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,500 in the first round's money. Still a decent amount, but not as appealing as it initially seems.

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I need more for the risk!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, hoping Bob will see the value in taking a slightly smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the new offer, I'll calculate the value of my potential gain. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of $5,200 is actually worth $3,745 in the first round's money. Not a great deal for me, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
