"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar. This is a very aggressive strategy, but it aims to secure the maximum possible gain in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept, but I'm prepared for him to reject and make his own proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
