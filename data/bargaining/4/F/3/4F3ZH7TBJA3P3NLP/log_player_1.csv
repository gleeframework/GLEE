"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Here's a fair split, let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, Bob thinks he's being fair, but I'm not convinced!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair and balanced division considering the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

But I notice that Bob's offer is actually worse for him than my previous offer, considering the inflation rate. I'll take advantage of that!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope Bob will make a better one in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Time to split it down the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree!"
