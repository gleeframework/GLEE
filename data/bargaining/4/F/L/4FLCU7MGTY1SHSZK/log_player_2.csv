Let's see what Alice offers next! I want a bigger share."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Alice takes my offer, or if she wants to try and get a bigger piece of the pie."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting less than I hoped for, the inflation is going to significantly reduce the value of any future offers, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
