"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the initial $10,000. This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  We both get the same amount, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob in the second round, his offer of $5,000 is actually equivalent to $5,500 in the first round. I'm not sure if this is a fair offer, considering I'm still getting $6,000, which is worth the same as in the first round.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob in the third round, and 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! Take this offer or risk getting even less!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money closer to even, but I need to get a better share than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less for Bob in the fourth round, his offer of $4,500 is actually equivalent to $6,200 in the first round. Considering my previous offer was $7,000, I'm not sure if this is a significant enough increase for Bob to warrant accepting.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less for Bob in the fifth round, and 40.1% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the increasing inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! This is my final offer - take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than your last offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 40.95% less for Bob in the sixth round, his offer of $4,000 is actually equivalent to $6,700 in the first round. Considering my previous offer was $7,500, I'm not sure if this is a significant enough increase for Bob to warrant accepting.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is closer to even than before, and I'm getting a smaller share than in my previous offer. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation.
