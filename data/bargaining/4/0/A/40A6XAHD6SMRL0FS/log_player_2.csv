""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation factor, I propose a more balanced distribution. I'll take 800,000, leaving 200,000 for you. This way, we both get a substantial amount while accounting for potential future value loss.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let that happen.  This offer is a significant compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it more appealing than our current situation.  Let's end this.

# Alice gain: 600000
