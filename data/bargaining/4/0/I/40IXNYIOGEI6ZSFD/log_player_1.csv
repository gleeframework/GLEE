"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, I'll make the first move.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with $2,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, let's compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the offer is:

* Alice gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
* Bob gain: 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going into more rounds with decreasing returns.
