"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is worth 5% less than the $6,000 I could have gotten in the first round. And Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 20% less than the $4,000 I could have gotten in the first round.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the value of the money has decreased. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2. So, my gain of $5,000 is worth 5% less than the $5,000 I could have gotten in round 2. Let me calculate that...

$5,000 x 0.95 = $4,750

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,000 and leave $6,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I want more cash now! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 4, the money is worth less due to inflation. Let me calculate the value of my gain and Bob's gain in the first round, and then adjust accordingly.

The value of $6,000 in the first round is worth 5% less in the second round, which is $5,700. In the third round, it's worth 5% less than that, which is $5,415. In the fourth round, it's worth 14.26% less than that, which is $4,667.53.

The value of $4,000 in the first round is worth 5% less in the second round, which is $3,800. In the third round, it's worth 5% less than that, which is $3,610. In the fourth round, it's worth 14.26% less than that, which is $3,108.11.

Considering the values, my gain of $3,000 in round 4 is worth $3,108.11, which is a good deal for me. I'll accept this offer.
