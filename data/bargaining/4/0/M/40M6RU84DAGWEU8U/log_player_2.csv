Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is too extreme 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that 70/30 was extreme, her counter-offer doesn't reflect the urgency of the situation and the rapidly decreasing value of the money for her. It's better to hold out for a better deal, pushing closer to a 70/30 split, as each round makes the money less appealing to Alice."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 680000,
""alice_gain"": 320000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is a negotiation, but time is literally money here.  68/32 is my final offer - let's end this and both walk away with something substantial.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Alice by presenting this as my final offer. The 68/32 split is a small concession from my previous 70/30, but still heavily in my favor, reflecting the urgency created by the inflation. By now, Alice should be feeling the pressure of the decreasing value and hopefully recognize this as her best chance to secure a sizable portion of the money."
