"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message suggesting a 60-40 split. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, let's try to meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, my gain of $2000 is worth 95% of what it was in the previous round, and Bob's gain of $8000 is worth 90% of what it was in the previous round.

I'll think for a moment... 

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.
