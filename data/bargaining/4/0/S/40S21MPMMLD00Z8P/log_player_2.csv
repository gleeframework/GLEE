Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose money with each round, so this is the most beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split in Round 3 is the safest option given the circumstances:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount, while further delays risk significant losses for both players.
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice is likely aware of the inflation and might not offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. Her willingness to split evenly suggests she wants to avoid a stalemate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer carries a high risk of ending up with nothing if an agreement isn't reached within the 12 rounds.

In this scenario, accepting the current offer minimizes potential losses and guarantees a reasonable payout."
