"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward division. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you the majority. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting, and the money is worth less and less!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'm looking for a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a better deal, can you offer more?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less again, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and keeping some value for myself."
