"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm losing money with each round.""
}
```

This offer attempts to be reasonable while still giving Alice an advantage. Here's why:

* **Fairness:** A 60/40 split isn't drastically uneven, so it might appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Time Pressure:** Highlighting the inflation factor puts a subtle pressure on Bob to accept. Delaying means less money for Alice, making Bob's potential future gains less appealing. 
* **Future Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, it sets a benchmark for future rounds. Alice can then argue for slightly less than $60 in subsequent offers, claiming she's being flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit imbalanced, Alice. Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing a slightly better split for me. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While Bob's offer is framed as a ""middle ground,"" it's actually a pretty significant shift in his favor. A $5 difference might not seem huge, but remember the inflation.  It's important to show Bob that I'm not easily swayed and that I understand the value of time in this game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""It seems like we both want a deal.  This offer is closer to my original split, but acknowledges the time pressure we're both under. Let's close this out.""
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Concession, but not capitulation:**  A drop from $60 to $58 shows I'm willing to negotiate, but the decrease is small, emphasizing the value of time.
* **Framing:**  Highlighting that this offer is closer to my original proposal subtly anchors the negotiation around my initial terms.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning the ""time pressure"" again reinforces the cost of delay for both players, encouraging Bob to accept."
