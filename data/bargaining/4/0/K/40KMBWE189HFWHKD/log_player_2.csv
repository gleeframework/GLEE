"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a decent cut. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal to compensate for the loss in value.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal. I'll suggest a division that benefits me more than Alice's initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I believe this is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I've taken into account the 10% decrease in value for me and the 5% decrease for Alice, and I'm hoping this proposal will be more acceptable to her."
