"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair start to the game, and I'm hoping he'll take it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's split it down the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take a more modest approach this time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think splitting it down the middle is a reasonable compromise, and it's a good opportunity to end the game early."
