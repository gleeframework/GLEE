"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you $100,000. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a jab, but I'm trying to make it clear that I'm being generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly, given the decreasing value of money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of money, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable one. I'll accept his proposal.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
