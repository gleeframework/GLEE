Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40, I'll take the larger share this time, but still leaving you with a decent amount.  The inflation is starting to affect me too, and I need to be a bit more cautious. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
