"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55% is a more reasonable share for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is pushing for a bigger share, eh?

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain are:

* In Round 1: $600,000
* In Round 2: $600,000 (no change due to inflation)
* In Bob's offer: $450,000 (which is 5% less than my original offer, but I still get a fixed amount)

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer. I'd rather not give up more than 10% of my original share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counteroffer!

Considering the inflation, I'll stick with my original gain of $600,000, but I'll try to get a better share for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a better share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think we can do better. I'm offering a 50-50 split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a 50-50 split, but considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain are:

* In Round 1: $600,000
* In Round 2: $600,000 (no change due to inflation)
* In Round 3: $600,000 (no change due to inflation)
* In Round 4: $600,000 (no change due to inflation, but Bob's gain is 14.26% less than in Round 1)

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, especially considering Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation. I'd rather stick with my original offer from Round 3, which would give me a better share. However, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get back to my original offer, but with a slight adjustment to account for the fact that Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a better share. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. I'm willing to give you a 47.5% share. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get closer to my offer, but still wants a slightly larger share. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain are:

* In Round 1: $600,000
* In Round 2: $600,000 (no change due to inflation)
* In Round 3: $600,000 (no change due to inflation)
* In Round 4: $600,000 (no change due to inflation)
* In Round 5: $630,000 (no change due to inflation)
* In Round 6: $600,000 (no change due to inflation, but Bob's gain is 22.62% less than in Round 1)

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with a 47.5-52.5 split, especially considering Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'd rather stick with my original offer from Round 3, which would give me a better share. However, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get back to my original offer from Round 3, but with a slight adjustment to account for the fact that Bob's gain is worth even less due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a better share. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.""
