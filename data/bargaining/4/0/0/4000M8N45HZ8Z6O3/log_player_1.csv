After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best solution. I was hoping for a more substantial gain, considering the initial 60/40 split I proposed. I'll wait for Bob's next offer to see if we can get closer to my desired outcome."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

While 40/60 is closer to my desired outcome, I'm not satisfied with the 25 dollars I'd get. I was hoping for a more substantial gain, especially considering the reduced value of money due to inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer to see if we can get closer to my target."
