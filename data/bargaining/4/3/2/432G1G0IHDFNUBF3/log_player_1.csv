"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original $1,000,000, which is a decent chunk of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is more favorable to me than my original offer, I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
