Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a strong offer, keeping most of the money for myself, but leaving enough for Bob to consider accepting.  I'm banking on him wanting to get something rather than nothing.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is ridiculous!  He's basically trying to reverse our roles completely. I'm not going to let him get away with that.  I'm going to keep fighting for a fair share.  Let's see what he does next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to reduce my share a bit, but still keep the majority.  It's clear Bob is being aggressive, but I'm hoping he'll see that continuing to push will risk us getting nothing.  Let's see if he'll compromise."
