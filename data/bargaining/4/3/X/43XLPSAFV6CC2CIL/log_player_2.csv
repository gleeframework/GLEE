"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous split. I'll take 90$, and you can have 10$. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and we can see how the inflation affects things later. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept 10$ out of 100$.  Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe a 70/30 split is reasonable given the current inflation rate. Let's find a middle ground before the next round! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, a 30/70 split is better than nothing.  The inflation is likely to only get worse, so I'll take it."
