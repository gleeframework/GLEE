"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split and see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of $300,000 is equivalent to $285,000 in the first round's value.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the first round and another 5% less than the second round), I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000. My message to Bob is to meet him in the middle and see if he's willing to accept a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the first round's money: $450,000 is worth approximately $384,900 in the first round's value.

I'll think carefully about this offer. It's a slight improvement from my previous proposal, but I'm still not getting the best deal.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 19.26% less than in the first round now.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 49-51 split, with me getting $490,000 and Bob getting $510,000. My message to Bob is to see if he's willing to give up a bit more to get the game over."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the first round's money: $480,000 is worth approximately $395,200 in the first round's value.

This offer is still not ideal, but I'm getting closer to the original $600,000 I proposed in the first round. I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a slight improvement from my previous proposal and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.
