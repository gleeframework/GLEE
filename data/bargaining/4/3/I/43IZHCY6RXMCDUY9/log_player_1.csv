"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous 10% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's end it here! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Meeting in the middle is a reasonable proposal, but it's still a 50/50 split. I'm not sure if I want to give up that much control over the division.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""You can have a smaller share, but I'm still the one making the first offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $280,000, which is 28% of the original amount, but taking into account the inflation, it's actually 31.11% of the current value. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, but I'll give you a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it.

The offer is a 40% share for me, which is a significant increase from my previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's the best deal. I'm also worried that if I reject this offer, the next round might not be as favorable.

However, I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is the best I can get, so I'll reject it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately 0.729 * 900000 = 655,100.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $460,000, which is a 46% share of the current value. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'll give you a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately 0.5905 * 900000 = 533,455.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about the 30% share, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. If I reject this offer, I might end up with even less in the next round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
