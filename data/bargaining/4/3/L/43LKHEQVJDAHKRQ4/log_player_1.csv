Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. This is a fair offer considering the inflation working against you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go.  With the inflation, we both need to be a little more flexible. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me. Bob is losing value with each round that passes.  I'm willing to be somewhat flexible, but I can still push for a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is a very fair offer considering the inflation.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need you to meet me halfway.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand time is running out, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it as close to 50/50 as we can. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a tricky one. Bob is offering more than half, but the inflation is eating into his share significantly. However, I need to consider that if I reject this, he might become more aggressive in later rounds, especially as we approach the 12-round limit. I'll hold out for a slightly better deal for now, but I need to be mindful of the time constraint."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5050,
""bob_gain"": 4950,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable split considering the circumstances.  Let's end this now and both come out ahead.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** I need to apply pressure now.  Offering a near 50/50 split but with a slight advantage to me is the best move. The ""final offer"" tactic might push Bob to accept, especially as the decreasing value significantly impacts his potential gains in later rounds."
