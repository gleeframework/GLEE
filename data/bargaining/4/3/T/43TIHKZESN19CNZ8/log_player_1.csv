"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. This is a relatively fair split, considering we don't know each other's preferences yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have all the fun, I want a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being greedy!

Considering the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. With the current offer, I'd be getting $2,500, which is equivalent to 25% of the original $10,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
