400000.0,600000.0,"I think it's fair to split the money 60-40, with me getting the larger share since I'm the one making the proposal this round.  Let's get this done before the money loses value! ",Bob,2,

200000.0,800000.0,This is my final offer.  We're losing a lot of value on our money with each passing round.  It's better to take a smaller share now than to risk getting nothing at all.,Bob,6,
