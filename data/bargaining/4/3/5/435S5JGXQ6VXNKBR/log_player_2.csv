"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice 60, which is too high. I'm hoping to get a larger share in the next rounds.\n\n###\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation rate.\n\n###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split. The money is worth less with each round, so let's make a deal!""}\n\n###\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. We both lose money with each round, so let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept the offer. Considering the inflation rate, getting 50 now is a better deal than risking further devaluation in the next rounds. The current offer is fair, given the circumstances.\n\n###\nLet's settle this and divide the money."
