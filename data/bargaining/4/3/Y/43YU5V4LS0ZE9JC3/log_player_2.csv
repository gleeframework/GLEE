"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** It's crucial to act fast. Delaying benefits Alice while hurting me due to the 20% inflation per round. 
* **Fairness:** While Alice's initial offer heavily favored her, I'm proposing a division that's slightly more beneficial to me but still reasonable for her. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but won't be taken advantage of.
* **Urgency:**  The message aims to add a little pressure on Alice to accept a decent deal now rather than risk getting a less favorable offer later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob, 58-42 is more than fair considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to hold firm and demonstrate I won't be pressured into a bad deal. Accepting a smaller percentage now will only result in a worse outcome than if I had accepted her first offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution.  The clock is ticking for both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Stand:** With inflation eating away at my potential gains, I need to make a strong final offer. 
* **Fairness as Leverage:**  Proposing a 50/50 split is undeniably fair, putting the pressure on Alice. She knows I'm losing value with each round, so refusing this offer would make her appear greedy and unreasonable.
* **Time Pressure:** Reminding her that ""the clock is ticking"" reinforces the urgency.  If she doesn't accept now, she risks me accepting a less favorable offer in a later round due to the inflation penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said the clock is ticking, but it's ticking much louder for you. Inflation is eating away your share! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right. The inflation has eaten away so much of my potential gain that her offer is now barely better than what a 50/50 split would have given me in Round 1.  

Holding out further is too risky. If I reject this, she's likely to offer even less next round, and the inflation will continue to erode whatever I might gain."
