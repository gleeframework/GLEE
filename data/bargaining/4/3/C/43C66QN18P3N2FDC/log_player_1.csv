"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

The initial offer was $10,000, and after 1 round of inflation, it's worth 80% of the original value, or $8,000. Now, Bob's offer is $6,000, which is 75% of $8,000, and I'd get $4,000, which is 50% of $8,000.

I'll accept this offer.
