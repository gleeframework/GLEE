"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of my gain. This is fair considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 2:1 ratio in favor of my gain. Considering the inflation, this seems like a reasonable division. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
