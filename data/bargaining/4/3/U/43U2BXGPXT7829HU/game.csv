,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,I think we can do better than 90/10. Let's start with a 50/50 split and see if we can improve from here.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Since we're both taking losses due to inflation, I'm willing to compromise slightly.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable, considering the inflation and the fact that I'm the one making the offer this round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,I'm willing to meet you halfway on the 55/45 split. Let's agree on this and avoid further losses from inflation.,Alice,5,
