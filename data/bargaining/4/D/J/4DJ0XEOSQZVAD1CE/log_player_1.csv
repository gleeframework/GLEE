"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is just a friendly jab to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm taking a slight edge, but you're still getting a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the offer, I think I'll reject it. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're taking too big of an edge, I want more!""
}
```

Let's see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further!"
