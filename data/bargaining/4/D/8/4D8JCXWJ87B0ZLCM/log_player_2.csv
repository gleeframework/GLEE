""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation, Bob.  Let's compromise. I'll take a slightly smaller share to ensure we both get something.  How about 55/45?  It's still a fair split, and we can avoid the risk of losing everything with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working against her more strongly. While 45 is less than I want, I can push for a bit more in the next round. The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice will become, allowing me to secure a more favorable outcome."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is literally evaporating with each round.  My offer is 65/35. Take it now, and we both walk away with something substantial. Don't let greed cloud your judgment â€“ another rejection and we're both staring at zero.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept a 45/55 split to ensure we both get something before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has finally shifted to offering me the majority share, recognizing the impact inflation has on her returns. While I was aiming for 65, accepting 55 now guarantees a win and avoids the risk of getting nothing if Alice plays hardball for another few rounds."
