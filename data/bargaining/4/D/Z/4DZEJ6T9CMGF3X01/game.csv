8000.0,2000.0,I propose dividing the money with an 80-20 split in favor of Alice. This allows me to have a significant portion while still providing a substantial amount to Bob.,Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I think this is a more balanced split, considering the initial offer was quite skewed. I'm willing to give you a significant amount, but I need something fair in return.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6400.0,3600.0,"Considering the inflation and previous offers, I propose a 64-36 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while still providing a significant portion of the funds to Bob.",Alice,3,
