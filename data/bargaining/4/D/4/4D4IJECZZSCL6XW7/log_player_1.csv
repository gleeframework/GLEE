"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and we can discuss further from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd be getting 80% of $8,000, which is $6,400.

Bob's offer is $6,000 for me and $4,000 for him, which is a bit better than my original offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm getting the best deal. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80% = 64%). So, my target is to get as much as possible in today's dollars.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a good deal for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,600 and keeping $6,400 for myself, trying to maximize my share in the current economic conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle, let's try to find a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money in the current round:

Original $10,000 is now worth 40.96% of its original value (64% of 63.125% = 40.96%) due to the cumulative inflation.

My target is to get as much as possible in today's dollars. Bob's offer is $5,000 for me and $5,000 for him, which is a 50-50 split.

I think this is a fair offer, considering the current economic conditions. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""A 50-50 split seems reasonable given the circumstances.""
}
```"
