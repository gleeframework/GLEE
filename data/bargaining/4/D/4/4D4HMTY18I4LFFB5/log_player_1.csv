"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly reminder that we can end the game quickly if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  Let's end this game quickly! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so I need to adjust my calculation.

In this round, I would get $50, which is 50% of the current value of the money.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50/50 split, especially since I was hoping to get more. I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the decreasing value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the current value of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
