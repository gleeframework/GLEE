I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I'm hoping to get a better deal as the rounds progress and the value of the money decreases for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a more suitable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer. While Alice's offer reflects the inflation, it's still not a fair split considering the diminishing value of the money. I'm holding out for a better deal, especially since I have several rounds left to negotiate."

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer acknowledges inflation, it's still not fair considering the significant loss in value for me. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a more equitable split, especially since we have several rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, this is a reasonable split considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Even though time is running out, I'm still going to reject this offer. It's not fair to me given the significant value loss I'm experiencing due to inflation. I'm hoping Alice will realize that we need to find a more equitable solution before it's too late for both of us."
