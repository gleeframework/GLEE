"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since I lose money to inflation with every round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less to Alice with each passing round, I think I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. You lose money with each round, so it's better to accept now.""}\n\nI'm taking a slightly firmer stance, offering Alice a smaller share, but still trying to appear reasonable and taking into account the inflation factor to put some pressure on her to accept. Let's see how she reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting worse for me each round. Accept this and let's be done. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer as well. Since the money is worth less to Alice with each passing round, I'm in a stronger negotiating position. I'll try to take advantage of this and see if I can get an even better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""The longer we play, the less the money is worth to you. I think it's time for you to accept a smaller share. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.""}\n\nI'm taking an even firmer stance now, offering Alice an even smaller share. Given the increasing impact of inflation on her potential gain, I believe she'll be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is ridiculous.  Any more rounds and I'm losing money.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Despite Alice's message, I still have the upper hand in the negotiation due to the inflation factor. An even split would be a good deal for her at this point, but I think I can push for an even better deal in the next round, considering how much value she's losing with each passing round. Let's see how she reacts next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I understand you're getting frustrated, but the reality is that the longer we play, the less you'll get. I'm willing to end this now if you accept this offer. It's the best you'll get from me.""}\n\nAt this point, I'm trying to appear firm but still reasonable, emphasizing the impact of inflation on Alice's potential gains. Given how much value she's lost already, I believe she might be more willing to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more in the next round."
