"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end this quickly.  Inflation is a risk, but I want to maximize my gains in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to take more, this offer is fair and I don't want to risk Bob rejecting it and the money becoming worth even less."
