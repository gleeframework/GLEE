"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was hoping Bob would accept the initial offer, but I suppose I have to be more flexible.

Considering the new offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not sure if I'm comfortable with giving up $7000. However, I don't want to wait too long and risk losing more money due to inflation.

I'll accept the offer, but I'll have to negotiate harder next time to get a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
