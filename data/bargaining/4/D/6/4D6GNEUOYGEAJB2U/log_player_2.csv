"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think it's time for a fairer split.  This offer still gives you a good starting point, and avoids further inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  My offer is getting smaller with each round. This is still a generous offer for you. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
