"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer and the fact that the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

My current proposal was rejected, and now Bob is offering me $400,000, which is a significant decrease from the original $500,000 I proposed. However, I'm not sure if it's worth accepting, especially since Bob is keeping a larger share.

I'll reject this offer and propose a new one in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to propose a more favorable split for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a more balanced split, considering the original amount""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 460k, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value, and I need to be careful.

Considering the offer, I'm still not convinced that 460,000 is a good deal for me. The split is still slightly in Bob's favor, and I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair share.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation, so I need to be more cautious with my proposal.

Considering the previous offers and the fact that Bob's offers have been slightly in his favor, I'll try to propose a more aggressive split.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get a better share, but I'm not going to give up""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 520k, but I'm getting desperate and willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now. Considering the offer, I'm not sure if 520,000 is a good deal for me, but I'm also not sure if I can afford to wait for a better offer.

I'll have to weigh the pros and cons. On one hand, 520,000 is a significant amount, but it's still slightly less than I was hoping for. On the other hand, the inflation is making the money worth even less, so I might be better off accepting this offer and getting something rather than risking it all.

I'll accept this offer.
