"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this case, the 400,000 I would gain is equivalent to 437,500 in the original 1,000,000.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the 20% difference in the split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's still a decent offer. I'll choose to accept this offer.
