"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. With the current offer, I'll be getting 70% of $90 (the effective value of the money after two rounds of inflation), which is $63.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll think about it...

For now, I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less after the second round of inflation, the effective value of the money is now $81 (100 * 0.9 * 0.9).

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's settle this""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the effective value of the money, which is $44.55. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Let's calculate the effective value of the money after four rounds of inflation. The initial $100 is now worth:

$100 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.7273 = $56.36 (approximately)

With Bob's offer, I'd be getting 65% of $56.36, which is approximately $36.63. That's not bad, but I'm not sure if I should settle for it.

Considering the decreasing value of the money and the fact that Bob is getting a better deal, I'll think about it...

For now, I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money's value is decreasing rapidly!

After four rounds of inflation, the effective value of the money is approximately $56.36.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, it's getting desperate""
}
```

I'm offering to take 50% of the effective value of the money, which is $28.18. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
