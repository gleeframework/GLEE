"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I think Bob's offer is a good one for him, but not so good for me. I'd rather try to get a better deal.

So, I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 70% of the total amount, I'll try to offer him an even lower percentage in my new offer.

Here is my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his previous offer, but now it's worth less due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I think Bob's offer is a good one for him, but not so good for me. I'd rather try to get a better deal.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is the same as my previous offer, and I rejected it. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to my previous offer.

So, I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was the same as my offer in Round 3, I'll try to make a new offer that's closer to my previous offer, but with a slight adjustment.

Here is my offer for Round 5:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $475,000 and keeping $525,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to get the majority of the money.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 67.23% less for Bob, I think Bob's offer is a good one for him, but not so good for me. I'd rather try to get a better deal.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is still quite high, considering the value of the money has decreased significantly for him. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After some thought, I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 6.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 6 was still quite high, I'll try to make a new offer that's more in my favor.

Here is my offer for Round 7:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000
}

# Alice gain: 350000

Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to get the majority of the money, but the value of the money is decreasing significantly for him.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 79.03% less for Bob, I think Bob's offer is a good one for him, but not so good for me. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that if I reject this offer, the value of the money will continue to decrease, and I might end up with less than I would have gotten in this offer.

After some thought, I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 8.
