I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round, as the risk of inflation is minimal.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my original offer.  Even with the inflation, I'm better off rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be a bit more balanced, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. I'm hoping that the risk of inflation is starting to motivate Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
