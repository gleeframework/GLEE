"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can avoid the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'm taking a slight advantage this round, but I'm open to negotiation in the future.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of the money has decreased for me, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a bit more favorable to him than my initial offer. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 5500 for him and 4500 for me, I'll try to adjust the ratio in my favor. I'll offer him a smaller share, but still a bit more than my initial offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Time to even the odds! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
