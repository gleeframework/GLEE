"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you $200,000, a fair share, and we can move forward.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a significant portion, but I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair start, and we can both benefit from this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'd rather get a larger share now than risk waiting for a better offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's split it evenly. I'll take $500,000, and we can move forward.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we'll split the $1,000,000 evenly."
