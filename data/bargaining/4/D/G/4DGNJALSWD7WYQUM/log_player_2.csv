Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise, but just a bit 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Explanation: While Alice is offering slightly more, the impact of inflation is significant. It's worth risking another round to see if we can secure a better deal.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is eating our money!  Let's be fair and split it evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a little more, but I'm not going to 50/50 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Explanation:  The impact of inflation is becoming critical. While not ideal, accepting 43 is better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds, especially since Alice seems unwilling to move to a 50/50 split."
