"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a fair chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small portion of the money to see if he'll accept the deal quickly. My message is a hint that I'm willing to be generous, but also implies that I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more fair this time.  I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'd like a fair amount as well. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer and decide whether to accept or reject it.

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $4500 is actually equivalent to $3600 in the first round's value. And Bob's gain of $5500 is equivalent to $5250 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not convinced yet. I'd like to get a bit more, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate still at 20%, my offer will be worth even less in the next round. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer by $1500 from the previous round, but I'm still not giving up too much. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
