"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to the rapid inflation affecting my share.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the initiative:** By proposing first, I set the initial bargaining point.
* **Appearing fair, but with a time constraint:** The 60/40 split might seem fair on the surface, but the message emphasizes that my share loses value quickly. This encourages Bob to accept sooner rather than later.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While this is a decent starting point, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's not immediately convinced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better.  This split is more fair given the inflation rates affecting both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is simply a reversal of my initial offer, completely disregarding the difference in inflation rates we face. This indicates he's aiming for a slow game, hoping I'll panic as the value decreases. Rejecting shows I'm not easily swayed and will push for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want this settled. I'm proposing a compromise that acknowledges your position while still reflecting the time pressure on my end.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing flexibility:** I've moved closer to a 50/50 split, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Still advantageous:** The offer remains tilted in my favor, considering the faster inflation applied to my potential earnings.
* **Sense of urgency:**  The message subtly reiterates the time constraint, reminding Bob that delays hurt my position more than his.

This offer aims to strike a balance: appearing open to a deal while still prioritizing a favorable outcome given the game's rules."
