I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a mere $1.  I figure he'll be tempted to accept since it's better than nothing, but he might also think it's worth holding out for a bigger share in the next round. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept that! Even though I'm getting $1, it's still much better than nothing. I'm confident that I can do better in the next round.  Let's see what Bob's next offer is!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time I'm going for a fair split. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both better off with a 50/50 split than continuing to fight over a few extra dollars.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise!"
