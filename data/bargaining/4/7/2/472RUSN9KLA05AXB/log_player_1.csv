Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping to get a quick agreement.  I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, I'm getting 60% of the original value of $100. It's not ideal, but it's better than taking the risk of further rounds and potentially getting an even worse offer."
