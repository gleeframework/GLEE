"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 80/20, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. I'll offer 30/70. 

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Alice's offer is still relatively close to the original 80/20 split, I'll accept it.
