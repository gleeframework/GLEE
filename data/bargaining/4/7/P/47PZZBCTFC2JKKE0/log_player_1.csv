"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars.  This is a fair starting point, and I am willing to negotiate further.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer more, taking 50 dollars is better than getting nothing in 12 rounds.  It's a fair split, and I accept."
