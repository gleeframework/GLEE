"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this initial offer, I'm proposing a division where I, Alice, receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000, with a message suggesting a fair split. This division slightly favors me, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. Since the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob with each round, I'm aiming to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us, avoiding further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we need to take into account. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this round, considering the impact of inflation, Bob's offer doesn't seem as favorable. The money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the initial round. Given this devaluation, I believe I can propose a division in the next round that might be more advantageous for me, or at least find a better compromise. Thus, I choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer slightly, taking into account the decreased value of the money for both of us, but especially for Bob. By offering $5,800 for myself and $4,200 for Bob, I'm trying to find a balance that acknowledges the greater impact of inflation on Bob's share while still aiming for a mutually acceptable agreement. This adjustment shows a willingness to compromise, given the changing value of the money."
