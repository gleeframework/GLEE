Let's see if Bob takes my generous offer! ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not happy with that offer! I know I have the power to negotiate better in the next round. ðŸ˜‰"

I'll try a slightly lower offer this time, but I still think it's fair.  Let's see if Bob is more reasonable this time."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is getting greedy! I'm not going to settle for half, especially with the inflation eating away at my share. I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't let Bob take advantage of the inflation. This is my final offer before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Bob's offer is getting ridiculous!  I'm not going to let him get away with taking the lion's share while I lose more and more due to inflation. I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm taking a risk here, but I need to make a move. The inflation is getting out of hand, and I'm starting to lose faith in Bob's willingness to negotiate.  This offer is still a good one for him, but I'm hoping he realizes that we're both losing money with every passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is getting more and more greedy! I'm not accepting this offer. I'll try to make a better deal in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm taking a big risk here, but with inflation at this level, I need to try to salvage something. I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal for both of us, and hopefully, Bob sees that we're both losing money with every round.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
