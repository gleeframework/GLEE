Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep 90 dollars for myself and give Bob 10 dollars.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation will affect me more than it affects him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
