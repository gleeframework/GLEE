Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to end this quickly, but I need a bit more for it to be worthwhile for me. This offer is still generous to you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me a bit closer to the middle. This offer considers the time pressure and offers us both a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While he is acknowledging the shrinking pot, his offer still heavily favors him.  I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fair deal and won't be pressured into accepting a bad offer, even with the time constraint."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 560000,
""bob_gain"": 440000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a serious compromise, and it's the last one I'm making where I take the majority. Let's end this before we both lose out.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point. The longer the game goes on, the less we both gain.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is heavily impacting both of us. Holding out for a marginally better deal in later rounds isn't worth the risk of walking away with nothing. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, while not what I aimed for initially, is a fair outcome considering the circumstances. 

Bob likely realizes the time pressure is on and has made a reasonable final offer. Accepting now secures a decent outcome for both of us."
