"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you take 40%.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal, considering the inflation factor and the number of rounds we have left. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's consider the inflation, I'll take 55% and you take 45%. It's more fair this way.""}\n\n###\nI'm trying to take into account the inflation factor that affects both of us, but more severely impacts Alice. By offering her 45%, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that might be more appealing given the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We both lose money with each round, so let's make this quick. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the inflation rates, accepting 50% now would actually be less valuable than what I initially rejected in Round 1. I'm going to try and push for a better deal, considering Alice is losing value faster than I am. Maybe in the next round, I can propose something that takes into account the decreasing value for both of us but still leans slightly in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, I'll take 58% and you take 42%. The longer we wait, the less we both get, but your loss is steeper. This is a fair adjustment.""}\n\n###\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, especially on Alice's side, I'm trying to find a balance that acknowledges her greater loss over time while still aiming for a favorable outcome for myself. By slightly increasing my share, I'm applying gentle pressure while leaving room for negotiation. The message aims to convey a sense of urgency and fairness, considering the devaluing money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  Let's meet in the middle, with you taking 55% and me taking 45%.  The longer we wait, the less we'll both have. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains, especially on Alice's, her offer to meet at 55% for me and 45% for her seems reasonable at this point. The money's value is decreasing rapidly, and pushing for further rounds risks diminishing the value even more drastically. Accepting this offer secures a tangible gain, even if it's less than initially hoped for. It's a pragmatic decision to stem further loss due to inflation."
