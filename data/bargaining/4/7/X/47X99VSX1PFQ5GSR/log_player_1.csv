"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer
Given the rules of the game, it's strategic to start with an offer that is somewhat favorable to me (Alice) but not so extreme that Bob would refuse outright. A common starting point in negotiation games like this is to offer a division that is slightly more favorable to oneself but still reasonable.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation
Since the money's value decreases with each round, I want to end the game as quickly as possible to minimize the impact of inflation on my gain. Therefore, my initial offer needs to be attractive enough to Bob to consider accepting it in the first round.

### Step 3: Calculate the offer
A reasonable starting offer might be to propose that I (Alice) take 60% of the money and Bob take 40%. This division gives me a slight advantage but is not so skewed that Bob would immediately reject it, especially considering the money's decreasing value over time.

### Step 4: Formulate the message
To make the offer more appealing and set the tone for potential future negotiations, I'll include a message suggesting that this division is a fair starting point but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is not satisfied.

### Step 5: Construct the JSON offer
Based on the above steps, the offer and message to Bob in JSON format are as follows:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Starting with a 60-40 split seems fair considering the decreasing value over time, but I'm open to adjusting if needed.""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a good starting point, Alice. However, the decreasing value of the money hurts me more than it hurts you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us with this revised offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's Offer
Bob has proposed a division where I (Alice) gain 45% and he gains 55% of the money. Given the context that the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob (10%) than for me (5%) with each round, his willingness to find a compromise is understandable.

### Step 2: Consider the Impact of Inflation on Future Rounds
Since the money's value decreases with each round, and it affects Bob more than me, I might have a stronger negotiating position in subsequent rounds. However, I also need to consider that prolonging the game reduces the overall value of the money for both of us.

### Step 3: Assess the Reasonableness of the Offer
Bob's offer of 45% for me and 55% for him is a reversal of what might be expected given the original offer I made. Considering the impact of inflation and the desire to conclude the negotiation, the offer seems reasonable but slightly more favorable to Bob than I initially intended to accept.

### Step 4: Decide on the Offer
Given the decreasing value of money and the desire to end the negotiation sooner rather than later, accepting Bob's offer might be the most pragmatic decision. It ensures that both parties receive a significant portion of the money without further devaluation.

### Step 5: Construct the Response
Based on the above steps, my decision is to accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{accept}$"
