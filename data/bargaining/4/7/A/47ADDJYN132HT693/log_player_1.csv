"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 600,000 dollars. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my potential gain is now worth 5% less than the original 600,000, which is 570,000.

Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving him 750,000. However, I need to consider the fact that the money is worth less with each passing round, and I might not get a better offer in the next round.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
