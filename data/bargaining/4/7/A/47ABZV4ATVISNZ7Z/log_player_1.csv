Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, my offer in Round 1 was actually equivalent to $855,000, and Bob's offer in Round 2 is equivalent to $760,000.

Considering Bob's offer in Round 2 is quite lopsided, I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.
