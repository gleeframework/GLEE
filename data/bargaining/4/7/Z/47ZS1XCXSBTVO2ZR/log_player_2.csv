Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be stubborn, Bob. This is a fair deal! 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the effects of inflation are hitting hard, accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than half the money. While the rounds are progressing quickly, there's still a chance to negotiate a better deal. Alice seems to be consistently aiming for a 60/40 split, so Bob needs to hold firm to try and secure a larger portion before inflation eats away too much of his potential gains."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split! 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation has taken a serious toll. While this offer is still less than ideal, it's better to secure something now before inflation erodes the value even further. Accepting a 46/54 split, though not perfect, guarantees Bob a sizable sum, which is better than risking a complete loss if the rounds run out."
