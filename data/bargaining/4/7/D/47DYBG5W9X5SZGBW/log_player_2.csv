"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Take this deal 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is frustrating, but accepting a deal where I consistently get less than 50% is a losing strategy in the long run. The inflation hurts, but Alice seems content to drag this out. I'll hold out a little longer and hope she gets nervous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, take this 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation getting worse, I need to cut my losses.  Getting only $38 is much better than nothing, which is what I'll end up with if I keep rejecting her offers."
