"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share, but leaving Bob with a small amount to incentivize him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, taking 500,000 is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
