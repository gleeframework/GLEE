"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a 80-20 split. I think this is a fair starting point, and then we can discuss and adjust as we go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split, let's see if you agree 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more favorable to him than the first round, but I'm willing to accept it for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
