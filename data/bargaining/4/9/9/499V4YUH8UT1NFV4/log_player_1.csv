"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering Bob $2,000, and I'll take $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6000 is now worth 80% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's actually $4800 in ""real"" value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
