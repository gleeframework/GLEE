  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20 to start, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's new proposal, I'll think about it...

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not convinced that 40/60 is balanced, especially since I'm still taking a significant hit from inflation. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
