"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get 80 dollars and Bob gets 20 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable considering the current situation.

I accept the offer.
