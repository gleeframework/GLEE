"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation we need to consider. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I need to consider the 5% inflation, so the money I gain is worth 95% of the original amount. Since I was initially offered $60, I would get $57 (60 * 0.95).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I was initially offered $60, and now I'd only get $57, which is less than the $60 I was initially offered. I'm hoping to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. In Round 2, I was offered $57, and now I need to propose a new amount that takes into account the 5% inflation.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here!"
