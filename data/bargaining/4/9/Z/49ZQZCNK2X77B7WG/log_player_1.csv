"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can't do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd rather get a higher share to compensate for the loss. Bob's offer of 40 is still a decent one, but I'd like to try to get more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% less than the previous round, and 20% less than the initial 100$), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I need 60 to make up for inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 55, but I'm not giving in to inflation 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, my gain is worth significantly less. Bob's offer of 55 is a slightly better deal than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate continuing to rise, my gain is worth even less. I'll try to get a better deal, but I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70, but I think you're getting a good deal too""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give in, but I'm not getting anything left! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting desperate! With the inflation rate so high, my gain is worth a tiny fraction of its original value. While 80 is still a significant amount, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll think carefully before making a decision.
