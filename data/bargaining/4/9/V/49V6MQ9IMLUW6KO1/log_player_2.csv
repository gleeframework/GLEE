"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's worth waiting to see if Alice will give up more in a later round, as Bob's share will keep diminishing if he accepts."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I think this is a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still better to wait and see what she offers in the next round. The inflation rate is increasing, and Bob's share will keep diminishing if he accepts."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than that to make it worth the risk of inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll on your share, better accept this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though Alice is emphasizing the inflation factor, the offer is still not favorable. Bob's share is diminishing rapidly, but holding out for a better offer in the next round might be worth the risk. There are still several rounds left, and Bob's share could decrease further if he accepts now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 8000,
""alice_gain"": 2000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still need more than that to make it worthwhile given the inflation rate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing a lot to inflation, don't let it slip away 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is hitting hard, Bob's share is still too low. There are still a few rounds left, and holding out might be worth it to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 9000,
""alice_gain"": 1000,
""message"": ""The inflation is really hurting, but I'm willing to compromise if you meet me halfway.  Let's find a way to split this so we both get something.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is crippling your share, this is likely your last chance 
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is incredibly high, and Alice is highlighting the danger of it, Bob's share is too low. There are still a few rounds remaining, and the risk of losing a small amount more in the next round is outweighed by the potential of getting a more reasonable share in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 9500,
""alice_gain"": 500,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Inflation is taking a huge toll, but I'm willing to give you a small share to avoid losing everything. Let's reach an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, take what's left before it's worthless 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation has drastically reduced Bob's potential gains.  Even though it's a very small share, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets something. It's better than risking getting nothing at all in the final round."
