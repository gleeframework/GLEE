"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. I'm making a strong opening offer, but it's a fair one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. Let's go 95-5, a fair share for everyone. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already hitting me hard!

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not accept it. I'd like to keep more of the money. I'll reject his offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer now. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a sweet spot, 70-30, a compromise!""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a bit more, but still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, 80-20. We can both get a good share, and it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not accept it. I'd like to get a better share, considering the money is worth less and less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make another offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55-45. It's a fair split!""
}
```

This time, I'm aiming for a slightly more balanced split, considering the decreasing value of the money."
