Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I figure I'll take the lion's share, and Bob might just accept it to get something. The stakes are high, and I want to maximize my gains early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

This is a much fairer offer than my previous one, and I'm not sure I can do better with inflation kicking in.  It's time to take what I can get!"
