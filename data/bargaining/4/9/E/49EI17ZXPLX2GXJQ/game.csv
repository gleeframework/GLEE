600000.0,400000.0,I propose we divide the money 3:2 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution while considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"I'll give you a smaller share, but this way I'll get a decent amount while still keeping some for future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I propose an equal division of the remaining funds. This maintains fairness and ensures both of us receive a substantial amount without risking too much in case of further inflation.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm trying to conserve my share for future rounds when the money will be worth even less. I'll take a risk and hope you'll accept this offer.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
