# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While 7500 is a good amount, I can likely get a better deal by proposing myself and leveraging the fact that Alice doesn't know about the inflation effect."

# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000

I'm still not convinced this is a good deal. I'm aware of the inflation, but I think I can still get a better deal."

# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal. While the offer is tempting, I believe I can secure a larger share by continuing to negotiate. The inflation is a serious concern, but I'm willing to take the risk for a greater payoff."

The inflation is getting out of hand. This is the best deal I'm likely to get at this point.  I'm accepting to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
