"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. We can negotiate further if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous with the first offer, but I think I can do better. How about we split it 3:2 in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not give him 75% of the remaining amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 64% of its original value due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split the remaining amount 4:6. I'll take $400,000 and you can have $600,000.""
}
