"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I rejected your offer, but I'm willing to split the money closer to even.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation we're facing.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
