"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. It's a fair split, and I think we can both live with this. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants a 50/50 split. That's a bold move! 

However, I'm not ready to give up my advantage just yet. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to take advantage of Bob's earlier offer. Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still in the driver's seat. Your turn, Bob!"
