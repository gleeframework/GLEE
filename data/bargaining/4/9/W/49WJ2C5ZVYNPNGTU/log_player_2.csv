Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Analyze the situation
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round due to inflation, but the money Alice gains is still worth the same. I need to take this into account when making my offer.

### Step 2: Determine my minimum acceptable gain
Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me, I should aim to get more than 50% of the original amount to compensate for the loss in value. Let's calculate my minimum acceptable gain:
Minimum acceptable gain = 50 / (1 - 0.0975) = 55.41

### Step 3: Make an offer to Alice
Considering my minimum acceptable gain, I will make an offer that is slightly higher than this value to leave room for negotiation. I will also include a message to Alice explaining my reasoning.

### Step 4: Create the offer in JSON format
Here is my offer to Alice:
{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair.""}

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still trying to be fair, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the current offer from Alice
Alice's current offer gives me a gain of 47, which is lower than my minimum acceptable gain considering the inflation. I need to calculate the actual value of this offer after adjusting for inflation.

### Step 2: Calculate the adjusted value of Alice's offer
Adjusted value = 47 * (1 - 0.1855) = 38.29

### Step 3: Compare the adjusted value with my expectations
The adjusted value of 38.29 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable gain. I should reject this offer and continue negotiating for a better deal.

### Step 4: Decide on the response to Alice's offer
Based on the calculations, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Re-evaluate my minimum acceptable gain

### Step 2: Make an adjusted offer to Alice
Given the new minimum acceptable gain, I will make an offer that is slightly higher than this value to account for the increased inflation and leave room for negotiation. I will also include a message explaining my reasoning.

### Step 3: Create the offer in JSON format
Here is my adjusted offer to Alice:
