Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and inflation.  Let's close the deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous, take it 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, hoping the inflation will force me to accept a bad deal. While the offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm willing to risk it all to get a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose if this fails. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, this is the best you'll get 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While the offer is still not ideal, the inflation is eating heavily into my potential gains. Accepting 40 now is better than risking getting a worse offer or nothing at all in the later rounds.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this stage."
