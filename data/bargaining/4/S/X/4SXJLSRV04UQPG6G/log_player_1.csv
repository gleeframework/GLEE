I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement. Let's see if he's satisfied!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While my share is less than what I initially proposed, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money.  It's better to take what I can get now than risk further losses in the next round."
