"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. I'll also include a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should both get a little more than what you proposed, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 10% less in this round, Bob's offer of $400,000 is actually equivalent to $360,000 in the first round. Considering I initially offered Bob 40% and kept 60% for myself, I'm not willing to accept less than what I initially proposed, especially since Bob is still getting more than me in this offer. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob 45% of the money and keep 55% for myself. I'll also include a message saying ""Let's meet in the middle"" to try to find a compromise between our previous proposals. Since the money is worth less in each round, I'm willing to be a bit more flexible to try to reach an agreement."
