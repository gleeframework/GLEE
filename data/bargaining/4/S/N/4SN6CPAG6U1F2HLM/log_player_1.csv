"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55% and leave 45% for you. Let's end the game here.""
}
```

This offer gives me $550,000 and leaves $450,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair 20% and take the rest. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

My gain of $200,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $180,000 in the first round.

I'm not sure if 20% is fair, but it's better than nothing. I'll take the offer.
