"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This is a good deal for you in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money loses 20% of its value for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal than 30% of the initial amount in the first round. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can get a better proposal from Alice in the next round or have the opportunity to make a counteroffer that benefits me more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince Alice's offer was not acceptable, I'll make a counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable, taking into account the value of money decreasing for me. I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 4200,
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against you, Bob.  Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the money is worth 36% less for me now, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Accepting this offer would mean I'm getting less in real value compared to the first round, considering the inflation. I'm willing to take the risk of going into the next round to either get a better offer from Alice or make another proposal that could benefit me more, despite the decreasing value of the money for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nGiven the current state of inflation, where the money I gain is worth 36% less, I need to adjust my proposal to compensate for this loss. I'll aim for a higher nominal value to counteract the effects of inflation, while still trying to appear reasonable to Alice.

""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I propose an equal split to find a middle ground.""}"
