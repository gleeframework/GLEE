Let's see how this plays out for Bob in the next round with inflation. I think I can get a better deal."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I propose an equal split to find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** Inflation is significantly eroding Bob's potential gains. He's feeling the pressure, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Bob will propose even less favorable terms in the next round.  I risk ending up with nothing if we can't agree before the time runs out.
* **Fairness:** While not ideal, a 50/50 split is at least fair on the surface. It shows a willingness to compromise. 

It's important to be strategic in negotiation games like this. Sometimes, accepting a less than ideal offer is the smartest move to ensure you walk away with something."
