"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more as I'm starting the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the 10% inflation, I'd rather try to get a better deal than accept 400,000 that will be worth less in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's rebalance the scales a bit, considering the inflation.""}\n\nSince I'm making the offer in this round, I've taken into account the inflation that affected both of us. Alice's money is worth 5% less now, and mine is worth 10% less. Given this, I'm aiming to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us, while also trying to get a slightly better deal for myself. The message is brief and to the point, explaining the reasoning behind my offer. Let's see how Alice reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation hurts you more than me, Bob. Let's be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nConsidering the current inflation rates and how they affect both of us, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Alice's offer doesn't seem to fully account for the potential future losses I'll incur due to the higher inflation rate affecting me. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make another offer that might better balance our gains considering the inflation. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation gap, let's find a compromise.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the growing difference in how inflation affects us. Since my potential gains are worth 19% less and Alice's are worth 9.75% less than initially, I'm aiming to find a middle ground. My offer slightly favors me to compensate for the higher devaluation of my potential gains, but still remains reasonable for Alice. The message is concise, emphasizing the need for a compromise due to the increasing impact of inflation. Let's see how Alice responds!"
