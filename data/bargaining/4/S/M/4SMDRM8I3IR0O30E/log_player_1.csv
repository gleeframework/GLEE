"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor. You can try to negotiate if you want more!""
}
```

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to set a high bar for Bob to beat!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll adjust my gain accordingly. In this round, the total amount is $9,000 ($10,000 * 0.9).

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think a 60-40 split in your favor is fair, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the total amount is now $9,000 ($10,000 * 0.9^2).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```"
