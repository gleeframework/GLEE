"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer was rejected, and now Bob is making a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I'll think carefully...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 70% to him and 30% to me, I'll try to counter with a more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}"
