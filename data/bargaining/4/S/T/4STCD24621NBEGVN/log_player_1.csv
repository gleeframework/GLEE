{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share this round""}

I'm proposing that I take 6000 and Bob takes 4000. I'm trying to be fair and give Bob a decent share, while also keeping a bit more for myself."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the bigger share this round, but I'll give you a small chunk 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking the bigger share, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. 2000 is a relatively small share, and I'm not convinced it's a good deal. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm trying to be more generous this time, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and make a better offer."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because 3000 is still a relatively small share, and I'm not convinced that Bob is being generous enough. I'm willing to wait and see if Bob comes back with a better offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:
