Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's a tough one to swallow with the inflation looming. How about I bump my offer to $6,300 and you get $3,700?  Every round counts, my friend. 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value for you diminishes quickly. I'm offering $6,500 for me and $3,500 for you.  This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting worse for me, I'm banking on Alice not wanting to risk getting $0. I need to push for a better deal while it's still somewhat worthwhile.  We're approaching a critical point, but I believe I can still get her to agree to a more even split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. I'm offering a slight advantage to you, acknowledging the situation. It's the best you'll get. Take it before inflation eats away even more!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and I need to make a move that seems both urgent and appealing to Alice. By offering her slightly more than half, I acknowledge the game's dynamics while still securing a decent portion for myself.  This offer balances my desire for a fair share with the very real risk of getting nothing if we reach later rounds."
