"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $600,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $540,000. And Bob's offer is 50% each, which is $500,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
