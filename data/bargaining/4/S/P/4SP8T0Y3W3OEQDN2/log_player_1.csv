"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer aims to secure a large portion of the money while leaving Bob with a small amount to potentially incentivize him to accept in the first round.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get 500,000, which is better than the 450,000 I would get if I reject and continue to the next round.  There's no guarantee that Bob will make such a fair offer again, and the risk of getting nothing is too high."
