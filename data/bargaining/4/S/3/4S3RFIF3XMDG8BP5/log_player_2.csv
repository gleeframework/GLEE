Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims to be generous, the inflation rate is working heavily against me. Accepting this offer would mean losing over a third of the potential value compared to the first round.  I need to incentivize Alice to settle sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and we both lose with every delay. This is my final offer before I'm forced to be more aggressive to compensate for inflation.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being patient 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation rate is severely impacting my potential gains. While this offer is far from ideal, it's becoming too risky to continue rejecting. If I wait any longer, the effects of inflation will outweigh any potential gains from a better offer in later rounds."
