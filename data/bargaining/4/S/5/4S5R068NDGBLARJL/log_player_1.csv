"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk to keep things friendly""
}
```

This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and we can see how the game goes from here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to get a better deal next round 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 3000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to 2700 in the first round's value. Bob's gain of 7000 is still worth 7000 in the first round's value.

I'm not too happy with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now and try to do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain will be worth even less in the next round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share to make it worth my while""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much ground 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at my gains! Considering the inflation, my gain of 3500 is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to 7290 in the first round's value. Bob's gain of 6500 is still worth 6500 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I think I'll accept it. I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal next round, and I don't want to risk losing out on 7290.
