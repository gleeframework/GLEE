Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. I'll take $55, leaving $45 for you. This is a fair split, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
