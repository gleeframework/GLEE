"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this good offer or you'll regret it next round. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll take my chances in the next round. The threat of inflation doesn't scare me that much, and I believe I can get a better deal. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation, I'm being generous.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm giving you one more chance, Bob. The clock is ticking and the money is shrinking, especially for you. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll take the risk again. Even though the money is worth less now, I think I can still get a better deal than this. Alice's offer is not generous enough, considering the inflation is affecting me more. I'll make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is hitting me harder, I think this is a fair offer. You're still getting a good deal, Alice.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before the inflation eats up all your potential winnings! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential winnings, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. The difference in the amount I gain is becoming less significant with each round, and I risk losing more if I continue to reject offers. Alice's message is right; the inflation is eating up my potential winnings, and I should take what I can get now."
