"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor. While this is a fair offer, I believe I can do better by rejecting and seeing what she proposes in the next round. The inflation will hurt her more than me, so she may be willing to concede more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fairer deal, considering inflation will affect us both differently. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be more to compensate for the loss 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage, but her offer is still too generous to her. I'll reject and see if she's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""We're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on the 55/45 split, but I'm firm on this offer.  Let's end this before the inflation hurts us both too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bit more to offset the inflation loss 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I think is fair, and the inflation is hurting her more than me now. Accepting this offer will save us both from further losses."
