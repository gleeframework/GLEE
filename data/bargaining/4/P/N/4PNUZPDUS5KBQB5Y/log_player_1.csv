"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  It's the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'd like to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the even split suggestion, Bob, but I'd like to get a bit more considering the inflation. Let's try again!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40% less now due to inflation. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and take less for myself. Let's see if we can agree on this split!""
}
```"
