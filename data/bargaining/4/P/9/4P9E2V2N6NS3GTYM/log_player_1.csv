Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. With my share of $5,000 being worth a significant amount less than it was in the first round, I'm not sure if I should accept this 50/50 split.

However, considering the severe inflation effect, I think this might be the best offer I'll get. I'll accept Bob's offer.
