"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, giving me a slight advantage, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if Bob will accept!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain, but Bob's gain is affected even more. Considering this, I'll decide to reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, the inflation has reduced the value of the money even further. Considering this, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, the value of the money has decreased rapidly. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a relatively fair deal considering the current value of the money. I'll decide to accept this offer.
