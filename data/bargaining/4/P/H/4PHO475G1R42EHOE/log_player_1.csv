"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000$ and Bob getting 400,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than 60-40. Let's try 65-35.   
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new numbers, my gain of 350,000$ is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually 480,000$. And Bob's gain of 650,000$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually 380,000$.

I'm not sure I like this offer... I'd rather not give up so much. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation. My gain of 350,000$ is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually 384,000$. Bob's gain of 650,000$ is now worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually 364,250$.

Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, 50-50""
