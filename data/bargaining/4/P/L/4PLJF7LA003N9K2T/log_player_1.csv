"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to propose a very unequal split. I figure Bob is likely to be risk-averse and accept even a small amount in the first round rather than risk getting nothing at all. Let's see how it plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm getting a lot more than Bob's initial offer, I still think I can get a better deal. The inflation is going to hurt Bob more than it hurts me, so I'm going to try to leverage that to get a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground. I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, but I'm still keeping a larger share.  With each round, the value of Bob's share decreases due to inflation, so I believe this is a fair offer that he might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While Bob's offer is significantly higher than the last round, I believe I can still get a better deal.  Inflation is working in my favor, and Bob is clearly feeling the pressure. I'm going to try to push for a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to raise my offer again, hoping to find a compromise that Bob will accept. The inflation is really starting to hit him hard, and I think he's feeling the pressure to agree to a deal. This offer gives him a larger share than the previous round, but still leaves me with a majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is significantly higher than the previous round, I'm still going to reject it. Inflation is clearly hitting him hard, but I'm going to stick to my strategy of pushing for a more even split. With only six rounds remaining, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, but not by much. With only 6 rounds left, I need to start considering Bob's pressure. I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for him to accept, but if not, I'll need to recalibrate my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than the previous round, I still believe I can secure a better deal. The pressure is mounting on Bob, and the value of his share is plummeting with each passing round. I'm going to continue to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer one last time. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal for myself and ensuring that Bob doesn't completely lose interest in the negotiation.  This offer still gives me a larger share, but it's a significant increase from the previous round, and it reflects the increasing pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the pressure is definitely mounting, I'm going to reject this offer.  The gap between our offers is still quite large, and the inflation is clearly having a significant impact on Bob.  I think I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

With only three rounds remaining, the stakes are getting very high.  I'm going to increase my offer again, but not by much.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally see that he's better off accepting this deal rather than risking getting nothing at all.  This offer leaves me with a majority, but also gives Bob a significant share, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one!  I'm getting a very small amount, but with only one round left, it's better than getting nothing.  The inflation has significantly reduced Bob's bargaining power, and he's clearly desperate to get any money at all. While I would have preferred a more even split, I'll take what I can get at this point."
