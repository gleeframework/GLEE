"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering I'm losing 10% value each round. This offer is more balanced, and we both get a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
