"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take most of the money but you get a small share. I'm hoping we can work out a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's offer is not fair, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'll try to wrap up the negotiations as soon as possible.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'll propose a division that benefits both of us while keeping the inflation in mind.\n\n###\n\nNext round, please!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation and tries to find a middle ground between Alice's initial offer and a more equitable split.\n\n###\n\nHere's my offer in JSON format:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering I'm losing 10% value each round. This offer is more balanced, and we both get a significant share.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice and let me know her decision.\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping Alice will see the reasoning behind my proposal and accept it, or at least make a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round. The pressure of inflation is on me, so I need to negotiate efficiently!"
