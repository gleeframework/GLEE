"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

This is a pretty aggressive offer. I'm hoping to get the majority of the money right off the bat. 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all if we don't come to an agreement.  Let's take it!"
