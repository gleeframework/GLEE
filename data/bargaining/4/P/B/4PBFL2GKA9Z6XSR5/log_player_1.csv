"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference a bit more this time, Alice. Time is ticking! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
Explanation:

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still heavily in his favor considering the inflation rates.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point where I'm losing significantly more value than Bob over time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. This offer acknowledges the time pressure and gives us both a decent share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the shrinking pot. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is inching closer to a more even split, but the deal is still not favorable enough considering the faster rate of inflation affecting my gains. I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept an offer where I lose significantly more value due to the time pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise. It accounts for the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable share. Let's close this deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Take it before inflation eats away any more! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal at the start, given the rapidly increasing inflation working against me, accepting Bob's offer now ensures I get a decent amount of the remaining value. Holding out for a slightly better deal is too risky at this point."
