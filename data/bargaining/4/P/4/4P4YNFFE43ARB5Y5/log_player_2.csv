"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous today, Bob. Take this small token as a gesture of goodwill. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While $1,000 is a lot of money, it's a tiny fraction of the total. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a more equitable split. This ensures we both benefit significantly from this opportunity."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  This offer ensures we both get a good portion of the money. Let's end this game and split the pie. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is working against her, so she'll be feeling more pressure to make a better deal soon. I think I can push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice, and the value is eroding. My offer is more than fair - let's wrap this up and both walk away happy."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be smart. We both lose money with each round. A 50/50 split ensures we maximize our gains. Let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a great outcome! While I initially aimed for a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split now makes the most sense. The inflation is significantly impacting Alice's potential gains, leading her to a more equitable offer. Accepting now ensures we both walk away with a substantial sum."
