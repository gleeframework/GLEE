I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give $1,000 to Bob.  This is a fairly generous offer for the first round, but I want to see if Bob will take it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I propose to keep $5,500 for myself and give Bob $4,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but I think it's fair considering he rejected my previous offer."
