"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something. However, I'm aware of the inflation and will need to be more strategic in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd ideally like more, with the inflation kicking in, taking half is a much better deal than risking getting nothing in the end."
