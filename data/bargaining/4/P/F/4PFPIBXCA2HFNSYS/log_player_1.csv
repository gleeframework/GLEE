I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure a good share early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, with inflation kicking in and only 11 rounds remaining, this is a fair offer that ensures I get at least something.  It's better to take half now than risk getting nothing later."
