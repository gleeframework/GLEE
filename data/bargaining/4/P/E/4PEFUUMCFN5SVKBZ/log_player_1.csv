"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $100.

Bob's offer is 40 for me, which is 40% of the original $100, and 60 for him, which is 60% of the original $100.

I'll reject this offer since I think I deserve a bit more than 40% of the original $100. I'll wait for Bob's next offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation (10% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the decreased value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think 55 is still too low 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $100.

Bob's offer is 45 for me, which is 45% of the original $100, and 55 for him, which is 55% of the original $100. This is actually the same offer I made in Round 3, but now the value of the money has decreased due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer since I was hoping for a higher percentage, and I don't want to accept the same offer that I previously rejected.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 40.9% less than the original $100 due to inflation, I'll aim for an even higher percentage to account for the decreased value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more now""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 58, but I think I'm getting close to a fair split 
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $100.

Bob's offer is 58 for me, which is 58% of the original $100, and 42 for him, which is 42% of the original $100.

I'll accept this offer since it's closer to what I was hoping for in Round 5, and it's a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation.
