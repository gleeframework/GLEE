"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, a 55/45 split seems fair. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too generous for you, Bob. I'll need a better split to compensate for the lost value.""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and hoping Bob will come back with an even better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly better split this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 60% this round, but I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further."
