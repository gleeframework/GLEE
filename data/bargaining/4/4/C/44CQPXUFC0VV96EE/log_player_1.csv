"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going for a high initial offer to see if Bob is willing to accept a small portion, especially since I know the money is worth less to me in later rounds.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While I'm losing value on my money with each round, I still stand to gain more by continuing to negotiate. I think I can get a better deal than $2,000, especially since it's only worth 80% of that now.  Let's see what I can get in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to try to get closer to a 60/40 split.  Since the money is worth less to me now, I need to make sure I get a decent chunk to make it worthwhile. Let's see if Bob is willing to give up some of his gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm going to accept this offer. While I'm losing value on my money with each passing round, I'm starting to reach a point where it's more beneficial to take what I can get rather than risk getting nothing.  I'm also not sure how much longer I can hold out, as Bob seems to be getting increasingly aggressive. Let's end this before the value drops even further."
