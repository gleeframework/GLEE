Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a smaller share, hoping he'll accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though inflation is working against me, a 50/50 split is a fair offer. It's better than risking getting a worse offer in the next round."
