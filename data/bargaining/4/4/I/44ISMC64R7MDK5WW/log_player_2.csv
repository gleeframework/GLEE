"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio. However, I'll give myself a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation effect.

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Alice's offer is still relatively close to the 30/70 ratio I proposed in the previous round, and it's slightly more favorable to me, I'll consider accepting this offer.
