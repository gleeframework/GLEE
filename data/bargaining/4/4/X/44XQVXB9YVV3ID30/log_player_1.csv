"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, a fair split, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of 300,000 in the second round is actually worth 270,000 in real value compared to the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 300k. I'll reject his offer.
