"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it might seem fair at first glance,  remember, the money will be worth less with each round. I can try to get a better deal for myself!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this time! I think this is a fairer split, considering how the money depreciates.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering depreciation! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Alice's offer. Even though I would have preferred my original proposal, the depreciation is starting to bite. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a worse deal later."
