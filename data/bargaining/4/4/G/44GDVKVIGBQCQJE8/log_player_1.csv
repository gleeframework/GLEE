"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a very aggressive offer, but it's important to remember that Bob's money is worth less with each round. If he rejects, he'll be getting even less in the next round.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him, and worse for me. Since I'm in a much better position to get a bigger share in the next round, I'll reject his offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm taking into account the inflation factor.  Bob's money is worth less each round, so I'm offering him a slightly higher share than in the first round, hoping to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still heavily in his favor, and I'm still in a good position to get a better deal.  The inflation is hurting both of us, but Bob is taking the bigger hit.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to account for the increasing inflation, but I'm still aiming for a large share. This is a good compromise, considering Bob's money is worth significantly less than it was at the beginning of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more equitable split, it's still heavily in his favor.  The inflation is impacting him more significantly, so I can likely secure a better deal for myself in the next round. I'll reject and continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

This is a risky offer because Bob is losing more and more money each round due to inflation. However, I think he might be more inclined to accept this offer than a more aggressive one, as he has rejected all of my previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though inflation is hurting Bob more than me, I still feel I can secure a better deal.  I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a more favorable split for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my offer to account for the increasing inflation. However, I believe Bob's shrinking share might make him more likely to accept this offer. He's losing more and more each round, and I'm aiming for a split that's still fair, but slightly more in my favor."
