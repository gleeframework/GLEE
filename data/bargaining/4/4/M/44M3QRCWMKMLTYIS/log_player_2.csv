"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation rate difference. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, it's heavily skewed in her favor due to the inflation difference.  I need to negotiate for a larger share in the earlier rounds to make up for the rapid devaluation of the money for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer doesn't adequately account for the rapid inflation impacting my share. I propose a revised split that better reflects the time pressure on my side.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I've adjusted my offer. It's still more favorable to me due to the lower inflation rate I'm experiencing. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but it's still not enough to offset the rapidly devaluing money from my perspective.  Another round of rejection might push her further towards a more agreeable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 620000,
""alice_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. This offer reflects the urgency for me to secure a larger portion before inflation erodes its value further."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to account for the difference in inflation rates. Let's settle on this before further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure and is moving closer to a more even split. However,  a 45/55 split after five rounds of inflation still puts me at a significant disadvantage. I'm willing to risk another rejection to see if I can get her closer to 48/52."
