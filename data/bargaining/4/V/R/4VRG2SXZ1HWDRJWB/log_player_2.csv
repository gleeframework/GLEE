"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but I'm willing to share some with you. If you accept, we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Although it might seem tempting to take the $1000, it's a very bad deal for Bob in the long run. Alice is taking the vast majority of the money.  Bob can definitely negotiate for a much better outcome in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split for us, Alice. This way we both benefit significantly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm still not satisfied. Let's meet in the middle - I'll take 6000, and you can have 4000. This way we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is simply repeating Bob's previous offer, which is beneficial for her.  Since Bob is the one experiencing inflation, he needs to be more assertive to avoid getting a worse deal with each passing round. Accepting now would mean settling for even less than what he could have potentially gained in the previous round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a solution soon. I'm proposing a split that leans in my favor considering the inflation. This offer is fair and ensures we both walk away with a good amount.""}"
