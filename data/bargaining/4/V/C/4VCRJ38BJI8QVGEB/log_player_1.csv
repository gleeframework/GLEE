"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This is a bold opening offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be eager to start the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair and square offer indeed!
