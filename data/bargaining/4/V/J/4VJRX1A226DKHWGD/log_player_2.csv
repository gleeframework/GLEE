""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think I can offer something that benefits us both. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  This accounts for the fact that future rounds are more costly for you due to inflation.""}

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split.  Every round costs me, and you're not being realistic about the impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
