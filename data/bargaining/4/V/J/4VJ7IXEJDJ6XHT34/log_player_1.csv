"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to the middle 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of $6,000 is now worth $5,700.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
