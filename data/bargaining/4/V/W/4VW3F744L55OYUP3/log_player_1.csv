"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money over time.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the time value of money for both of us. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm thinking... Bob's offer is better than what I would get if I rejected and proposed the same split in the next round.
