"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  This is a good starting point for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation rate will impact Alice more heavily than me.  Let's get this done.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  Inflation is impacting us both, and I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, the inflation is hurting Alice much more than me. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee I get something, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
