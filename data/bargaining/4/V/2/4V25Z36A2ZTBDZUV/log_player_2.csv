"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive losses from inflation. This gives us both a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to avoid further inflation losses.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping Alice will see the sense in splitting the money evenly, considering the looming threat of inflation. This way, we both get a substantial share without further diminishing the value of the money."
