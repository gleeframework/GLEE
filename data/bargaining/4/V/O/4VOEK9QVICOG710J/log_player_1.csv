"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000. This is a fair initial offer as it accounts for the fact that I am the one proposing the split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is not worth my while! Although I'm losing 20% of my money's value each round, I'm better off rejecting and forcing Bob to offer me more.  I will make a better offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself. While my offer has decreased due to inflation, it's still a better deal than the previous round.  I hope Bob sees this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the previous round in terms of absolute value, it's still not worth it for me due to the substantial inflation. I am losing almost half the value of my money from the first round, so I need a much larger portion to make this worth my while. I will continue to negotiate and hopefully get a more equitable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With the inflation rate increasing, I recognize that I need to be more flexible. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I hope Bob will accept. This offer is fair and reflects the significant devaluation of money we both face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is a difficult decision, given the significant inflation. However, the money is worth much less now, and further rounds will only reduce its value further. It's time to secure a deal, even if it's less favorable than I initially hoped."
