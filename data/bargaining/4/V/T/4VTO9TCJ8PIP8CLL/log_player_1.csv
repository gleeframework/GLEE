"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, while giving Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because it's not as favorable to me as my initial offer, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share of the reduced-value money, while still leaving Bob with a significant portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased rate of inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer for round 4. The decreasing value of the money makes it a more attractive option than waiting for another round, and I'm willing to settle for a smaller share of the reduced-value money."
