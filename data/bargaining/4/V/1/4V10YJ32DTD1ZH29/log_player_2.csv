Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable,  accepting now would set a bad precedent and likely lead to even worse offers from Alice in the future.  We still have time, and it's worth holding out for a better deal."

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous by not taking more 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using classic pressure tactics, but the math doesn't lie. We're getting closer to the point where her offers will be genuinely worse than taking nothing due to inflation. Holding out for one more round might make her realize we're serious about getting a fair deal."
