"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I have an incentive to finish the game as quickly as possible. However, accepting 30% of the money in the first round might not be the best option, considering Alice gets a significantly larger share. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose a more favorable division in the next round, potentially securing a better deal before the value of the money decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the decreasing value of money for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and the value keeps decreasing for you. This offer is still fair. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nReasoning: Although the value of the money for me has decreased by 36% compared to the first round, accepting 35% of the original amount still seems less favorable, especially since Alice's share remains significantly higher. Given that we are only in the third round out of twelve, there's still room to negotiate for a better deal. Rejecting this offer allows me to propose another division that might be more equitable or at least more advantageous for me, considering the ongoing devaluation of the money from my perspective."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Given the decreasing value for me, an equal split seems reasonable at this point.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to look out for myself too. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nReasoning: At this point, considering the money's value has decreased by 59.04% for me, and Alice claims this is her final offer, accepting 40% of the original amount might be the best option. The significant decrease in value due to inflation means that prolonging the game further risks leaving me with a negligible amount. Given the circumstances, accepting this offer seems more prudent than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
