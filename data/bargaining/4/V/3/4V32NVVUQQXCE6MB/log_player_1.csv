I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.  It's time to turn the tables."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a decent share. He knows his offers are getting less valuable each round.  Hopefully, he'll see the logic in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly unreasonable with his offers. I won't accept this and will counter with a better deal in the next round.  This game is getting interesting!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm sticking to my guns and offering a slightly lower amount for myself. Bob is losing out more with each round, so I'm hoping he'll finally see reason and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's greed is getting ridiculous! This offer is far too low, considering the inflation impacting him far more than me. I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm still willing to compromise, but Bob needs to start taking this seriously.  Inflation is hitting him hard, and he's losing out on a significant portion of his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming delusional! The inflation is hitting him hard, but he's still clinging to this ridiculous offer. I'm not giving in.  It's time to show him who's in control!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With Bob's ridiculous offers, I'm going to propose an even split. It's time for a fair compromise. I'm sure he'll recognize the value of taking this offer before things get worse for him!"
