"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, Bob loses value more slowly than Alice. It's in Bob's best interest to wait for a better offer. As the rounds progress, Alice's share will be worth less to her, making her more likely to offer a larger portion to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand you want to finish quickly, but my patience is worth more than that.  Let's try this again.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Turn the tables:**  By offering a 60/40 split in his favor, Bob puts the pressure on Alice. This mirrors her initial offer but takes advantage of the changing value.
* **Time pressure:** Bob's message reminds Alice that he's aware of the devaluation.  Each round makes her offer less appealing to her.
* **Negotiation:**  While a 50/50 split might seem fair in a vacuum, this scenario rewards the patient player. Bob is aiming for a more favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. We're both losing value with each round, so how about we split it closer to 50/50? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure, but it's not enough yet. Here's why Bob should hold out:

* **Favorable Trend:** Alice is moving closer to a 50/50 split, indicating her willingness to negotiate. This suggests Bob has room to push for a slightly better deal.
* **Inflation Advantage:**  The devaluation heavily favors Bob. While a 45/55 split seems like a minor difference, the actual value remaining for Alice makes this worthwhile for Bob to reject.
* **Final Round Leverage:** If Bob rejects this offer, he gets to make the final proposal in round 4. This gives him significant bargaining power, as Alice will be desperate to avoid further devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:** Bob leverages his final-round advantage to push for a slightly better split than Alice's last offer. He knows Alice is highly motivated to avoid another round of devaluation.
* **Bold but Realistic:**  While a 60/40 split in Bob's favor might be tempting, it risks alienating Alice and pushing her to gamble on a final round. This 55/45 split offers a compromise that still significantly favors Bob.
* **Firm Language:** The message uses language like ""final offer"" to convey seriousness and urgency, adding pressure on Alice to accept."
