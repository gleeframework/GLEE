Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

**Reasoning:**

While time is running out, Alice is still consistently offering deals where she gets a significantly larger share.  The inflation is hurting both of us, but I need to hold out for a more balanced deal. Accepting now would mean losing out on a significant amount of potential earnings."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Last chance before it's almost worthless 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is running out. While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting Alice's offer now ensures we both get something before inflation eats away too much more. It's better to take a smaller share than risk ending up with nothing."
