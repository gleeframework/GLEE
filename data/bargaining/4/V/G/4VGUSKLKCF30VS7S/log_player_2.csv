"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is fair, especially since we're losing value with each round.  Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
