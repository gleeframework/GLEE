"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, with 90% for me and 10% for you. It's a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 1000$ is something, the inflation will severely hurt me in the long run if I accept this offer. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. This way we both get an equal share of the money, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our profits in later rounds.""
