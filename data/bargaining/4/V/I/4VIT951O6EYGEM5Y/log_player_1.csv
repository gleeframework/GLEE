"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 900,000 for myself and give Bob 100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small amount while I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose to keep 600,000 for myself and give Bob 400,000.  I'm increasing his share from the first round, but still ensuring a larger portion for myself. This should be a more favorable offer for Bob, considering inflation is affecting his share more than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is now better for me, as I am getting 450,000 while Bob gets 550,000. Even though inflation is hitting him hard, I believe this is a fair deal and I should accept it before his offer gets even worse."
