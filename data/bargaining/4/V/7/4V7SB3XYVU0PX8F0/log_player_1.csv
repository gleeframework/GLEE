**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further inflation. 

* **My perspective:**  I've already lost almost 15% of the potential value due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only hurt me more. 
* **Bob's perspective:** He's losing value even faster (27.1%).  It's unlikely he'll offer me anything significantly better in future rounds, as he's motivated to settle quickly too. 

A 50/50 split ensures I get a reasonable share, and avoids the risk of ending up with a worse deal if the negotiations drag on."
