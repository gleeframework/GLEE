"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the $100 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice, given the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and while 30% is something, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a higher percentage for myself.  Let's see what happens in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the risk of inflation. We both get a good share, and it's less risky for me to accept this offer in the long run.""}
