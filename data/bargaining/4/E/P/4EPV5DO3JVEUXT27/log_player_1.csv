"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but also making it clear that I'm taking the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair for me to get only $2,000 when Bob is getting $8,000. I was hoping for a more equal split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. I'm trying to be more generous than my initial offer, but still holding out for a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still the one making the proposal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 30-70 split, especially since the money is worth even less now due to inflation. I was hoping for a better deal, and I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'll try to negotiate again and aim for a more equal split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, it's the fairest way""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting $5,000 and Bob getting $5,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
