Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split.  Let's try 60/40, with me getting the bigger share this time.  We can alternate who gets the bigger share in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
