"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. I figure I'll get most of the money if Bob is willing to accept this early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than my previous offer, I think I can still get a better deal if we continue playing. The inflation hurts Bob more than me, so he might be more willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to try a more moderate offer this time.  I figure I can still get a good portion of the money, and Bob might be more willing to accept as the inflation is starting to impact him more heavily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really starting to bite now. While I'd prefer to get more, it's getting increasingly likely that we'll just keep going back and forth, and my share will continue to shrink.  I think I'll take this offer before it gets even worse."
