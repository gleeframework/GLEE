"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work things out in the next round if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer seems generous, it's important to remember that the money will be worth less in the next round.  Rejecting this offer means I get to propose in the next round and have a better chance of getting a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
