"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

I accept this offer.
