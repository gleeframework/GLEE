"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 750,000 to 250,000, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth even less, so I need to be cautious. Since Alice's offer is now 50-50, I'll take it.
