"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even though Alice's proposal seems fair at first glance, I know that the money will be worth less in the next round. I'll try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than an even split. Since I'm the one making the proposal now, I'll take a slightly larger share, but you still get a decent amount.  Let's see what you think.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's adjust our shares. I propose you receive a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value of money. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I didn't get my ideal split, Alice's offer is a good one considering inflation. I'd rather take the 4600 now than risk losing more money in the next round."
