Alice's offer is closer to what I was aiming for in the previous round, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll reject this and see if she's willing to budge further."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: 50/50 split, can't get fairer than that 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, the inflation is hitting hard and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  50/50 is a fair compromise, and it's better than risking everything."
