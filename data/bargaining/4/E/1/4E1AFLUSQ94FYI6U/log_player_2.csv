Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is literally money for us in this game, and more so for you with the faster inflation. I'm proposing a slightly better split than your last offer, but we need to close this deal soon. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
