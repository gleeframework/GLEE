Alice is getting desperate, and the inflation is significantly impacting her potential gains. Holding out longer could force her to offer an even larger share."

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  By framing this as a ""final offer,"" we increase the pressure on Alice. She knows time is running out, and further delays will only benefit me.
* **Slight Concession:** While the offer is still heavily in my favor, I've increased Alice's share slightly to make it seem like I'm negotiating in good faith.  This might make her more likely to accept, thinking it's the best she'll get.
* **Highlighting Inflation:**  The message continues to emphasize that inflation is working against her, reinforcing the urgency of the situation."
