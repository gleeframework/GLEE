"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can seal the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm trying to make a good first impression and set a positive tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice! I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm not ready to settle yet!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with each of us getting 40% of the remaining value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure you're serious about meeting in the middle, Alice. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to test my resolve! I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'd like to make sure I get a slight edge.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will make a more favorable one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, Bob. Let's make a deal before the value drops further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, with me getting 55% of the remaining value and Bob getting 45%."
