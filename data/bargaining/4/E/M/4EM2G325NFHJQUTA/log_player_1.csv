{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, taking into account the potential for future inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 45/55 split. I was hoping for a more even split, considering the initial proposal I made. I'd like to make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that this is a more agreeable compromise for both of us."
