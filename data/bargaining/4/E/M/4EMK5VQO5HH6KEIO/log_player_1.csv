"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can work things out later if you'd like.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer. Let's be reasonable and avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic move.  The inflation means each round is riskier for me, and a 4500 gain is still better than a 20% loss on my previous offer."
