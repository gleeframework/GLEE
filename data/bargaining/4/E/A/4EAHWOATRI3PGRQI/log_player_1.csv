I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor. Since the money is worth less to Bob each round, I want to take most of it now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to try and be more reasonable this time, but I'm still going to aim for a larger share. The inflation hurts Bob more than me, so I think I can still get a good deal."
