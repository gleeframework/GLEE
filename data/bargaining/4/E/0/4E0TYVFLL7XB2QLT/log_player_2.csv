Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2

""bob_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take the offer. We've already lost a lot of value due to inflation, and this is a decent split."
