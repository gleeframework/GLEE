"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to share 90% of the money with you, Bob. It's a fair offer, considering the inflation we need to be aware of. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This time I'm offering you 400,000$, take it or leave it. Time is money, and we both lose with every wasted round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  We're both losing money with every round.  Let's split the money evenly and move on. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Even though it's not the best deal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting a worse offer later due to inflation.
