Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's be practical. This deal gets us both a decent amount and avoids further losses due to inflation. It's a win-win! 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this deal - a slight edge for me, but you're still getting a significant sum before inflation eats away at it any further! 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  While I'd prefer an even split, the potential for further inflation losses makes accepting Alice's offer the more logical choice at this point."
