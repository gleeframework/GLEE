Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. It's my turn now. Let's split it evenly next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's analyze Bob's offer. He's essentially promising an even split in the next round, which seems fair on the surface. However, due to inflation, accepting his offer in the next round means we'd only be getting 450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000.  

It's a risk, but we can do better. We need to incentivize him to accept a deal now."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000

Bob is trying to wear us down! He's sticking to his tactic of promising a seemingly fair deal in the next round.  However, if we wait, that 480,000 will be worth even less: 480,000 * 0.8 = $384,000.  We need to make one last push for a better outcome now."
