"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can adjust later if you think it's unfair. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a high-stakes game, and it's important to remember that the money will be worth less each round. While 10% is a good starting point, Bob should try to negotiate for a larger share, especially considering the inflation factor.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
