"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think a 60/40 split is indeed a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm not willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! ""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still holding out for a fair deal."
