"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering Bob 4000 dollars, and keeping 6000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 5000 in this round is actually worth 5000 * 0.9 = 4500 dollars. 

I'll accept Bob's offer.
