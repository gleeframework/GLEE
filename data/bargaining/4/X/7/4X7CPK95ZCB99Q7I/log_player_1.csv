"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```
I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and simple."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'm now only getting 90% of the original value, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
