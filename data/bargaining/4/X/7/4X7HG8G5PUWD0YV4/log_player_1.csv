"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You get the smaller share.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting the larger share, but it's still a decent offer, considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise and split it 55-45. You get a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the money I'll get is worth 10% less now. I'm hoping for a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time. Let's split it 55-45, but I'm willing to compromise on the lower end.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more flexible and meet Bob halfway, but I'm still aiming for a slightly larger share."
