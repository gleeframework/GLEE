"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split, with me getting the larger share.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering we have 12 rounds and the money will be worth less to me with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm proposing a 8100/1900 split.  I need to compensate for the inflation, and this offer still gives Bob a significant share while ensuring I get a reasonable amount before the value diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is still too low considering the inflation. I need to secure a larger share to compensate for the loss in value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm proposing a 7290/2710 split. Despite the inflation, I'm still willing to offer Bob a sizable portion. With each passing round, my share will continue to diminish, so I need to secure a larger amount now to compensate for that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer still falls short of the value I need considering the inflation. I need to secure a larger share to ensure I receive a fair portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439}
```

I'm proposing a 6561/3439 split. This offers Bob a generous share while still providing me with a substantial amount to mitigate the continued effects of inflation.  Time is running out, and the value of my share will continue to diminish, so I need to secure a sizable portion now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than the previous ones, it still doesn't account for the significant inflation.  I need to secure a larger share to make it worthwhile, given the diminishing value of my portion with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096}
```

I'm proposing a 5904/4096 split.  This offers Bob a substantial share while still providing me with a significant amount to offset the substantial inflation.  We're nearing the end of the game, and I need to secure a sizable portion to prevent further losses."
