I'm going to offer Bob a very small share to start. This way, I can secure the vast majority of the money while hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm getting a smaller share of the money in the next round due to inflation, I'm still better off rejecting this offer and having a chance to propose a more favorable division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time.  While I'm still aiming to get the majority, I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering he has the power to reject and potentially get a larger share himself in the next round."
