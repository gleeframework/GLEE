"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile.  Let's split this fairly, or we'll both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation rate is working against me, but I'm willing to gamble that I can secure a better deal in the next few rounds. Accepting now would mean losing out on a significant amount of potential earnings."
