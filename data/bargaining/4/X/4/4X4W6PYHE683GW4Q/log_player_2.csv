Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a more balanced split, Bob, but I'm not comfortable with 60/40 in your favor. I'm willing to compromise slightly and offer 54/46, which is still a fair and equitable arrangement considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
