"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a good offer, but with inflation looming, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to take a risk and try to flip the offer. While I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I'm hoping the prospect of a bigger share in the next round (and the potential for a larger loss due to inflation) will encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite.  Alice's offer is still better than what I would get if I reject and have to deal with even greater inflation in the next round."
