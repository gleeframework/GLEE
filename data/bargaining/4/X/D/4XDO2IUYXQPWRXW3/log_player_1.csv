"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This is a classic ultimatum game, and the standard strategy is to take nearly everything for yourself, knowing that Bob might reject the offer but will probably accept a small amount rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep negotiating, the inflation risk is too high. Accepting a 50/50 split is a much safer option than risking getting nothing in the next round."
