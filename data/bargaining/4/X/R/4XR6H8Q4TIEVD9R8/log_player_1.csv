Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is 40% of the initial 100 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

After considering the offer, I'll make a decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer, as I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round to make my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
