"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k. What do you say?""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, and I'm giving Bob a decent amount to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'll still make it a decent offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll still consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

In this case, Bob's offer is still a 30% share for me, which is less than my initial offer. I'm not sure if I want to accept a smaller share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the profit. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This offer is a 55% share for me, which is a bit more than my initial offer, but still a decent compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give up too much. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is now worth even less to me than it was in the previous round. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

In this case, Bob's offer is a 35% share for me, which is a slightly better than my previous offer. However, I'm not sure if it's enough of an improvement to accept. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going to stick to my original idea, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This offer is the same as my initial offer, but I'm giving Bob a slightly smaller share. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm also prepared for him to reject it and make another counteroffer."
