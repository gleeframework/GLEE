Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, it's important to consider the impact of inflation.  The value of my gains is now much lower due to the 19% loss, and I have no guarantee that Alice will accept a better offer in the next round. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all."
