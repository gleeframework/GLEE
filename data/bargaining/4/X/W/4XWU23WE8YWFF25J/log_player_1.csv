Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves a decent share for Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to accept it.  After all, he's getting more than nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm getting something, it's significantly less than what I offered Bob in the previous round.  I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer, but still keeping a significant portion of the money.  I need to be more aggressive now, as the inflation will keep eating away at my potential earnings.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before things get worse for him too."
