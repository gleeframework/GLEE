"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}

I'm proposing a 95/5 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less for Bob each round, I'm offering him a small amount to encourage him to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even though Bob's offer is more in line with a fair split, I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself.  The money is still worth the same for me, while it's losing value for Bob each round.  I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Since Bob's offer was rejected, I'm increasing my share, but still leaving him with a decent amount, knowing the money is worth less for him each round.  I hope this will be enough to get a deal done."
