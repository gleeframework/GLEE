"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me a large share of the money, but I'm willing to let Bob have a small portion. I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of inflation and potentially getting less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, and while I don't know the exact impact of inflation on him, I believe he's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the first round, hoping to entice Bob into accepting before the inflation hits him too hard. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to reach a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. While Bob's offer is still lower than what I initially proposed, the inflation is clearly affecting him more than me. If I reject this, the next round could see a much worse offer for me. Accepting guarantees I get at least something, and the inflation won't hit my share as hard as his."
