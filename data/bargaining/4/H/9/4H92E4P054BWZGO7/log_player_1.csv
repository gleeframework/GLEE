"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased, and Bob is offering a smaller share to me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
