"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 7:3""
}

I'm offering Bob $30, which is 30% of the initial $100. I'm keeping $70, which is 70% of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's new offer.

I'll accept this offer:

{
""decision"": ""accept""
}"
