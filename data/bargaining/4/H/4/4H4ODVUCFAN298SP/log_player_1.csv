Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for my liking. I'm feeling generous, so I'll offer you 45. Take it now, it's only going downhill from here, especially for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
