"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** Due to inflation, waiting is costly for Bob. The longer the game goes on, the less his share is worth.  
* **Strong Position:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals he's not desperate and aims for a larger share. 
* **Finality:** By stating this is his final offer, Bob creates urgency. Alice knows if she rejects this, Bob is likely to accept even less favorable terms in future rounds due to inflation.
* **Slight Advantage:** A 55/45 split gives Bob a slight advantage, but it's still a reasonable offer that Alice might accept to avoid further risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is significantly worse, accepting would mean Bob loses almost half the potential gain compared to his initial rejection. It's a gamble, but there's a chance Alice will be more willing to negotiate in the next round to avoid reaching a point where Bob has to accept a tiny sum due to hyperinflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic. This offer benefits us both.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** Inflation is significantly impacting Bob's potential gains. It's crucial to settle quickly.
* **Shift in Power:**  Alice's increasingly aggressive offers suggest she might be overplaying her hand. Rejecting her low offer twice gives Bob some bargaining power back.
* **Compromise:** While not ideal, a 45/55 split is a compromise that limits Bob's losses from inflation while still being more appealing to Alice than risking further rounds where her potential gains decrease.
* **Reasoned Message:** Appealing to reason and mutual benefit might make the offer more palatable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, accept this! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While 3000 is far from ideal, rejecting this offer carries significant risk:

* **Severe Inflation:** In the next round, the money will be worth 40.95% less for Bob. This means even if he managed to secure a 50/50 split in a later round, he'd gain less than accepting the current offer.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is clearly pushing for a larger share and knows time is on her side. It's unlikely she'll offer a significantly better deal in future rounds.

Accepting the current offer cuts losses and avoids the risk of getting even less in a future round due to the accelerating inflation."
