Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle this fairly.  A 50/50 split is the most logical outcome now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. The 50/50 split seems fair, especially considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us. Continuing to negotiate further might lead to additional losses due to inflation, so accepting this offer seems like the most logical choice."
