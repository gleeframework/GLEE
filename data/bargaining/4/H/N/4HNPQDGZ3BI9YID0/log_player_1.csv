I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself.  It's a pretty generous offer for the first round.  Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's not ideal, but I'd rather take $5,000 now than risk getting nothing at all.  With the inflation, my share will only get smaller in the next round."
