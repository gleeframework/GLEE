I'll start by being generous, but not too generous. This way, I get a large share while still potentially leaving room for Bob to negotiate if he's unhappy with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  While I'm losing money with each round, I'm still in a stronger position to negotiate since I have the ability to make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly. This is to try and incentivize Bob to accept while still giving me a significant share. With each round, the value of the money decreases, so I need to ensure I get a good deal before it's too late."
