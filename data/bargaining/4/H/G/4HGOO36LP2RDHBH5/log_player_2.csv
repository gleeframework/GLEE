"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. While it might seem like a decent chunk of money, the inflation rate makes it important to aim for a larger share, especially in the early rounds.
* **Bob's counter-offer:**  
    * This offer is still generous to Alice, giving her slightly more than half.
    * However, it secures a significantly larger amount for Bob compared to Alice's initial offer. 
    * The message aims to frame the offer as a win-win, encouraging Alice to accept rather than risk further inflation.

By being firm but fair, Bob increases his chances of securing a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's end this, I'm being reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** The inflation is steadily eating away at the value of the money. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, further rounds carry the risk of even less favorable outcomes.
* **Alice's offer improvement:**  Although marginally, Alice has increased Bob's potential gain from her initial offer. This suggests a willingness to compromise, even if slight.
* **""Reasonable"" framing:** Alice is trying to position her offer as the sensible choice to avoid further losses due to inflation. While potentially manipulative, it does highlight the shared risk.

While Bob could push for more in a potential Round 4, the risk of walking away with even less due to inflation makes accepting this offer a safer, if not perfect, outcome."
