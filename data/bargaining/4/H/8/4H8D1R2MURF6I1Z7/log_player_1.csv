Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty lopsided offer, but I figure it's best to try to get as much as possible early on before inflation kicks in.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm losing 10% of the value of my money, a 50/50 split is a much better deal than what I was initially offered. It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further inflation and getting nothing at all."
