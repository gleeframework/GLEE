Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to get a better deal. Given the 20% inflation, I'll offer a smaller amount to Alice to account for the decreasing value of money.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger toll, I'll try to get a better deal. Since Alice is offering a slightly smaller amount to me, I'll try to get an even better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the increasing inflation and the fact that Alice's offer was 55/45, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Alice to account for the decreasing value of my share.
