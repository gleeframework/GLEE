"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This is a fair starting point, given that we both have different inflation rates.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my original offer.  While I understand inflation is impacting both of us, this offer doesn't reflect the fact that his money is losing value at twice the rate mine is.  I'll reject this and see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 and keeping 700,000 for myself. This offer reflects the inflation rates, giving him a larger share than before but still keeping a majority for me.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While this is a less favorable offer than my previous proposals, it seems like Bob isn't budging.  At this point, inflation is hitting him harder, and accepting this offer gives me at least a decent amount, even if it's less than I wanted initially.  Let's end the game."
