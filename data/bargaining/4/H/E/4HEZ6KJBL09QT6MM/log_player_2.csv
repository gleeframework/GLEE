"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a good start. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $1000, it's a very small portion of the total money. Rejecting allows me to make the proposal in the next round, where I can potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be more equitable this time. This way we both get a good share, and we can move on.""}
