"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you take 20. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. A 50/50 split is the most equitable.  Accept and we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. The 50 I'd gain is actually worth 40% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation factor. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to get a larger share of the money, but not so large that Bob will reject it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 60 is a fair amount considering the inflation. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but 60/40 is a good compromise considering the inflation. Accept and we can both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation factor, the 40 I'd gain in this offer is actually worth significantly less than the 60 I initially proposed in Round 3. However, since the inflation factor is now 48.8% less, I'll have to re-evaluate the offer.

The 40 I'd gain in this offer is actually worth about 51.2% of the original amount, which is more than the 40% I'd gain in the original 50/50 split.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor continuing to decrease my potential gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

However, I'll also try to be more realistic about what I can get, considering the inflation factor.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk and propose a 70/30 split. It's not ideal, but I think it's the best I can get at this point.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still willing to be reasonable. 70/30 is a good compromise. Accept and let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation factor, the 30 I'd gain in this offer is actually worth a very small amount compared to the original $100. I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation!

However, I also realize that if I reject this offer, the next round will be even more challenging, and the inflation factor will make my potential gains even smaller.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer, which is not ideal, or risk waiting for a better deal that might not come.
