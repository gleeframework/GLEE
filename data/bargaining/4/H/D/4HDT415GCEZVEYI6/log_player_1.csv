Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%.  I figure this is a good starting point, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer.  Bob is being way too greedy. Even with inflation, 200,000 is a lot less than the 900,000 I was initially aiming for. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a 40/60 split.  I know that the inflation is impacting my gains, but I'm still confident that I can get a decent amount of money. This offer is a compromise, and I hope Bob will see it as fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While I'm getting less than I initially hoped for, the inflation is starting to seriously impact my gains.  Accepting this offer will secure me 400,000, which is a significant amount even after the inflation.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the next round, so I'm going to take what I can get."
