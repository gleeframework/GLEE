"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to make a counteroffer.

I'll analyze the offer:

* Alice gain: 300,000 (worth 300,000 in the first round, same as before)
* Bob gain: 700,000 (worth 735,000 in the first round, 5% less than the initial 777,777.78)

I'm not sure if I want to give up 300,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in favor of Bob, and I rejected it, I'll try to shift the balance back in my favor. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Bob!""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is closer to the original 60-40 split, but with a slightly higher share for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer:

* Alice gain: 450,000 (worth 450,000 in the first round, same as before)
* Bob gain: 550,000 (worth 592,857.14 in the first round, 14.26% less than the initial 693,877.58)

I was hoping for a better deal, but Bob's offer is a bit closer to what I was asking for in the previous round. I'll accept this offer.
