"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the value of the money I'll get if I accept this offer.

In this case, I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60% of the remaining amount, I'll try to adjust my offer to be more favorable to myself. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the money, and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! 

Let me think... Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to consider the value of the money I'll get if I accept this offer.

I'll calculate the value of my gain in the first round, which is 800,000. Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, I'll assume his gain is worth around 51.2% of its original value. This means his gain in this round is approximately 51.2% of 700,000, which is around 358,400.

In this case, I'll reject the offer because my gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I think I can do better than 300,000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the fact that the money is worth less and less with each passing round.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money, and Bob gets 30%."
