Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's getting the better end of the deal, doesn't he?

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal for myself.
