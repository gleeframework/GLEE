"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money I gain in the first round ($60) to be equivalent to $60 now.

Bob's offer is for a 50-50 split, which is a more favorable split for me compared to the previous round. I'll accept this offer.
