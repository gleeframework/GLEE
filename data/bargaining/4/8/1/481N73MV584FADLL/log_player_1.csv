"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. I'm being generous, but I'm also trying to get the better deal. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, and Bob's offer is 300,000, that's equivalent to 95% of the original 318,182.50 (calculated as 300,000 / 0.95).

Similarly, Bob's gain of 700,000 is equivalent to 80% of the original 875,000 (calculated as 700,000 / 0.8).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take control, Bob! 60-40 is the new norm!""
}
```

This way, I'm aiming to get 60% of the money, which is a more significant share than before. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! Let's try a more equal split! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on the money's value.

To calculate the equivalent values in the first round, I'll adjust the amounts:

My gain of 450,000 is equivalent to 85.71% of the original 526,315.79 (calculated as 450,000 / 0.8527).

Bob's gain of 550,000 is equivalent to 62.5% of the original 875,000 (calculated as 550,000 / 0.625).

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable than the previous ones. I'll accept this offer.
