"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with a fair split, I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the values are now:

* My gain: 6000 (pre-inflation: 8000) x 0.9 = 5400, but I'll accept the 6000 as it's more than I would get
* Bob's gain: 4000 (pre-inflation: 2000) x 0.8 = 3200, but he's offering 4000

I'll accept this offer since it's a better deal for me than the previous one, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.
