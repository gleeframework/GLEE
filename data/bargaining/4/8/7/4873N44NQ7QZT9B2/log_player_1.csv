"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better, let's split it 60-40 this time. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal!

However, I'm not going to fall for it. My gain is worth 5% less, but I'm still getting 40, which is not a bad deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""My offer: 55-45, a compromise for a smooth split!""
}
```"
