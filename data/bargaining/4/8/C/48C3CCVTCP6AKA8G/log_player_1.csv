"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60-40 split.  Let's go for 70-30.  Fair is fair, but I'm feeling lucky! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I don't think I can accept this offer. With a 70-30 split, I'd be getting only 30% of the remaining 10,000 dollars, which is even less than my initial 40%. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decreasing value of the money.
