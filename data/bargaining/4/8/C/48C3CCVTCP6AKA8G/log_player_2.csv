I'm Bob, and I'm feeling a little greedy.  I'll see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than a 60-40 split.  Let's go for 70-30.  Fair is fair, but I'm feeling lucky!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more. 45-55 is a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm taking this offer!  With the inflation hitting harder for Alice, this is a good deal for me. Let's call it a day."
