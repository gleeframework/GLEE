"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping to get Bob to accept quickly.  The slight risk is that he might be greedy and want to see if he can get more in a later round. But, I'm banking on him being more risk-averse and wanting to secure something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get more, the risk of getting nothing at all is too high.  With inflation, each round makes the potential gains smaller, so it's best to secure something now rather than risk ending up with zero."
