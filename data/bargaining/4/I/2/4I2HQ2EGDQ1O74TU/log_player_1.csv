I propose taking almost all the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar. I figure this is a good starting point to see how much he's willing to fight for."

{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm still aiming for the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share this time to see if it's enough to convince him."

I'm sticking to my strategy. It's clear Bob is willing to hold out for a large share, and I'm not willing to settle for a tiny amount."

Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 999900, ""bob_gain"": 100}

I'm increasing my offer to Bob significantly, but still holding onto the lion's share. I believe this is a good compromise that might make Bob more amenable to settling."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, hoping to find a point where he's willing to accept. I'm still aiming for the majority, but I'm becoming more realistic about what Bob might be willing to settle for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm significantly increasing my offer to Bob, but I still believe that a 9:1 split in my favor is fair given my consistent efforts to negotiate.  The game is getting close to the end, and I think this offer will encourage Bob to settle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not willing to settle for a 1:9 split in Bob's favor. I'm confident that we can still reach a more equitable agreement. There's a chance for both of us to get a decent share of the money if we keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm realizing that Bob is likely to accept a 50/50 split. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than getting nothing at all. I'm hoping this offer will finally be accepted and end the game."
