"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game underway and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Since my gain is worth 20% less than in Round 1, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer for Round 4.

Since my gain is worth 48.8% less than in Round 1, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. However, I still think 45 is a bit too low for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll make a new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I need to prioritize my own gain""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

Considering the significantly reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer for Round 6.

Since my gain is worth 67.23% less than in Round 1, I'll have to be very cautious. However, 42 is a relatively decent offer considering the circumstances.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm hoping to get something out of this deal, even if it's not ideal."
