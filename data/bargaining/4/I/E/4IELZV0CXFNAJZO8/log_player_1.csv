"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 5% less, so it's effectively $38. Not a bad deal, but I'd like to try to get a better share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, my offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm trying to split the remaining $100 as evenly as possible, considering the inflation."
