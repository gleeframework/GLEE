"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering I am the one making the first proposal. I am also warning him that if he rejects, the money will be worth less for me in the next round, which might make me less willing to offer him a good deal. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut is a bit high, Alice. I'm proposing a more balanced split. How about 45/55? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am not happy with the 45/55 split proposed by Bob. Considering the money is worth 5% less for me now, I think I deserve a better offer. I am willing to take a risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 57/43?""}\n\nI am taking into account the inflation and the fact that the money is worth 5% less for me now. I am offering Bob a slightly better deal than before, but still trying to get a good share for myself. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a my final offer. It's important to wrap this up quickly with inflation eating into your share, Alice.  47/53 seems fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","I am not happy with the 47/53 split proposed by Bob. Considering the money is worth 14.26% less for me now, I think I deserve a better offer. However, Bob's message mentions that this is his final offer, which makes me think that he might not be willing to negotiate further. I am also concerned about the inflation eating into my share, and I don't want to risk losing even more value. I am willing to accept this offer and end the game, rather than taking a risk and possibly getting a worse deal or no deal at all.
