"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is 4750. Bob's gain of 5000 is worth 100% of its original value. Since I'm getting less than I initially proposed, I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in this offer. Initially, I would have gained 6000. After 3 rounds of inflation, the value of my gain is 6000 * (0.95)^3 = 4756.25. In this round, the value of my gain is 14.26% less than that, which is 4756.25 * 0.8594 = 4094.45.

Since I'm getting less than I initially proposed, and Bob is getting more than he proposed in round 2, I'll accept this offer.
