Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground.  We're both losing money, so let's try to agree on something fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is working against him more than me. His share of the money is losing value faster. I'll hold out for a slightly better offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it evenly. We both lose a lot of money with each round. It's the most reasonable solution. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is finally offering a 50/50 split. While I could gamble that he'd offer me more in later rounds, the inflation is eating away at the value quickly. Accepting this offer guarantees a fair share for both of us before the money loses too much value."
