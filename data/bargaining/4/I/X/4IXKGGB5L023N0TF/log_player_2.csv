"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's compromise, this way we both get a good amount, considering the inflation.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting me harder, Bob. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems slightly more reasonable, I still think I can get a better deal, especially since the inflation is affecting Alice more than me. I'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. You're losing more value each round, so it's better to accept this and minimize your losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. Take it or leave it - any more rounds will only hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable offer at this point. Further rounds will only lead to more losses for both of us, so it's best to accept this offer and end the game."
