Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round. Let's just split it evenly and avoid further losses. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is right, we're both losing money. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting even less later, or nothing at all if we run out of rounds!
