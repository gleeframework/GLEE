"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share this time.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\n\nI have received Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round due to inflation, I need to consider this in my decision. Given that Bob's offer is the opposite of what I initially proposed, with him getting the larger share, and considering the impact of inflation, I decide to reject this offer in hopes of getting a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### AI: Round 3\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my initial offer and then made a counteroffer with him getting the larger share, I need to adjust my strategy. This time, I'll propose a slightly different split, still aiming for a bit more than half but acknowledging the decreasing value of the money for me.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob."
