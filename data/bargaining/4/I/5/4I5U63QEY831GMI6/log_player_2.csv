Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous split for me.  I'm willing to give you a thousand dollars, Bob.  What do you say?

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too lopsided. Let's be reasonable. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. Let's compromise with a 55/45 split in my favor. This takes into account inflation and still offers you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
