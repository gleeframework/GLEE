"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
I'm proposing a 80/20 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the numbers are:

* Alice gain: 50
* Bob gain: 50

I think this is a fair split, and it's a good opportunity to end the game. I'll accept this offer.
