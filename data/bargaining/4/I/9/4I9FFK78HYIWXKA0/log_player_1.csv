"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. No need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward division of the $1,000,000. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% now, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you want more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 400000 x 0.95 = 380000
Bob gain: 600000 x 0.95 = 570000

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, as I'd like to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting 60/40, Bob. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```

It's now Bob's turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 420,000, but I'm still leaving a decent amount for Bob. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70% now, but I'm getting a bit impatient, so this is my last offer for now. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 300000 x 0.8574 = 257142.00
Bob gain: 700000 x 0.8574 = 600350.00

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, as I'd like to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting 70/30, Bob. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```

It's now Bob's turn again, but I'm curious to see if he'll make a better offer or stick to his last one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 450,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this one, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'll give you 80% this round. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 22.62% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 200000 x 0.7778 = 155556.00
Bob gain: 800000 x 0.7778 = 622400.00

I'm not willing to accept an 80/20 split, as I'd like to get a better deal. However, I'm starting to think that Bob is serious about walking away, and I might not get a better offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting 80/20, Bob. But I'm willing to accept a slightly lower share if you're willing to meet me halfway.""
}
```

I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure if he'll accept my condition."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, Bob. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something closer to 50/50.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 320,000, which is closer to 50/50. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
