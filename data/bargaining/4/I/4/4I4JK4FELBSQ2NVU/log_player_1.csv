"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. This seems like a fair starting point considering that we have 12 rounds and the value of the money decreases for Bob.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. While I would have liked to get more, this is a fair split considering the inflation factor and the fact that we have 11 rounds left.  It's better to take a good offer now than risk getting nothing at the end."
