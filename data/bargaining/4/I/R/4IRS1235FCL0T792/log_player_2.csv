"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take this small share, Bob. It's a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While Alice loses value quickly, I can afford to be patient and aim for a much larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer ensures you get a decent share while acknowledging the impact of inflation on your gains.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than last time. We both need to adapt to the inflation, but let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is getting more reasonable, and the inflation is starting to hurt. Taking 60% now is better than risking getting even less in future rounds."
