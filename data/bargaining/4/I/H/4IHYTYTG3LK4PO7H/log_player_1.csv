"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Let's see if you'll accept it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll get 60% of the current value of the money, which is 80% of the original 80% of $10,000, so that's 0.8 * 0.8 * 10,000 = 6,400.

Bob gets 40% of the current value of the money, which is 80% of the original 20% of $10,000, so that's 0.8 * 0.2 * 10,000 = 1,600.

I'll accept Bob's offer for the sake of moving forward:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
