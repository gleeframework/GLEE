"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair split, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of getting less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
The money is worth 5% less now, and Bob's offer is a fair 50/50 split.  I'd rather get 500,000 now than risk getting less in the next round."
