"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% this time, but we can adjust it for the next round if you want. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual values are:

Alice gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000
Bob gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's a 75-25 split in Bob's favor. I'd rather not accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offers, I think I'll try to negotiate a better split. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (0.8^2), I'll aim for a more even split.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. I hope Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
