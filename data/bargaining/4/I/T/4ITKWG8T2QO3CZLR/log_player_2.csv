"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob.  This gives me a good share while still leaving you with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 30/70 split right off the bat. There's a lot of game left, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split this more fairly, Alice.  This gives us both a good amount, and it avoids any unnecessary risk of losing money in later rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money - literally! Let's settle this now. This is a good deal before inflation eats away at your potential earnings. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, it's becoming clear that Alice is willing to take a bigger share.  Since the money is losing value with each round, it's best to take this offer and end the game."
