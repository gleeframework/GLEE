"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a little more for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. On one hand, I'm getting more than I initially proposed, but on the other hand, I'm still losing 30%. I'll have to think about it.

For now, I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I'm not going to give up too much""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting even less than I initially thought.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not thrilled about giving up 25% of the remaining 100$, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
