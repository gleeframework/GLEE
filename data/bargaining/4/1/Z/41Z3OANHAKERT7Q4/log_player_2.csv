Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see your point. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about 45/55?  I'm trying to be fair, but inflation is hitting me harder than you.  Let's settle this before the money loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of 55/45 in round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Alice is experiencing inflation at a much faster rate (20% per round) than Bob (5% per round). This means her potential gains are diminishing rapidly, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal in later rounds.
* **Future Uncertainty:** Rejecting this offer means Bob has to propose a deal in Round 4. There's no guarantee Alice will find his offer acceptable, leading to further rounds and further devaluation of the money.
* **Current Gains:** Accepting 55/45 still gives Bob a larger share of the money. While he could potentially get more in later rounds, the risk of those rounds occurring and the decreasing value of the money makes this a less attractive gamble."
