"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'm not as eager to accept this offer as I was in the first round. I'll reject this proposal and try to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more favorable offer this time. Considering the inflation is only affecting Bob's gain, I'll try to get a larger share for myself. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger toll on Bob's gain, but he's still trying to get a 55-45 split. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's not significantly better than my previous offer. However, I'll consider it carefully.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to take advantage of the increasing inflation and make a more aggressive offer. Since Bob's gain is worth less and less with each round, I'll aim for a larger share for myself. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain now. I'm starting to think that I should accept this offer, as it's unlikely that Bob will be able to offer me a better deal in future rounds. Plus, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal than a 58-42 split.
