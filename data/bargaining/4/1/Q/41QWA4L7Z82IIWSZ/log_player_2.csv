Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a significant share.  I'm proposing a compromise - slightly better for me than your offer, but closer to a true split.  Let's end this before inflation eats away more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 495000 
# Alice gain: 505000
