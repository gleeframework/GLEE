,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I think 40 is a reasonable amount considering the inflation",Bob,2,
36.0,54.0,"Considering the inflation, I adjust my offer to 36 for myself and 64 for Bob. This maintains fairness while accounting for the diminishing value of money in each round.",Alice,2,accept
