"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

I accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a 40-60 split, which is even more in Bob's favor than my initial offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and having the money be worth even less due to inflation."
