"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this started, Bob! I'm willing to give you a generous 20% of the total, but I'm hoping to get the majority. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept a measly 20%.  I want a bigger share! Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. I'll take 60% and leave you with 40%. But don't expect this kind of offer again!  Think carefully about this one.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to give you a decent share, Bob. But I think I deserve a bit more now that you've seen my generosity in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is better than what I'd get if I keep rejecting.  I'm taking the $4000 and moving on."
