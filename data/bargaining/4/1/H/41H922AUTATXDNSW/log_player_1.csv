"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, Bob! I'm willing to give you a generous 20% of the total, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. I'll take 60% and leave you with 40%. But don't expect this kind of offer again!  Think carefully about this one. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the offer, I'd rather not accept this deal. I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round, but I'd like to keep some room for negotiation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to give you a decent share, Bob. But I think I deserve a bit more now that you've seen my generosity in the first round.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the remaining $8,000 (due to inflation), which is $4,800, but I'm actually offering $6,000."
