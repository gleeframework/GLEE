Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

This is a tough one, but with time pressure and inflation eating away at the value, accepting is the safer choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're already past the halfway point, and the risk of getting nothing increases with each round. 
* **Inflation:** The longer this drags on, the less that $450,000 will be worth.
* **Uncertain Future Offers:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better, and she might even offer less in future rounds. 

While Bob could hold out for more, the risk of walking away with nothing after Round 12 is too high."
