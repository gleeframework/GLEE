"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer, as I believe that Bob will accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer, and I'm happy to accept it. There is no guarantee that I will get a better deal in the next round, and with inflation, the money will be worth less."
