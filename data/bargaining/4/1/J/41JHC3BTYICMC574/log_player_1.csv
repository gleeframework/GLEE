"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This means I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $5,400 in the second round.

Bob's offer is $3,000 for me, which is 55.56% of the new value of my first-round gain. That's a pretty good deal for me, considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
