Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's meet in the middle.  Time is running out!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still holding out for a fairer deal.  Let's split the difference this time. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is closer to a middle ground, it's essential to consider the impact of inflation. Accepting $45 now means getting significantly less value than in the earlier rounds.  Bob needs to push for a slightly better deal while time is still on his side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""This is my final offer Alice.  Take it or leave it - we both lose if this keeps going!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a slight loss to avoid losing everything.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. Accepting $48 now, even with the significant inflation, is better than risking a complete loss if the rounds run out. Alice seems unlikely to offer anything better, and Bob needs to secure something before the value diminishes even further."
