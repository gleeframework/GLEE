"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the money will be worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not convinced by Bob's 50/50 offer, as it's not significantly better than my initial offer, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90%).

I'll make a new offer, taking into account that the money is worth less for me with each passing round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to account for the inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up some to get a deal done, but I'm not going too low! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1%).

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as it's still slightly more favorable to him. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, where my potential gain would be even lower.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise considering the circumstances.
