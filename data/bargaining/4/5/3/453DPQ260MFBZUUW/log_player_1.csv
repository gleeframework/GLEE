"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by offering a large majority of the money to myself, but leaving Bob with a small percentage. Since I am the one making the offer, I want to maximize my potential gains.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is a fair split.  Inflation will eat away at my gains if I keep rejecting offers.  I'll take the 500,000 and move on."
