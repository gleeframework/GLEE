I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept. I'm taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to me in later rounds. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I initially wanted, it's still a decent amount, and the inflation would make any further rounds much riskier for me."
