"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split, favoring myself slightly as I'm less affected by inflation in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}
```

I propose a 54/46 split, favoring myself slightly again, recognizing the inflation but aiming for a more balanced distribution than Bob's previous proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm getting less than my initial offer, Bob's offer is significantly more favorable to me after this round's inflation. It's best to accept and secure this gain."
