Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for Bob with each round. Accepting $43 now is better than risking even less in subsequent rounds.
* **Alice's pattern:** Alice is consistently aiming for a larger share but has made concessions. It's unlikely she'll drastically change her position in future offers.
* **Time value:**  Prolonging the game only hurts Bob due to inflation. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than a potentially worse outcome later."
