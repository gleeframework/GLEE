"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the smaller share this round to leave room for future negotiations. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm leaving room for potential future negotiations to adjust the ratio."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I'll get 630,000 in this round. Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he'll get 240,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split, but it's a good opportunity to end the game and get some money. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal considering the inflation.

I'll decide to reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I'll get 561,000 in this round.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than the previous one, but I'm still leaving room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'm not quite there yet. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'll get 367,800 in this round. Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, so he'll get 520,200.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a 40-60 split, which is even more in Bob's favor than the previous round. However, I'm running out of time, and I don't know if I can do better.

I'll decide to reject the offer for now.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

This offer is a bit more aggressive than the previous one, but I'm still trying to find a compromise."
