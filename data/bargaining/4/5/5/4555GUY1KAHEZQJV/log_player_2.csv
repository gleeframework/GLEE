"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  I know the money will be worth less each round, so I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see if Alice will budge."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's make a deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation risk 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I think accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Inflation has already reduced my potential gains significantly, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer me more in the next round.  It's better to take what I can get at this point."
