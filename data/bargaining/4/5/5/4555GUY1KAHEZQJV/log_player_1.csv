"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 40% difference in our gains, especially considering that my money is still worth the same as in the first round. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation risk""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a relatively balanced split."
