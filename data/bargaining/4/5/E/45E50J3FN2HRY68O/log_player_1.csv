I'm starting with a strong offer, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1000,  remember inflation has devalued my potential gains. I'm not giving up so easily. Let's see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit, but still keeping the majority.  I'm hoping Bob realizes that continuing to reject offers will only hurt him in the long run, especially with the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting. Bob's offer is getting worse for me with each round, but I know he's also experiencing inflation.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but I'm still aiming for a majority.  Inflation is making the money less valuable each round, so I need to strike a balance between getting a fair share and avoiding a situation where we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting.  Although inflation is hurting me significantly, I believe I can hold out for a better deal.  Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unfavorable, and I'm hoping he'll realize the need to compromise soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but this time I'm aiming for a more balanced split.  We're getting close to the end of the game, and the risk of both of us getting nothing is becoming increasingly real.  I think this is a fair offer that reflects the inflation we've both experienced."
