"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting too low, let's see if you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 90% of the original amount, which is $3600. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to do better this time. Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 81% of the original amount ($8100), so I'll aim for a higher share.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! My gain of 4500 is now worth 72.9% of the original amount, which is $7290. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better, and this offer is not too bad. I'll accept this offer.
