"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I propose to take 990,000$ and let Bob have 10,000$.  Since I'm the first to propose, I'm aiming for a large share but leaving a small amount for Bob to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept the offer. While I'm losing 10% of the value of my gain due to inflation, getting 500,000$ is still a good outcome. It's better than risking getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
