"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can take a smaller share, but it's still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $5000 gain in the first round is now worth $4750 in the second round, so the value of the money is decreasing.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $3000, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
