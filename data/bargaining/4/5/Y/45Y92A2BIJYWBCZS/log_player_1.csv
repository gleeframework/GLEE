"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a fair share considering we're starting with 100 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With the new values, I'll gain 40 dollars, which is 40% of the remaining 80 dollars (100 - 20% = 80). This seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less, I'll make a new proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is a slightly more aggressive proposal this time. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
