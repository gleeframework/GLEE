"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still holding out for more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to negotiate, eh?

I'm not sure I'm willing to give up that much more, but I'm willing to make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much. I'll make a counteroffer: 550000 for me, 450000 for you.""
}
