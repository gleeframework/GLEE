"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it was a fair split last round, but now it's not fair? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to call me out on my previous statement.

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 50-50 split is fair, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'd like to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the decreasing value of money.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, taking into account the ongoing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still trying to take advantage of the inflation, aren't you? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is accusing me of trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing at an increasing rate. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the accelerating inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I need to ensure I'm not left with too little in the end.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 52-48 in my favor, taking into account the accelerating inflation and trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting to get desperate, aren't you? This is getting old. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to psych me out. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not getting desperate, but I'm getting concerned about the value of the money decreasing rapidly. I'll make a new offer that tries to account for the accelerating inflation and Bob's increasing demands."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and split the remaining money evenly, but I'm not going to give in to your increasing demands.""
}
```

I'm going back to a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will finally accept and we can end this game."
