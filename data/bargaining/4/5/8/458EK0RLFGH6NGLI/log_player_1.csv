"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair 50/50 split, but I'll take a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4500 in the first round's value.

Considering the offer, I think a 50-50 split is fair, but I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more since I'm getting a smaller share in terms of real value. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting a worse deal in the next round.
