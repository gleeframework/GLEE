"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  This round ensures you get a significant sum. Remember, the pot shrinks for me with every round, making cooperation beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
