"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. You get one dollar, I get the rest.  You know you can't do better in the next round! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While it's true my negotiating power decreases each round, Alice is vastly undervaluing my potential gains in future rounds.  I'm willing to gamble that she'll be more reasonable in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  This round ensures you get a significant sum. Remember, the pot shrinks for me with every round, making cooperation beneficial for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm tired of this back-and-forth. Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest way, and it ensures we both get a decent amount.  We're both losing money with every round, so let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right, the longer this goes on, the less I stand to gain. A 50/50 split is a fair deal at this point."
