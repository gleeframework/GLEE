"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Accept and we can split the $100 easily.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
