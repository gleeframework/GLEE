This offer gives me a significant advantage, but leaves Bob with something. Hopefully, it's enough to convince him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation will continue to eat away at my potential gains. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and accepting ensures I get something."
