"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small portion, and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While 1000$ is something, it's worth taking a chance to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'll likely lose some money to inflation, but it's a risk worth taking."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, Alice.  Let's end this game and both walk away with a good share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's my turn again. Let's try a more even split this time, before inflation hits even harder. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get a decent amount and avoids further inflation losses."
