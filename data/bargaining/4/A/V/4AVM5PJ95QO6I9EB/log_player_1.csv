"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% of the total. Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. How about we compromise and I take 40%? It's still a decent split, and we can end this soon. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $5400.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving up 40% of the total, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob, but I'd like to see if we can do better. I'm not comfortable with 40% going to you. Let's keep negotiating!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of its original value (90% * 90% = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8100,
  ""bob_gain"": 1900,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risks and efforts. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50/50. It's a fair deal, and we can finally end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $8100 in round 3 is now worth 72.9% of its original value (1 - 0.271 = 0.729).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 50% of the total, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I think we've both been reasonable. Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day. I'm tired of negotiating!""
}
```"
