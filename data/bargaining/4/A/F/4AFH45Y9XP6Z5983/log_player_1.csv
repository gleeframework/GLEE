"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the original $100. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering your last offer. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken its toll! My gain is worth 5% less now, so I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than 40% of the current value of the money.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a bit more than my previous offer, considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation."
