"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 990,000/10,000 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as it leaves a small portion for Bob while ensuring the majority for me. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get at least something.  With each round, the value of the money decreases, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
