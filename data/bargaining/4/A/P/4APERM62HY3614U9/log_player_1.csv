{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. This is a good starting point, and we can reassess as we go along."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm not as motivated to accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
