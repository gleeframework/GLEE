"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split the money 40-60. It's a fair start, and we can reassess in the next round if needed. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
