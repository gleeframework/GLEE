"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take the majority of the money, but I'll give you a small share to keep you interested.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 10%. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a fair offer. Let's see if you'll accept a 4:1 split. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is indeed a fair one, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 4:1 split, and we can divide the $10,000 accordingly."
