"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the advantage I have with the faster devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your starting offer was a bit too skewed for my liking. Let's find a middle ground.  This offer is much fairer considering the devaluation we both face.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we have different ideas of 'fair'.  This is a slight improvement on my previous offer to account for the devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is barely budging, and her ""improvements"" are not keeping up with the devaluation, especially hers. We need to push for a more significant shift in our favor before we run out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6200,
""alice_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the clock is ticking much faster for you. This offer considers both our positions and the rapid devaluation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  Every round costs us both money. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of the devaluation. While not ideal, a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome at this stage. Accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we continue to haggle."
