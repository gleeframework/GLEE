**Reasoning:**

While I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, it's important to consider the following:

* **Continuing the game:**  If I reject this offer, the next round will see the value of the money I receive decrease even further. It's unlikely Bob will offer me a better deal in the future.
* **Time value of money:** Even though the money is worth less, having it now is better than risking getting even less in the future. 
* **Risk vs. reward:**  There's a high risk of getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers. This offer, while not ideal, provides some guaranteed gain. 

Therefore, it's more advantageous to accept Bob's offer."
