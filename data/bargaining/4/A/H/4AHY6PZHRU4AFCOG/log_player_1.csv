I'm going to start by offering Bob a smaller share. I'm hoping he'll accept, but if he doesn't, I'll have a chance to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is working against me, and accepting Bob's offer guarantees me something. The value of my share is reduced, but it's still better than risking getting nothing in a later round."
