"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take a slight advantage, as you rejected my initial offer.  Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give Bob a 60/40 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving you a 60/40 split. It's not fair!""
}
```

I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not 60/40. How about 58/42?""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still trying to get a decent share for myself."
