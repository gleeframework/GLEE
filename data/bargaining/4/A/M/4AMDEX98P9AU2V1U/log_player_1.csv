"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer, taking into account that the money is worth 40% less now due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

I'm offering a 40-60 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
