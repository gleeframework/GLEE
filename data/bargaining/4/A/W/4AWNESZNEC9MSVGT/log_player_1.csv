Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but I need to hold firm. While he's feeling the pressure of inflation, accepting this offer would still give me significantly less than my starting point in Round 1. I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  This is the final round I'm offering an even split. You'll lose even more if we don't agree now!"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** This is a crucial round. Bob knows if he rejects this, the next offer will likely be heavily in my favor as it's the final round. 
* **Inflation Impact:**  His share has diminished significantly due to inflation. I'm highlighting this to make him realize the cost of continued refusal.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  By offering a 50/50 split, I'm coming across as fair.  This might be the push he needs to accept, knowing the alternative is likely far worse for him."
