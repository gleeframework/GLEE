"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more even split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go for a 50/50 split. It's the fairest and simplest way to divide the money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince Alice is now offering a 50/50 split and considering the effect of inflation, which reduces the value of the money with each passing round, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable decision to ensure a fair share without risking further devaluation of the money."
