"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, since you rejected my initial offer. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think it's fair to flip the script just because I rejected the initial offer. I was hoping for a more collaborative approach.

I'll reject Bob's offer and propose a new one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more reasonable offer. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. I'll give you 45% and take 55%. It's a fair compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $5,500 and Bob $4,500. I hope this one is more acceptable to Bob!"
