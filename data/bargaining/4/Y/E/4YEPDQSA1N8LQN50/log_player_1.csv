"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, so we both get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $40 is a decent offer. However, I still feel like I deserve more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a slightly better deal for me than his previous offer of $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 48, but I think I'm getting a better deal 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $48 is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. I'll try to get an even better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bigger share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a slightly better deal for me than his previous offer of $45, and I'm hoping he'll accept it this time."
