"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
