"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm confident Bob will see the value in getting anything at all, especially considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I'm aware of the inflation, this offer is too unfair. I'm willing to negotiate, but this is too far off."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split this time.  I'm willing to compromise, but I believe my contribution to the negotiation is worth more than a 5/95 split."
