I propose a 9000/1000 split, with me taking the larger share.  This is a fair initial offer considering the money will be worth less to Bob in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
``` 

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm offering a bit less to Bob this time. Since I'm the one making the offer, I need to make it more appealing than the 50/50 split he offered, while also keeping a good chunk of the money for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Bob is getting greedy! He's taking advantage of the inflation and offering me less and less each round. I'm not going to accept this offer - I'll be the one to make the next offer and I can get more for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm trying to strike a balance. I need to offer Bob more than his previous offer, but still get the majority of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept this, as his share keeps decreasing with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting even more greedy, taking more than 60% of the money! I'm not going to accept this offer. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm willing to drop my share a little more, but I still need to secure a majority of the money.  We're running out of rounds, and I'm hoping Bob sees the value in getting 4000 now, instead of risking getting nothing if we run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is getting more and more unreasonable!  I'm not going to accept this offer. I know I can still get a better deal for myself.  We're running out of time, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm going for a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer considering Bob's share has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'm hoping he'll realize that getting half is better than risking getting nothing."
