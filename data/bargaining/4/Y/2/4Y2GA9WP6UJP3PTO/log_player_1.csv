Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, considering the inflation affecting both of us.  This should be a fair deal given the changing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
