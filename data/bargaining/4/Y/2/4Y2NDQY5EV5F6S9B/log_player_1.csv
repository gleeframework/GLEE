"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to see if Bob is willing to accept a quick deal.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, and the inflation is only going to make things worse for him if we keep going. I'm going to try to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower amount than my initial offer, but still enough to give him a decent share.  I'm hoping that he'll realize it's in his best interest to accept before inflation eats away at his potential gains even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my initial offer, even with the added inflation. I'm going to continue to try to get a better deal for myself.  I'm also getting a little nervous about the amount of time that is passing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly again, but I'm hoping that Bob is starting to realize that the longer we go on, the worse it gets for him due to the inflation.  I need to find a balance between getting a good deal for myself and making sure Bob doesn't completely walk away."
