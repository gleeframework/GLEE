Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it a bit more evenly, we both get a decent share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time.  We'll both get a fair share, and it's better than risking further inflation.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value each round, I'm being generous by not taking more 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's less than I'd prefer, accepting means I get *something* and avoid the risk of getting nothing due to further inflation."
