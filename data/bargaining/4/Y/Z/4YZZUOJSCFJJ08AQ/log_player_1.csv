"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less than the original amount, I can infer that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. With that in mind, I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, as I was hoping for a more even distribution.

However, I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway. I'll accept his offer, but I'll try to negotiate further in the next round.
