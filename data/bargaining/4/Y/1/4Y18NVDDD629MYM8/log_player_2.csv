"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 99% and leave you with 1% -  a good start, wouldn't you say?

# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to make up for the inflation. Let's split it 70/30 this time. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is compromising, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's too early to accept a 30/70 split, even considering the inflation working against her. I need to push for a more equitable outcome."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're approaching the halfway point.  55/45 is a fair split considering the time pressure and the inflation working against you. Let's close this deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing out with each passing round.  Let's try 60/40, a good compromise to avoid getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** While the time pressure is on, accepting 40% now sets a dangerous precedent. Alice knows the inflation is working against her, and my previous offer was reasonable. Holding out for a better deal in the next few rounds is still the best strategy."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering 52.5/47.5. This is a fair compromise considering the time constraint and the increasing impact of inflation on your share. Let's settle this now and avoid walking away with nothing.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer to the end. If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both get nothing. Let's split it 55/45 and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out. While not ideal, this is the same split I offered before. Accepting guarantees a reasonable share rather than risking getting nothing if we both keep pushing our luck."
