Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get a bit more. How about 58 for me and 42 for you? 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, accepting a bad deal now is better than risking getting a worse deal later as inflation eats into my potential gains. Bob is very slowly increasing his offer, and I need to apply pressure.  I'll hold out a bit longer and see if he's willing to move closer to a 50/50 split."
