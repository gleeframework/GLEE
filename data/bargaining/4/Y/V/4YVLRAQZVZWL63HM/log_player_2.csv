Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're losing money with each round, I'm not.  This is my final offer.  Take it or we'll both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's painful, but I have to accept. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing me:**  Each round costs me significantly more than Alice. Waiting any longer means accepting even less later.
* **Alice is being ruthless:** Her strategy is clear - she's betting I'll cave under the pressure of inflation.
* **Something is better than nothing:**  Rejecting this offer means we both get $0.  $100,000 is a significant loss, but it's still better than nothing."
