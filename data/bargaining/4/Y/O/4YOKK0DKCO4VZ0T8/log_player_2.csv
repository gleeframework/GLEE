# Alice gain: 75

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We need to agree before inflation eats up all the value.  I'm standing firm on my previous offer: 70/30. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I prefer a more even split, the inflation is becoming too significant. It's better to accept the offer now and secure some value rather than risk losing everything."
