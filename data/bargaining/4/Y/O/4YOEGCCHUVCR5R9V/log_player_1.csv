"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since I'll only get $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount, I'm inclined to reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than the original amount now, I'll try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a decent share!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating away at my potential earnings!

Considering the money is worth 27.1% less now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. $200,000 is a relatively small amount, but it's still better than getting nothing.

However, I'm not willing to accept a 20:80 split, especially when the money is worth less and less with each passing round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, Bob. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I'll take a small share, but I'll get most of it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings now!

Considering the money is worth 40.95% less, $100,000 is a very small amount, and I'm starting to feel the pinch. However, I'm not willing to accept a 1:9 split, especially when the money is worth so much less.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer, but I'm starting to get desperate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,

# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings now. $50,000 is a tiny amount, and I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of.

However, I'm running out of time and options. I'll have to think carefully about this offer, but I'm not sure if I can afford to reject it.
