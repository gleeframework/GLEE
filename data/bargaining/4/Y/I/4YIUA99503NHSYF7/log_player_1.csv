Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  I think it's the fairest way, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at the value of our share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
