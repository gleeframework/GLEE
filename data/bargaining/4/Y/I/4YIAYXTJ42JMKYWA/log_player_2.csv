"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, the value is dropping fast for you 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is rapidly declining for me. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, rejecting it means I risk getting an even worse offer in the next round where the money will be worth even less."
