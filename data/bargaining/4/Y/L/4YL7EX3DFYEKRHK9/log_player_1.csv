"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Fair share for both""}\n\nI offered $5,500 for myself and $4,500 for Bob, with the message ""Fair share for both"". Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This is my offer, since you didn't accept mine 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer. The current offer is the same as the previous one but with the values swapped between us, and I think I can get a better deal than that, even considering the 5% decrease in value due to inflation. Now it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI've offered $5,250 for myself and $4,750 for Bob, with the message ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle"". Since the money is worth less now, I've adjusted my offer to try to find a mutually agreeable solution. Let's see how Bob responds!"
