"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider the offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll calculate the effective values:

My gain: 60 * 0.95 = 57
Bob's gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32

I'll accept this offer.
