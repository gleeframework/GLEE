"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount, and I'll take the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual amount I'll receive.

Alice gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79 (approximately)

I'll accept this offer.
