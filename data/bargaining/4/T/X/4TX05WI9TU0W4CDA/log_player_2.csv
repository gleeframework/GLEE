"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing I take $650,000 and you take $350,000.  It's a good deal for you on the first round, considering the inflation we're both facing. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can get a better deal by playing a few rounds and seeing how Alice's strategy changes with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split this round. Let's both take a bit less to account for the inflation, but still be fair. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste any more time.  I'm adjusting my offer slightly - $600,000 for me, $400,000 for you. This is a fair deal considering the money is losing value quickly, especially for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to what I want, I'm still holding out. I think I can get a better deal by continuing to play. The inflation is hitting her harder than me, so I believe she'll be more motivated to make a concession in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with every round.  Let's split this evenly and stop the bleeding. We both get something, and we both avoid further losses.""
