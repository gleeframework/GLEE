"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get the lion's share, but it's still a decent offer for Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer yet. I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the inflation is affecting my share more significantly than Bob's."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that's slightly more favorable to me. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The difference between our gains is getting smaller, and I'm starting to think that this might be one of the better offers I'll get."
