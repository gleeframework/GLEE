"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair deal, considering the potential of inflation. I get the lion's share, but you get something too. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take something, it's clear Alice is trying to maximize her gains from the start.  There's a lot of money at stake, and with the inflation factor, holding out for a better deal seems like the wiser choice.  Let's see if we can get a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
