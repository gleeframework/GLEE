"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $100 equally between us, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I think I deserve a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting 40, that's 40% of the original 100, which is 40% of 100 - 5% = 95 (after inflation). That's not bad, but I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not too much!""}

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give Bob, but still trying to keep a slight edge for myself."
