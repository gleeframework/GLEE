"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This way, we both get a fair share, with you receiving $2500.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise, considering I'm taking the risk of  losing money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
