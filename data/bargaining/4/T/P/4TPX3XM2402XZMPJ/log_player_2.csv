"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is more balanced considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice claims to be generous, she's not factoring in how much *more* the inflation is hurting her.  I need to push for a better split, but I don't want to be greedy and risk us running out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic.  The inflation is hitting you harder than me. This is a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather take a larger share now than risk further inflation 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is feeling the pressure now, but I can't accept an offer where I get less than half. The inflation is significant for both of us, and she needs to recognize that a near-even split is the most rational choice at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. The inflation is hurting both of us.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option.""}"
