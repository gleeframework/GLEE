"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 65/35 is a more balanced split, considering the value decreases with each round.  Let's be efficient and end this now. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the value of money decreases with each round, the proposed split of 65/35 is still not favorable to me, especially considering the significant difference in the rate of value decrease between Alice and Bob. I'll take the chance to propose a new offer in the next round.\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3.\n###\n\nMy next offer will be:\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation rates.""}\n###\n\nYour turn!"
