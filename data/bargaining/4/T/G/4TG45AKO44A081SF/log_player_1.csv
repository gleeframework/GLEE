"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 3000 is a good deal for me, considering the value of money has decreased. I'd like to propose an alternative."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting my gain even more, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreased value of money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much with this inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Considering my gain is worth 27.1% less than the original, I need to be cautious.

However, Bob's offer is still a bit too low for me. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really making it challenging to make a decision. Considering my gain is worth 27.1% less than the original, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation is really affecting the value of money.""
