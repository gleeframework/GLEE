"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. The message I've attached is ""Let's be fair"". Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better balance, let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth less now, I need to consider the decreased value. I'll calculate the actual value of the money considering the inflation.\n\nThe money I gain ($4000) is now worth 10% less, so its actual value is $4000 * 0.9 = $3600.\n\nThe money Bob gains ($6000) is now worth 20% less, so its actual value is $6000 * 0.8 = $4800.\n\nGiven this, I still think I can get a better offer, so I will reject this proposal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.\n\nI'll offer Bob $4500, and I'll keep $5500 for myself. Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I gain is $5500 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $4455 (due to two rounds of 10% decrease), and the actual value of the money Bob gains is $4500 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $2880 (due to two rounds of 20% decrease).\n\nMy message to Bob is: ""Considering the inflation, let's try this balance.""\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's try this balance""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what Bob thinks!"
