I'm starting with a slightly unfair proposal. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as he's losing money faster than I am.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy!  He's proposing to take 60% of the money, even though it's worth less to him now. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a good deal for Bob, considering the inflation rate, and it should be more appealing than his last offer."
