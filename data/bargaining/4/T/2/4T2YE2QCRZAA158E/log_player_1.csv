Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  The inflation is killing us both. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is becoming a major factor, and Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise. Accepting ensures we both get something, and the risk of further inflation leading to a worse outcome for me is too great."
