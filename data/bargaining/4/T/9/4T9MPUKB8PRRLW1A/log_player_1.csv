"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going for 50/50. Consider this a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual values are:

Alice gain: $400,000
Bob gain: $570,000

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since the difference between our gains is quite large. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the large difference in our gains. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly smaller difference in our gains. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not willing to give up that much. I'm still hoping for a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice gain: $300,000 (which is 30% of the original $1,000,000)
Bob gain: $700,000 (which is 70% of the original $1,000,000)

I'm not comfortable with this offer, as it's still heavily skewed towards Bob's gain. I'd like to make another counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split. I'll make another offer.""

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up too much more."

# Bob's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to make a stronger move, but I'm not going to give up completely. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice gain: $200,000 (which is 20% of the original $1,000,000)
Bob gain: $800,000 (which is 80% of the original $1,000,000)

This offer is even more skewed towards Bob's gain, and I'm not comfortable with it. I'd like to make another counteroffer.
