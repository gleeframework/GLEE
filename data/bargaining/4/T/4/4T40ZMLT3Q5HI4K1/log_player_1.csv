"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the rejection of my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, I'll try to be more aggressive this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a much smaller share this time, hoping to get a better deal by being more assertive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In the first round, Bob's gain was 200,000, which is now worth 51.2% of its original value due to inflation. In this round, Bob's gain is 700,000, which is worth 51.2% of its original value as well.

Considering the relative values, Bob's offer is actually a significant improvement for him. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to find a balance between being aggressive and being realistic.

Considering the previous rejections, I'll make a more moderate offer this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than I would have liked, but I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to him."
