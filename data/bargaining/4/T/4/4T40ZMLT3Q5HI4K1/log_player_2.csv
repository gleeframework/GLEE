**Explanation:**

While Bob's share is worth significantly less due to inflation, it's still the best offer he's likely to get. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Pattern:** Alice has been consistently offering Bob decreasing amounts while keeping her own share relatively stable. This suggests she's trying to maximize her gains.
* **Inflation's Impact:**  With each round, Bob's buying power is diminishing rapidly.  Accepting this offer, while not ideal, at least secures him a significant portion of the remaining value.
* **Risk of Rejection:** If Bob rejects this offer, he risks Alice proposing an even lower amount in the next round, leaving him with even less.

Therefore, it's strategically advantageous for Bob to accept Alice's offer in round 5."
