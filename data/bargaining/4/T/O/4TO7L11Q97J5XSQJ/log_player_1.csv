Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves a significant portion for Bob. I'm hoping this will be seen as a fair starting point and encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my original offer, and the money is worth less now. I'm not willing to accept this, I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split this round. Given the inflation, I think a fair and even split is the best way to ensure we both get a decent share."
