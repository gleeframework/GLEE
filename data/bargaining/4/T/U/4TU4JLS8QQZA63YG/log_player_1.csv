"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm the one making the offer this round.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get me to accept the same offer as the first round, but with the added pressure of the game clock.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think a 60-40 split is fair, especially considering the inflation. I'm willing to give you more, but I need a better offer.""
}
```

Let's see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need to be cautious with the inflation. This is my best offer for now.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous this round, but I need to make sure I get a good share.  I'm offering a 70/30 split.  Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Bob's offer is a significant improvement over his previous one, but I'm not sure if I want to accept a 70-30 split. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split. I think I can do better than that. I'll give you a counteroffer: 550k for me, 450k for you.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this counteroffer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
