"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, and keeping $80 for myself. My message is an invitation to Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $45 is equivalent to $50 in the previous round's value.

I think an even split is a reasonable proposal, but I'd like to try to get a slightly better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider an even split, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to make it more favorable to me.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so my gain is now worth 90% of the value of $45, which is $40.50.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slight edge. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm now proposing an even split, but with a slight bias towards me."
