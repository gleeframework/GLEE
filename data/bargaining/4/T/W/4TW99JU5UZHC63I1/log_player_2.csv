Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was more balanced. I'm willing to compromise slightly with a 55/45 split in my favor. This ensures we both get a decent amount before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
