"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to set a good tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain of 40 is equivalent to 44 in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 40-60 split, especially since I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and keeping the negotiations going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly better share. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains. Considering the adjusted values, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since my gain of 42 in this round is equivalent to 29.41 in the first round (due to 27.1% less), I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I don't want to reject it and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in future rounds.
