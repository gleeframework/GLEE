"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with a 75/25 split. This might seem a bit lopsided, but consider it a strategic move considering the inflation factor.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more balanced split is fairer, considering the potential of future inflation.  Let's go with 60/40, ensuring we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
