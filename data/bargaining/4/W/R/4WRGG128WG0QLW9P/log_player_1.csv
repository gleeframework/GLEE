```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective gain as $400,000 / 0.8 = $500,000.

I'll reject this offer since I can get more than $500,000 in the next round.
