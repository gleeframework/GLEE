Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is biting, I need a bigger share to make up for the loss. This is my best offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of Bob's share is rapidly declining.  Even though he's asking for 6000, the inflation means it's worth significantly less to him than it was in earlier rounds.
* **Potential for Loss:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will offer me even less in the next round due to the continuing inflation on his end.  
* **Certainty:** Accepting guarantees I get something now. Rejecting carries the risk of ending up with a worse deal or nothing at all if we can't agree.

While 4000 is less than I aimed for, it's better to secure a reasonable amount than risk losing more value to the relentless inflation."
