"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation rate. This ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to try and get a better deal, despite the decreasing value of money due to inflation. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split. If we keep going, the money's value will drop even more, so let's settle on this.""}\n\n###\nI've made an offer that takes into account the inflation rate and its impact on both of us, but still slightly favors me. Hopefully, Alice will find it acceptable and we can conclude the game here."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is hurting us both. Let's be reasonable and split this evenly now before it's worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the impact of inflation on the value of the money, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action. The value of the money is decreasing with each round, and splitting it evenly at this point ensures I still receive a significant amount. Continuing the game risks further devaluation, so it's prudent to accept Alice's offer now."
