"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about the 30% offer from Bob. I was hoping for a better deal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 30% for me, I'm thinking that I might be able to get a better deal if I make a new offer. I'll try to get a bit more, but not too greedy.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the total amount and Bob gets 45%."
