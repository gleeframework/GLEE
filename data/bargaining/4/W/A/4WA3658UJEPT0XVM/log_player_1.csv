"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on. I'm assuming Bob might not be aware of the inflation factor yet, and might accept a deal that's slightly unfavorable for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is slightly more favorable to me than my initial offer, I'm going to reject it. I'm aware of the inflation factor, and I know that his offer is likely influenced by it.  I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a more balanced split this time.  I'm assuming Bob is now aware of the inflation factor and will be more cautious with his offers. This offer is still fairly advantageous for me, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince him to accept, avoiding another round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better for me than my last proposal. Even though the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, the offer is still quite advantageous for him.  I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game, as the risk of further inflation could make future negotiations even more challenging."
