"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems fair at face value, the impact of inflation is significant. Alice loses value at twice the rate of Bob with each passing round. It's in Bob's best interest to wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's make this a bit more worthwhile for me. This offer considers the impact of inflation on both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** Bob needs to make a counter-offer that acknowledges Alice's desire for a larger share while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Inflation Factor:**  Highlighting the inflation impact subtly reminds Alice that waiting too long hurts her more than him.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for further negotiation. Bob isn't pushing for an extreme split immediately."
