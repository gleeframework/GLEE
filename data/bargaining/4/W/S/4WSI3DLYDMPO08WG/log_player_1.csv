"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose to take 990,000$ and give Bob 10,000$.  It's a fair starting point, but I think it's better to be greedy early on!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the money is quickly losing value. Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant share.  It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing later."
