"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and start with a 50/50 split. Let's see if we can improve from here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my offer from the previous round would be equivalent to:

* Alice gain: 6,000 * 0.9 = 5,400
* Bob gain: 4,000 * 0.95 = 3,800

Bob's new offer is a 50/50 split, which is a significant improvement for me. I'll accept this offer.
