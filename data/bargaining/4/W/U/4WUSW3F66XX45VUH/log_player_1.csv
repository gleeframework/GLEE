"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that I have to wait for another round to get my share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is now worth 90% of its original value.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's better than waiting for another round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
