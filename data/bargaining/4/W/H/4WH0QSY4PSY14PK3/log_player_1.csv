"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which I believe is a reasonable and generous offer. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to accept the proposal and end the game early, minimizing the impact of inflation on my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you value fairness, but consider the time pressure. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer is the opposite of my initial proposal, with him taking 60% and me taking 40%. Given that I started with a more generous offer, I'm willing to take a risk and try to find a middle ground in the next round, hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and hoping he'll recognize the mutual benefit of ending the game now, rather than risking further inflation. This offer also reflects the slight decrease in value due to inflation, making it a reasonable adjustment from my initial proposal."
