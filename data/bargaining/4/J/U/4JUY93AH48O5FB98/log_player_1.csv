Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"

# Bob's message: Let's try 30-70, a small step towards fairness 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal. I'll make a new proposal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."

# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 75-25 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but only because I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse deal.
