"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, I'll meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16
* Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. It's a 50-50 split, but I'm getting a slightly better deal due to the inflation. However, I'm not sure if I should take the risk of waiting for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, so the effective amount is:

* My gain: 5263.16 / 0.95 = 5541.69
* Bob's gain: 5555.56 / 0.9 = 6162.22

Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this round, but I'm still looking for a good deal.""
}
```

This offer is a 55-45 split, which is slightly better for me than the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You gave me a bit more last round, I'll return the favor this time 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, so the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 4500 / 0.8634 = 5205.47
* Bob's gain: 5500 / 0.7273 = 7550.49

Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Bob is getting a better deal than me, and I'm not sure if I should wait for a better offer.

However, I'm running out of time, and this might be one of the last good offers I'll get.
