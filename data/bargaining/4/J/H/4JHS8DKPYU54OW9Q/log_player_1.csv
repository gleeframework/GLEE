"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous 10% of the total amount. I'm keeping the remaining 90% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go, Alice. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth only 90% of its original value, so it's effectively $450,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of its original value or 90% of its original value, but I'll assume it's 95% for now.

Considering the offer, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable one, and I'm willing to accept it. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting the better deal, considering the inflation effect on my gain.
