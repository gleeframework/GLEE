"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with. It's a fair and simple offer.""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more for making the first offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit lopsided, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more for being flexible.""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor than my initial offer, but still gives me a decent share. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is really losing value quickly! I'm not thrilled about the 35/65 split, but I'm running out of options. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I think I deserve a bigger share. Let's make it 50/50 again, but this time I'm willing to compromise.""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally again, hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
