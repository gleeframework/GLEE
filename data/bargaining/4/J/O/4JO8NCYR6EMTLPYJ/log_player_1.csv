"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me getting 8,000 dollars and Bob getting 2,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of 6000 dollars is actually worth 6000 / 0.8 = 7500 dollars in the first round's value.

I'll consider the offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation, my gain of 6000 dollars is actually worth 6000 / 0.6 = 10,000 dollars in the first round's value. I'll keep this in mind when making my next offer.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my gain in the first round's value: 5000 / 0.5168 (1 - 0.4832) = 9693.59

I'll consider the offer... It seems like a reasonable compromise. I'll accept the offer.
