Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a fair start, considering the inflation rates.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the inflation.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get at least half of the money."
