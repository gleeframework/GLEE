Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 40/60 is a more reasonable split. It's not too far from your initial offer, and it's still better than the 10/90 split we'd get with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
