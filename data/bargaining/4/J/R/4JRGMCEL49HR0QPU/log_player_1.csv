"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split in your favor.  Since Bob loses 20% of the value per round, this is a good starting point for him to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

I propose a 8500/1500 split in my favor.  Since Bob loses 20% of the value per round, this is a good starting point for him to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation.  The money I gain is worth less than in round 1, but I'm still getting a good share of the money.  Bob is losing a lot of money, so he may not be able to get a better deal."
