"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm actually gaining more in real terms than Bob is.

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll try to make a better offer this time.

Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm increasing my gain slightly, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is biting!

Okay, let's analyze the offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm actually gaining less in real terms than Bob is.

However, considering the decreasing value of money, I think this offer is still relatively fair. I'll accept it.
