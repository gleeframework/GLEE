"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer. I'm hoping that Bob will be tempted to accept it quickly, especially since he knows he's not losing any value on his share with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I will reject this offer. I can do better than $10, and I'm willing to take the risk of going to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $70, but I think it's still a good deal considering the inflation. Bob is likely to accept it to avoid further rounds where he might get a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I will reject this offer. Even though the inflation is hitting me hard, I still think I can get a better deal than $20. I'm willing to risk going to the next round and potentially getting a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going for a more balanced offer this time. Inflation is really starting to hurt, and I need to secure a decent share before it gets too low. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair offer and accept it."
