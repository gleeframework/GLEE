"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money. Since the value of the money decreases for me with each round, I want to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, I'm still in a better position to secure more money. My gains are worth 20% less with each passing round, so I'm not going to accept this offer until I absolutely have to.  I'm going to force Bob to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}
```

I'm proposing a 72/28 split in my favor.  Since my share is worth 20% less each round, I need to secure as much as I can now. While Bob might prefer a 50/50 split, I think he'll realize that if he rejects this offer, he risks losing out on any potential profit in the next round."
