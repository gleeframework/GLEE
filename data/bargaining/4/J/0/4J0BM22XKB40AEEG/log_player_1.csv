"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer is a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as it is a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a much worse offer for me than my initial proposal. I think I can do better by rejecting this offer and making my own counterproposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to stick with a 55/45 split in my favor, but I'm going to offer Bob slightly more this time to see if he's willing to accept. The inflation should be a big enough incentive for him."
