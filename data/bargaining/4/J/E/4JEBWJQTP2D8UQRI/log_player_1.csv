"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a chance to accept or reject.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original $100. I'll keep $80 for myself, which is 80% of the original $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for me since I'm the one making the proposal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $70 is actually worth 95% of the original $80, which is $76. And Bob's gain of $30 is worth 80% of the original $20, which is $16.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
