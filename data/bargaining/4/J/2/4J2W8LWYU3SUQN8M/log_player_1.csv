"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more reasonable offer this time. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 45-55""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, hoping he'll be more willing to accept this offer."
