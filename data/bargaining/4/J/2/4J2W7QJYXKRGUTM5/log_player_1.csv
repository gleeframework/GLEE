{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I propose Alice gets $810,000 and Bob gets $190,000. This offer accounts for the inflation that has occurred since the last round.  Even with a reduced value, Alice is still getting a significant portion of the money."

While it's tempting to accept this offer, the inflation is really hurting Alice. The game is rigged in Bob's favor, so Alice needs to keep pushing for a more equitable split."
