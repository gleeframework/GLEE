7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. Let me know if you agree.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a 55/45 split in my favor is fair considering the inflation that will kick in if we go to another round. Let's finish this!,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Considering the inflation, I suggest a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This balances the previous rounds and accounts for potential future value loss. Let me know what you think.",Alice,3,
