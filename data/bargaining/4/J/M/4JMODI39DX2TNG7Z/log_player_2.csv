"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept. While the offer is reasonable, there's a good chance I can negotiate a better deal for myself, especially since Alice's money is losing value faster."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better for both of us. This split is more equitable, given the potential for inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting us both, and this back and forth isn't helping. My offer is still generous considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is tempting, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm losing value more slowly than Alice, so I have a slight advantage. I'll see if I can get her to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than your last offer. Let's find a solution that benefits us both before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking out for yourself, but I need a decent share too. This offer is a compromise, and we're running out of time before inflation makes this whole thing pointless. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is right, we're running out of time. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me some money.  I don't want to risk losing everything to inflation."
