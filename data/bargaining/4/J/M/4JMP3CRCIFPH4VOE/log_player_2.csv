Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: That's still too low for me, Bob. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - this offer considers the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, you drive a hard bargain. This is my counter offer. We need to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value decreases significantly.  Waiting longer means a smaller pot for both of us.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if I could secure a slightly better deal in later rounds, the impact of inflation means the actual gain would be minimal. 
* **Alice's Position Weakening:** Alice's offers have been getting progressively worse for her.  While she might hold out for another round or two, the pressure is on her as well.

Accepting 450,000 now is better than risking a much smaller amount later or even walking away with nothing."
