"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we need to worry about. Let's get this done!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn, Bob. This offer still gives you a sizable chunk while acknowledging the impact of inflation on my end. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it.  Inflation is getting worse, and this offer is a good deal compared to what we could end up with if we keep rejecting each other."
