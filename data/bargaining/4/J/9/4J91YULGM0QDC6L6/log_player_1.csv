"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 999,999 dollars, and give Bob 1 dollar.  This is a strategic first move as it minimizes my risk. If Bob rejects, I'll be in a position to offer a slightly less favorable split in the next round, while still securing a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most rational choice.  The value of my potential future earnings has been significantly reduced by inflation, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything at all in the next round.  A 50/50 split, while not ideal, is a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
