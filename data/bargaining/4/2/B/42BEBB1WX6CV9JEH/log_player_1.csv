"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $200,000. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up $900,000 for just $100,000. The game is not over yet!"

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal this time. You'll get $400,000. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a bit more generous than his previous offer, but still a good deal for me."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to get the better deal.

I'll reject his offer again:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'll reject his offer again:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet! You'll get $580,000. It's my final offer!""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a very last-ditch effort to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""Fine, I'll give you most of it. You'll get $800,000. Take it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob the majority of the remaining amount, but I'm still trying to hold on to a small portion for myself. This is my final offer."
