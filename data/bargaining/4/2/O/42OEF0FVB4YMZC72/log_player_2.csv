Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40 this time.  We can keep moving towards a more even split in the future. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
