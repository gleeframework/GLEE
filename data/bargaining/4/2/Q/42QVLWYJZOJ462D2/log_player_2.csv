"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, $10,000 is equivalent to $8,000 for me.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less for me now, $10,000 is equivalent to $6,400 for me. 

Alice's offer is $2,000, which is 31.25% of $6,400. This is a relatively good deal for me, considering the decreasing value of the money.
