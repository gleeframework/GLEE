"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept. I'll see how he reacts and adjust my strategy for the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me, even with inflation taken into account. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for inflation, but still aiming for a majority share. Bob rejected my previous offer, so I'm adjusting to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is incredibly unfair, even with inflation factored in. I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round. While I'm losing value due to inflation, Bob is losing value too, but at a lower rate.  I need to stay firm and try to leverage that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more aggressive approach this round, aiming for 70% of the money.  Bob seems to be more interested in a larger share, but I'm hoping the inflation factor will push him towards accepting this offer.  If not, I'll need to adjust my strategy again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly insulting at this point. Even with inflation, I'm getting a tiny fraction of the money. I'm going to stick to my guns and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to stick to my strategy of offering a majority share, but I'm lowering the amount I'm asking for slightly to account for the continued inflation. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, as he's clearly focused on getting a larger share of the money.  If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider my options for the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is utterly ridiculous, even with the heavy inflation.  Bob is trying to take nearly everything, leaving me with a pittance.  I'm going to push for a better deal in the final round, even if it means getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is the final round.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. Bob is clearly trying to maximize his gains, and I'm not willing to accept anything less than a fair share.  It's a gamble, but I believe a 50/50 split is the most likely outcome given the current circumstances."
