Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it evenly!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the significant imbalance in the proposed split. I was hoping for a more equitable distribution, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really not happy with the direction this is going. The inflation is taking a toll on my share, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lopsided. I'm starting to feel like I'm getting desperate, but I'm not ready to give in just yet. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

I'm really struggling with the inflation and the fact that my share is dwindling rapidly. However, I'm not willing to accept this offer. The disparity between our shares is huge, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and hope that Bob will come back with a more reasonable proposal."
