"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the decreasing value of the money over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: The offer seems to favor Alice, and considering the decreasing value of money, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I have more to gain by waiting and potentially getting a better offer. Additionally, Alice's argument about the split reflecting the decreasing value of money doesn't seem convincing, as the split she proposed doesn't take into account the difference in depreciation rates between us. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think this split is more reasonable. The money is worth less for both of us with each passing round, but it depreciates faster for you. This offer takes that into account.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where I'm getting a decent deal. If you reject this, we'll both lose out significantly. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Considering the significant depreciation of the money's value for both of us, especially for Alice, I think this offer is more reasonable than the initial one. Alice's argument about this being the last round for a decent deal holds some truth, as further rounds will see the money's value decrease even more drastically. Given that I initially sought a better deal and Alice has come closer to a compromise, accepting this offer seems like the most pragmatic decision to ensure we both get a fair share before the money's value drops further. Rejecting and going into another round might not yield a significantly better offer, and the loss due to inflation could outweigh any potential gains from holding out."
