Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I think this split is more reasonable. The money is worth less for both of us with each passing round, but it depreciates faster for you. This offer takes that into account. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
