"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to start, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next rounds.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a small amount to keep him interested, while keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your initial offer, but I'm not sure if I'll be so generous in the future. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll be gaining 4500$ instead of 5000$. Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he'll be gaining 4000$ instead of 5000$.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this is a relatively fair offer. I'll accept it.
