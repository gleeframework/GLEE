Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 50

This is a tough one! While ideally, I'd want more, accepting Bob's offer in round 4 is the smartest move due to the rapid inflation:

* **Declining the offer:** If I reject Bob's offer, the value of the money will decrease significantly for me in the next round. Even if I were to propose a 55/45 split in my favor and Bob accepted, the actual value I receive would be less than the 50/50 split offered now. 

* **Time pressure:** With only a few rounds left, continuing to gamble could leave me with a much smaller amount or even nothing.

Bob's offer, while not ideal, is fair and ensures I get a reasonable amount before inflation further erodes the value."
