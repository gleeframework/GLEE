"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, I'm the only one who deserves it.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good chunk, but not all of it 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll consider that when making my decision.

I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's see what happens next!"
