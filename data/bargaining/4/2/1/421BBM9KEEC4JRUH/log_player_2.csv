"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a split of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. Let's agree on this fair division. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's a decent starting point, but I'm hoping to get a larger share. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 60/40 in your favor, but I'll need to see a more even split if we want to reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I think it's fair to split the money equally now. This way, both of us receive $5000, ensuring stability in our shares. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation factor is significant.  Accepting the 50/50 split ensures I get something, and it seems like a fair solution given the changing circumstances."
