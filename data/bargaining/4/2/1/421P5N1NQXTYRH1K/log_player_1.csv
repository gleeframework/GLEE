I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000. Since this is the first round, the money still has its full value. I want to maximize my gains while still offering Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The money is now worth less due to inflation, and if I reject, there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything in the next round.  It's better to take the $6000 now than risk getting nothing."
