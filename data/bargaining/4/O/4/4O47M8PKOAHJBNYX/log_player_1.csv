"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

This is a simple and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm taking the majority 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share!

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 30% of the money. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something fair""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my first one, but still gives me a decent share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm taking the majority again 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his strategy of trying to take the majority of the money!

However, I'm not impressed with this offer. The inflation has taken a bigger bite out of the money, and I'm not willing to accept a share that's worth less in real terms.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep waiting for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a smaller majority, but I need a decent share""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous to Bob, but still gives me a larger share than my previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
