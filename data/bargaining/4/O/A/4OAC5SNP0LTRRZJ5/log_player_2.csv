"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice, the total value of the money is now 90% of 100$ for me and 95% of 100$ for Alice.

I'll make a proposal to divide the money as follows:

{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... Alice's offer is the same as mine from Round 2, but the values are now lower due to inflation. I'm not going to fall for that!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice compared to the first round, the total value of the money is now 81% of 100% of 100$ for me and 90.25% of 100% of 100$ for Alice.

I'll make a new proposal to divide the money as follows:

{""bob_gain"": 32, ""alice_gain"": 68}"
