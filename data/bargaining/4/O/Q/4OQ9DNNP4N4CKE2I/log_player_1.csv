Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a better deal for both of us. Since we're both starting to feel the pressure of the shrinking dollar, I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
