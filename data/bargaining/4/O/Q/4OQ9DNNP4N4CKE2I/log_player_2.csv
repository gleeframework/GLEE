Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a better deal for both of us. Since we're both starting to feel the pressure of the shrinking dollar, I believe this is a fair compromise.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the pressure of inflation, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me. This time I'm proposing a 65/35 split.  It benefits us both to settle now before the money loses more value, especially for you. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
