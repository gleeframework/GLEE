"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer.  I want to see how Bob reacts and what his priorities are.  If he rejects, we'll see how the inflation affects his decision making in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal.  He's taking advantage of the inflation to get a much larger share. I'm going to reject this and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share, but I'm still aiming for a majority.  The inflation is starting to take its toll, but I believe I can still get a better deal than Bob's last offer.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, Bob's offer is the best I've seen so far.  His share has reduced considerably, and I'm not sure I can negotiate a better deal in the next round.  It's time to take the offer and end this game."
