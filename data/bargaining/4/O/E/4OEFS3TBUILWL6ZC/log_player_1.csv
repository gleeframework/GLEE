"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, to see if Bob is interested in accepting the offer or if he wants to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that, Alice. I'm willing to give you a small share, but I want the majority of the money. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the majority of the money. I'm not interested in that. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not fair, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a bit more than half. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to 6000, which is more than half of the total amount, but still leaves a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you the majority, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share than before. It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get closer to his desired share, but still wants to take the majority of the money. I'm not interested in this offer, as it's still very uneven.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""No, Bob, I don't think this is a fair compromise. I need a more equal split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share slightly, to 5500, and leaving 4500 for Bob. This is a more equal split than before, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
