# Bob gain: 600000

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

The inflation is reaching a critical point. It's time to propose a 50/50 split.  This offer is fair considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, and it could be the only way to secure any money at all for both of us."
