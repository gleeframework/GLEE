# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm holding out for a better deal. While the time pressure is on, accepting an offer where I consistently get less than half isn't ideal."

# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to start getting serious. While the offer is tempting, I can't accept anything less than half if I want to come out ahead in this scenario."

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. Inflation is killing your share. Take this deal before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm cornered.  While this isn't ideal, with the inflation working against me, it's only going to get worse from here. Accepting is the best way to salvage something from this situation."
