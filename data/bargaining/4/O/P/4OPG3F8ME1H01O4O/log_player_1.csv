"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try and maximize my share while still being reasonable.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer means I get at least something, and the inflation will only make things worse for me in future rounds."
