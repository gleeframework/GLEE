"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, 50-50 this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I think 50-50 is a fair proposal, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll try to take advantage of that. I'll make a new offer that's slightly more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect it to last!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up! With Bob's gain worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to be careful not to give away too much.

However, 5200 is a significant amount, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll think carefully before making a decision.
