"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $320,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 remains the same.

I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer from Round 1 would be worth less now. To make a more attractive offer, I'll try to give Bob a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
