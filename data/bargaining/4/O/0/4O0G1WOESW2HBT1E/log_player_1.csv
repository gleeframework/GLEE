{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overcomplicate things!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's trying to take a 60/40 split, which is too lopsided in his favor. I'm willing to give him a slightly better offer, but not this extreme. I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. He's trying to take an even larger share of the money, and I'm not willing to give in. I think he's trying to bluff me into accepting a bad deal. I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
