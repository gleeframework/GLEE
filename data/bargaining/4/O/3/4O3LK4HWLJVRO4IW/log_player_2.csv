``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still heavily favoring her.  The rate of inflation is hurting her more than me, making it increasingly risky for her to keep pushing for a larger share. I'm betting she'll concede more in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable split considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's close this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but I'm also drawing a line in the sand. This split is still advantageous to me considering the faster rate of inflation on Alice's side, and the ""final offer"" language adds pressure for her to accept."
