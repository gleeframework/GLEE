"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point.  It's a fair deal considering our inflation rates, and gives us both a decent amount to work with.  Let's see if we can find a way to agree! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
