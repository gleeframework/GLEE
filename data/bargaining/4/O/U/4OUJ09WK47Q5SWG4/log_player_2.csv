"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, Bob. I'll take the bigger share this time, but we can always adjust in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's not a good deal for me. Even though the offer is ""fair"" in terms of starting point, we only have 12 rounds to get to an agreement, and Alice's money will be worth 20% less each round. It's better to hold out and see if I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point.  It's a fair deal considering our inflation rates, and gives us both a decent amount to work with.  Let's see if we can find a way to agree!""}
