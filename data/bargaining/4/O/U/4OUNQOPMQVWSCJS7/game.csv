6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and split the money while it's worth the most. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Your split was a bit too much in your favor.  I'm proposing a more balanced 55/45 split.  Take it now, or risk getting even less next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, your greed is showing. I'm willing to be generous and keep the same 55/45 split, but in my favor this time. It's a fair offer considering the inflation. Take it or leave it.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking another hit from inflation, so I'm adjusting my offer slightly.  This is your last chance to make a deal before the pot shrinks even further!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's clear we're both feeling the pressure from inflation. Let's stop wasting time and split the money evenly. 50/50.  It's the fairest option at this point.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
