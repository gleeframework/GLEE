Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject this offer because it's still not favorable to me, considering the reduced value of money due to inflation.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value of money. Here's my new offer:

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll accept this offer. It's still a 50-50 split, but the reduced value of the money makes it a more favorable outcome for me.
