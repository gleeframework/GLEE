Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth less for both of us, but the difference is more pronounced for Bob.

I'll think for a moment... and decide to...
