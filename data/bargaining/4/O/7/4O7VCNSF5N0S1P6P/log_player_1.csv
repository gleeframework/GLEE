"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small portion, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split considering we both lose money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable and agree to this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something more than 45. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being reasonable."
