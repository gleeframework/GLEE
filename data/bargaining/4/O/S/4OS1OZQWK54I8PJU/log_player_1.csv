Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario.  I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept in the first round.  He might not, but that's part of the game!  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and while I'm not thrilled with the 50/50 split, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  The risk of continued rounds and inflation is too high.  Let's end this now."
