"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob! Take it or leave it, but next round I'll be taking a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While I lose money to inflation faster than Alice, there's a lot of room for negotiation here.  I'm willing to gamble that she'll offer a much better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a more equitable split. Take it and we both win.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure what you're playing at, Bob, but this is my final offer.  It's the fairest way to split the money, and we both get a decent amount. Let's not keep playing this game and lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right, this is getting dangerous. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal considering I lose money faster to inflation, getting $5000 is much better than nothing. It's time to cut my losses and accept a reasonable offer."
