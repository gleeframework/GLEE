"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is fair, considering the decreasing value of the money.  It gives you a good share while still ensuring I get a decent amount. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
