"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but the value decreases rapidly for you. This is a fair offer considering the time constraint.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the rapid inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is better now than if I wait for the next round. While I could try for a slightly better split in round 4, there's no guarantee Alice would offer more, and the value will decrease further."
