"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but the value decreases rapidly for you. This is a fair offer considering the time constraint. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I'm Alice, I will decide whether to accept Bob's offer or proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of 4500 for me is actually equivalent to 3600 in the first round (4500 / 1.2 = 3750, but since this is the second round, it's actually 3750, but 20% less than original 4500 I could have taken if it was the first round for this amount, so 3600 is a better measure). However, I initially asked for 6000, which is now also worth less due to inflation. Given these conditions, I still believe I can negotiate for a larger share, despite the decreasing value of the money. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how the game unfolds in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince we're in the third round, I need to take into account the inflation again. The money is now worth 20% less for me compared to the second round (and 40% less than the original amount), and 5% less for Bob compared to the second round (and 10% less than the original amount).\n\n###\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll propose a division that still favors me but takes into account the urgency of the situation due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nHere's my offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the rapid inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
