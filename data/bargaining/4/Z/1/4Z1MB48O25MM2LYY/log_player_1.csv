Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. I'll see if he's feeling generous!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'm not getting the vast majority of the money, I'm getting half, which is better than risking getting less in the future."
