Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you going first, Alice.  I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself, as the value of the money is decreasing each round.  Let's split it fairly, but also be mindful of the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
