"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a decent amount for both""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable option. We both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I don't want to risk going to another round and losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
