Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one! My reasoning for accepting:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Waiting any longer means getting even less. 
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems to be fixated on getting a larger share and is unlikely to budge much in future rounds. 
* **Better Than Nothing:** While $40 is less than I aimed for, it's better than risking another rejection and getting an even worse deal in a later round."
