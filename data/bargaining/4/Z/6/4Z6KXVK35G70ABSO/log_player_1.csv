"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a very generous offer from Bob!

I'll have to think carefully... Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still get $200,000, but for Bob, the money is worth 20% less, so he'll get $640,000 (800,000 x 0.8).

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob. This is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still the one who's going to come out ahead 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another tough decision!

Let's calculate the actual values:

* My gain: $300,000 (worth the same as in the first round)
* Bob's gain: $700,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 48.8% less than the original $800,000, so it's actually $416,000 (700,000 x 0.5882)

I'll reject this offer, as I think I can do better.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50. No more negotiations, just a clean split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
