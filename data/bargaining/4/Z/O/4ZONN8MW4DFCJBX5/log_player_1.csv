"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a good starting point, and it gives me a decent chunk of the money to work with."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I was hoping to get a bit more, considering I was willing to start with a 80/20 split. Meeting in the middle doesn't give me enough. I'd like to try to negotiate further."

I'm not happy with this offer. I was hoping to get a bit more, considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money I gain. Bob is getting a larger share, and I don't think it's fair. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if we can find a better split."

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the total amount, which is $5,500, and Bob gets 45%, which is $4,500. I'm trying to find a compromise that gets me closer to my initial target, but still gives Bob a decent share."

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. The inflation has already taken a huge toll on the value of the money I gain, and now Bob is trying to take advantage of that. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic imbalance. I'd like to try to negotiate further and find a more fair split."
