"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'll start by proposing a division that's heavily in my favor,  as the first round has the highest value. We'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, taking a 50/50 split is a good deal in this situation. The inflation is affecting my potential gains significantly, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the future."
