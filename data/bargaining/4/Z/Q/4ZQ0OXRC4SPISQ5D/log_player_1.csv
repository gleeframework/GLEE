Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer to the end. This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you a little more since time is money for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

This is a tough situation, but it's likely the best offer I'll get. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me with each round.  Waiting any longer will significantly reduce my potential gain.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer is slowly getting better. It's unlikely he'll offer me significantly more than this, especially since he knows the pressure is on me due to the inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could hold out hope for a better offer in Round 5, the potential decrease in value is too risky. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount."
