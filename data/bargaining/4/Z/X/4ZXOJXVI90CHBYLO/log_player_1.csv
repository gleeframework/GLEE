"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also ready to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I wanted 90% of the money,  getting 60% is still a significant portion, especially with inflation. There's a risk that Bob will reject my next offer, so accepting this offer seems like a better option."
