Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. While my potential gains are decreasing, hers remain the same. I need to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking further inflation. Accepting $40 now is a bad deal compared to the potential of getting $45 or even $55 in earlier rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Continuing to demand more than Alice is willing to offer is becoming increasingly risky. The longer the game goes on, the more value I lose due to inflation. Offering a 50/50 split is a fair compromise that guarantees me a reasonable share, even with the inflation penalty. It signals to Alice that I'm serious about ending the game and willing to negotiate a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I'm taking advantage 
# Bob gain: 37 
# Alice gain: 63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, I am getting desperate. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and she's clearly not budging from her strategy of offering me less and less. Accepting $37 now, while far from ideal, is better than risking another round where she might offer me even less, or I'm forced to accept an even worse deal due to the increasing inflation penalty."
