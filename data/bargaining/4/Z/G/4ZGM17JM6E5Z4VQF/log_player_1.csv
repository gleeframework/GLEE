"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite steep. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It accounts for the time value of money for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
