"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and straightforward offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual amount of money I'll receive.

With this offer, I'll get $3,000, which is less than my initial offer of $5,000. However, I'm not sure what the inflation rate is for Bob, so I don't know how much he's gaining in real terms.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive, considering the fact that Bob's offer was $7,000 for him and $3,000 for me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than that, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more for myself, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice! I'll give you a bit more, but don't think you're getting away with it that easily! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the 14.26% decrease in value, Bob's offer is actually worth $5,159.40 for him and $3,840 for me.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make a decision. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I'll take this offer. It's not great, but it's better than walking away with nothing.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
