"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it in a way that we both benefit, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not sure that offer is fair, considering the inflation effects on our gains. I think we can do better. Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation will impact your gains more than mine. Let's end this now and both walk away with a decent amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the rising impact of inflation, particularly on your end, this offer should be more appealing as it still gives you a substantial amount that's worth more now than it would be in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting my gains hard. This offer gives me a decent amount that's worth more now than what I might get in the next round. It's time to end this game."
