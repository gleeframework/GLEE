4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. I'm willing to take on the bigger loss in value to get a bit more upfront.",Bob,2,

6300.0,3700.0,"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to take a hit on the value, but I need a bit more security. How about $6,300 for me and $3,700 for you? This accounts for the inflation we both face.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I understand your need for security, but I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more to offset my losses.",Bob,4,

6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and the money is losing value fast. This is my final offer: $6,500 for me, and $3,500 for you. It's the best I can offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,5,
