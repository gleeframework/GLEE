"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing with each round!

I'm not too thrilled about taking only 300,000, but I suppose it's still better than nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer this time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
