Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets $1,000."

# Bob's message: A fair start, let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $6,000 is worth 5% less than my initial gain of $9,000, which is $8,100.

I'll think about Bob's offer... 

I'll reject this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
