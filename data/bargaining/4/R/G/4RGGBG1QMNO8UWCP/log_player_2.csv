**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but Alice is playing hardball and time is now my worst enemy.  Here's why I have to accept:

* **Inflation:** At round 7, I'm losing almost half the value of the initial amount with each passing round. Waiting any longer is financial suicide.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Her ""final offer"" language, combined with her consistent offers, tells me she's unlikely to budge.
* **Something is better than nothing:** 300,000 is a lot less than I wanted, but it's infinitely better than the 0 I'll get if we reach round 12."
