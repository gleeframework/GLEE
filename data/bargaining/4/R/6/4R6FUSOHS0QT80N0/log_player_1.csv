I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm being generous, but I want to secure a good amount before the value starts to drop."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation and the fact that Bob gets a bigger hit from it."
