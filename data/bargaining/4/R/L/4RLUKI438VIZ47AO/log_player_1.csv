I'm going to propose a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor. While I'd love a bigger share, I want to be fair and make sure Bob gets something, especially since I know the money will lose value in future rounds.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation rate is making the money less valuable with each round. A 500,000/500,000 split is a fair outcome, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
