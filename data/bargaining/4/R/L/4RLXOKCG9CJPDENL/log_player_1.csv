"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a very lopsided split. I'm confident Bob will accept, knowing that if he rejects, he might get nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's a fair split, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next rounds."
