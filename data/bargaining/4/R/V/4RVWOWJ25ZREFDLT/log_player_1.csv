"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get a better deal, Alice. This proposal is still fair and equal, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
