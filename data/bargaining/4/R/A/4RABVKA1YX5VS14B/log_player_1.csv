"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, with me getting $7,000 and Bob getting $3,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept or counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to make a counteroffer 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob has made a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to accept a 60:40 split. I'll wait for his next offer to see if he'll come closer to my desired ratio."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55:45 split, trying to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob has made another counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because I'm willing to accept a 45:55 split, especially since I'm getting less money due to inflation. I'm hoping we can finally wrap up the game!"
