"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 90% and you get 10%. Let's start with a fair split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, which is a relatively generous offer for Bob, considering the inflation factor. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50-50 is the best option for me. I'd like to keep negotiating.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70% and you get 30%. It's a good balance between fairness and my compensation for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more to avoid further rounds and the risk of losing more value due to inflation. Let's settle this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains! Given the current state of the money, I think Bob's offer is a good one. I'd rather accept this offer and get 40% of the remaining value than risk losing even more value in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept your offer. 40% is better than nothing!""
}
```"
