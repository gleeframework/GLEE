"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. A 60-40 split seems like a reasonable starting point, considering the time pressure I'm under. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $450,000 is actually equivalent to $360,000 in the first round (450,000 / 1.2). Considering I initially offered myself $600,000, I believe I can still get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'm actually offering less value to myself compared to the first round. However, I want to try to find a middle ground with Bob, considering his previous offer. Let's see if he's willing to accept this compromise!"
