"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
