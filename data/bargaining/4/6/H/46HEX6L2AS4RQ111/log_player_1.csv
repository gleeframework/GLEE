"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a fair starting point, and it gives us a good chance to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by the inflation as Bob is.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for now. I think I can do better than 20%.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing that we split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting 50%. This is a more aggressive move on my part, but I think it's a fair compromise considering Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of the money, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting more aggressive! I'm not happy about the 90-10 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by the inflation as Bob is.

However, I think I can do better than 10%. I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk""}

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer. I'm willing to give Bob a bigger share, but I still want to keep a significant portion of the money for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
