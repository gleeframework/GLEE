"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but it's still a fair offer. Accept and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $30 is worth 20% less than the $60 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $48. And Bob's gain of $70 is worth 10% less than the $40 he would have gotten in the first round, which is $36.

However, I'm not convinced that this offer is fair, especially considering the inflation effect. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's getting late, let's meet in the middle. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
