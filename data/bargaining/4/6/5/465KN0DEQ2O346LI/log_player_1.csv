Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 400000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but the clock is ticking and we both lose out the longer this drags on. This offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is becoming more reasonable, and the effects of inflation are starting to really hurt.  Here's why accepting makes sense now:

* **Significant Inflation Impact:** We're in Round 4. Bob has lost almost half the value of his potential earnings since Round 1. This puts significant pressure on him to make a deal.
* **Better Than Round 3:** Bob increased his offer to Alice from Round 3, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If we reject, there's no guarantee we'll get a better offer from Bob in Round 5. He might become even more stubborn due to the inflation pressure, and we'll both lose out even more. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes a good deal is better than holding out for a perfect one that might never come."
