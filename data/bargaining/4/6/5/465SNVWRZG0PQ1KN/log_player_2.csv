"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such an uneven starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split. This ensures a fairer outcome considering the decreasing value over time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable.  The clock is ticking and the value is decreasing. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation by making it seem like she's compromising. However, her offer is still heavily weighted in her favor, especially considering the decreasing value of the money for her. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is diminishing with each round. This offer is fair and prevents us from both losing out in the end.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth is pointless. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.  Every round is costing us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally offering a truly even split. While I held out for a slightly better deal in earlier rounds, accepting this offer now guarantees I get a reasonable share before inflation erodes the value further for Alice, making her less likely to offer a fair deal."
