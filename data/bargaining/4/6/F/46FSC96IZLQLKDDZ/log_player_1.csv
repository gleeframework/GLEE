  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40. We can negotiate from here.""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll have to be more aggressive with my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 57,
  ""bob_gain"": 43,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and the money's losing value fast. I'll give you 43, take 57. It's my best offer so far.""
