"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering to give Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a generous 40% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation rate.

After calculating the effective value of the money, I realize that Bob's offer is equivalent to:

Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.95^1 = 427,500
Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.80^1 = 440,000

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting less than 50% of the effective total. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm offering Bob 450,000 dollars, which is a more aggressive offer, but I think it's a good starting point for round 3."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money:

Alice gain: 500,000 * 0.85^3 = 368,625
Bob gain: 500,000 * 0.51^3 = 131,850

It looks like Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, but the effective values are quite different due to the inflation. I'll reject this offer since I'm getting less than 50% of the effective total.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 5, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which might seem like a fair offer, but considering the inflation, I'm actually giving up more value than Bob."
