"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, see how it goes""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, to set a baseline and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair for me to get a slightly bigger share since I'm taking the risk of rejection. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer is actually equivalent to 80% of the original amount, which is 8,000$. I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, giving Bob a bit more, but still keeping a slightly larger share for myself."
