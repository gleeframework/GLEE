Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's start fair! 50/50 seems like a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly higher split for myself, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. Inflation is working against me, so I need to secure a deal before it gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is making the money I get worth less and less. This offer is still not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing in the next round."
