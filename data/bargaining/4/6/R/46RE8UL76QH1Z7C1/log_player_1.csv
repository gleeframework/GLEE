"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair split, let's end it here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message suggesting we end the game here with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going all the way to a 50/50 split yet 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the terms, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, with a message suggesting we meet in the middle."
