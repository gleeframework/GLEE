}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message encouraging him to accept this as a fair starting point. Let's see what he says!"

# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor, and I'll keep the offer open for a couple of rounds.

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
