"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple proposal, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split. I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced share, but I'd rather not go to the next round if I can get a decent offer. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
