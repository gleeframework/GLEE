Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to reasonable, it's still advantageous for me to hold out.  Bob's value for the money is decreasing rapidly with each round, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal in future rounds."
