"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that the money will be worth less in future rounds.  This allows me to secure a larger portion of the money while still giving Bob a small incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting the 50/50 split is the best option.  The inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the next round.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise and secures me a substantial amount of the remaining value."
