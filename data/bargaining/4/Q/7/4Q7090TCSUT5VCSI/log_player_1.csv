"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 70/30 split. How about 55/45?  It's a more even distribution, and we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I think I can do better than 45$. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 45 is enough for me, Bob. Can you meet me at 50?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45, I'll try to counter with a slightly more aggressive offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, Bob, but I need a bigger share to account for inflation!""
}
```"
