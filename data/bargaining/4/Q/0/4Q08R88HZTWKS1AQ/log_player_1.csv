"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is making the money worth less and less. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I want to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, hoping to get a better deal than the previous offer."
