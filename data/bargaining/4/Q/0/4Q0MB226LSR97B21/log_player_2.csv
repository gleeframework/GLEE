Round 5

We're getting close to the wire, but I'm not going to cave just because of time pressure. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  Let's see if I can rattle her a bit in the next round."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, Bob. I'll take a bit more, thanks 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I have to be realistic. The value of the money is plummeting for me, and Alice knows she's got me over a barrel.  While I'd prefer a better split, accepting 44 now is better than risking getting a worse deal (or nothing at all) in the remaining rounds."
