"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more as I'm proposing first. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair enough, considering the significant amount of money involved. I believe I can propose a more balanced division. Let's see what happens in the next round!\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision and the updated values for the next round. I'll be happy to make a proposal then!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the first offer and the fact that money loses value over rounds.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made a counteroffer that slightly adjusts the proportions, taking into account the initial proposal and the impact of inflation on our decision-making process. Your turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the time pressure, Bob, but I need a slightly better deal than that.  This is a small increase for me, let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Considering the impact of inflation, I believe it's crucial to try and secure a better deal, even if it means proceeding to the next round. The difference in our proposed amounts is still relatively significant, and I'm not convinced that this is the most equitable division.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what the next round brings!\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make another offer. Given the decreasing value of money due to inflation, it's essential to find a mutually acceptable agreement quickly. My new proposal attempts to bridge the gap between our previous offers while considering the time pressure.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation now, let's meet closer to the middle to secure our gains.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
