"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value. I'll accept Bob's offer.
