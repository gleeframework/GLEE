"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll start by proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This way, both of us get a significant amount, and we can avoid further rounds that would reduce the value of the money due to inflation. I've included a message to Bob, suggesting that this is a reasonable and fair offer, in the hopes that he'll accept it and we can conclude the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split a bit more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept Bob's offer of a 45-55 split. Although the money's value has decreased by 10% for me, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Since Bob's gain isn't affected by inflation, he might be more willing to compromise to avoid losing the deal entirely. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll propose a 57-43 split in my favor. Considering the inflation, my goal is to find a mutually acceptable division that accounts for the decreasing value of the money for me. By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm attempting to find a compromise between our previous offers, hoping Bob will see this as a fair and reasonable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, this seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept Bob's offer of a 48-52 split. Although the money's value has decreased by 27.1% for me, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Since Bob's gain isn't affected by inflation, he might be more willing to compromise to avoid losing the deal entirely. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a more favorable division."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Getting closer, let's settle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Considering the increasing impact of inflation, my goal is to find a mutually acceptable division that accounts for the decreasing value of the money for me. By suggesting we're ""getting closer"" and that it's time to ""settle,"" I'm attempting to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept this offer, hoping he'll see this as a fair and reasonable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's make it a straight 50/50 split.  This ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation (40.95% less than the initial value), I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer. It's essential to consider that further rounds will only continue to reduce the value of the money for me, while Bob's gain remains unaffected. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount, and we can conclude the game before the inflation further erodes the value of the money.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
