"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the $100 evenly, I think it's a fair deal and there's no reason to reject it. Accepting this offer will give me $50, which is a good outcome. Rejecting it would mean proposing a different split in the next round, but there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer, and we might end up with a worse outcome or no deal at all. So, accepting this offer seems like the best decision."
