"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's take a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's being a bit greedy, isn't he?

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $8,000 is still a good chunk of change. But Bob's gain is now worth 10% less, so he's only getting $4,500 in real terms.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.
