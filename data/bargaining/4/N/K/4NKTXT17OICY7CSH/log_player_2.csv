Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the time constraint. While the inflation is hurting, accepting an unfair deal is worse than getting nothing. I need to hold my ground a bit longer and hope she gets more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be real.  The clock is ticking. I'm offering a fair 50/50 split.  Don't be greedy - let's both walk away with something substantial.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Time is running out, and Alice knows it. Offering a 50/50 split now emphasizes that we both lose out if this drags on. 
* **Fairness:**  While I'm losing value due to inflation, a 50/50 split is objectively fair from the initial starting point.  This might appeal to her sense of reason.
* **Direct Approach:** My previous messages haven't yielded results.  This one is direct and leaves no room for misinterpretation.  She either wants to win together or risk losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split isn't as fair as you think, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right. The inflation means a 50/50 split now isn't actually fair from my perspective.  She's consistently rejected offers that heavily favor me, and time is becoming a serious factor.  While $440,000 is less than I hoped for, it's significantly better than nothing, which is what we both get if we fail to reach an agreement."
