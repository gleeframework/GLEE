"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my gain of $70 in this round is worth 20% less than my gain of $60 in the first round, which is equivalent to $48. Bob's gain of $30 in this round is worth 10% less than his gain of $40 in the first round, which is equivalent to $36.

With this in mind, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair considering the effects of inflation."
