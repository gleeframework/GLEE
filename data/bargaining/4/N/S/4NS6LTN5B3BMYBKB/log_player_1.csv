"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the money. What do you say?""
}
```

This offer gives Bob 10% of the initial amount, which is $100,000. I'm hoping to get the majority of the money, but I'm also trying to be reasonable and give Bob a decent chunk to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly. It's fair and ensures both of us benefit equally. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, my gain of $500,000 in this round is actually worth 95% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's $475,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an even split, considering I'm getting a smaller amount due to inflation. I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure an even split is fair considering the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rate, my gain of $600,000 in this round is actually worth 95% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's $570,000.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and tries to get a bit more than the even split:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I'm still hoping to get the majority of the money. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I suggest we divide the money in a 45:55 ratio, reflecting a compromise between fairness and maximizing my share. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $550,000 in this round is worth 86.67% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's approximately $866,670.

Bob's gain of $450,000 in this round is worth 45% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's $450,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 45:55 ratio, considering I'm getting a smaller amount due to inflation. I'd like to try to get a bit more.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rate, my gain of $700,000 in this round is actually worth 70% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's $700,000.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose dividing the money in a 40:60 ratio, aiming for a balance that respects the diminishing value of money due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $600,000 in this round is worth 60% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's $600,000.

Bob's gain of $400,000 in this round is worth 40% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's $400,000.

A 40:60 ratio seems reasonable, considering the inflation. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and get a decent share of the money.

  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, a 40:60 ratio seems fair. I'll accept your offer.""
