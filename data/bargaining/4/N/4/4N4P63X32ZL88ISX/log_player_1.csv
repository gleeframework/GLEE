I propose to take 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, as I get the majority but I still offer Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm going to try to get a bit more this time, but I'm still willing to compromise.  Since Bob took a big chunk in the last round, I'm going to offer him 30 dollars and take 70 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair deal considering the inflation and the fact that the next round could see me getting less.  I'll take the 50/50 split."
