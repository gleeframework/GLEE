Let's see if Bob is greedy or not! ðŸ˜‰  I'm keeping the majority but I'm willing to share a small amount to get this done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred to get more, a 50/50 split is still a good deal considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
