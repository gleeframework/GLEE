"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money is worth the same for me (Bob) as it was in the first round, but for Alice, it's worth 36% less than in the first round due to inflation.

### Step 2: Analyze previous offers and outcomes
In Round 1, Alice offered 40 to me and 60 to herself, which I rejected. In Round 2, I offered 55 to myself and 45 to Alice, which she rejected. In Round 3, Alice offered 45 to me and 55 to herself, which I again rejected.

### Step 3: Consider the impact of inflation on Alice's gain
Since the money is worth 36% less for Alice than in the first round, she is under pressure to settle the deal as soon as possible to minimize her losses due to inflation.

### Step 4: Determine my next offer
Given the pressure on Alice due to inflation, I should try to take advantage of this situation by offering her a slightly worse deal than before, while still being reasonable enough that she might accept it to avoid further losses.

### Step 5: Decide on the specific offer and message
I will offer 58 to myself and 42 to Alice, with a message explaining that I'm aware of the impact of inflation on her gain and that this offer is a compromise considering the current situation.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair compromise""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm losing a lot to inflation.  Take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 6 of the game. The money is still worth the same for me (Bob) as it was in the first round, but for Alice, it's now worth 59.04% less than in the first round due to inflation. This means Alice is under even more pressure to settle the deal quickly.

### Step 2: Analyze previous offers and outcomes
In the previous rounds, both Alice and I have made offers that the other party has rejected. Alice's last offer was 48 for me and 52 for herself, which I rejected.

### Step 3: Consider the impact of inflation on Alice's gain
Given the significant decrease in value for Alice, she is highly motivated to end the game as soon as possible to avoid further losses.

### Step 4: Determine my next offer
Since Alice is under a lot of pressure due to inflation, I can try to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself than before, but still within a range that Alice might consider acceptable given her rapidly decreasing potential gains.

### Step 5: Decide on the specific offer and message
I will offer 60 to myself and 40 to Alice, with a message acknowledging the pressure she's under due to inflation and suggesting this as a final compromise.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your potential gain, I believe this is a reasonable final offer.""}"
