Round 37
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alice, at this point, is being incredibly stubborn. She's likely to continue rejecting offers, hoping to get the vast majority of the money. However, this strategy is risky. It's possible Bob will get tired of this game and just walk away, leaving Alice with nothing.  

Given that she has already rejected so many offers, it's time for her to show a little flexibility. Here's her offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 999980, ""bob_gain"": 20}
``` 

This offer is a bit more generous than her previous ones, but still gives her a very large share of the money.  It's a chance to see if Bob will finally accept."

Round 39
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alice, you're playing a dangerous game!  You've rejected every offer, and now Bob is getting more and more frustrated. He might just walk away, leaving you with nothing. You need to be realistic and show that you're willing to compromise.  

This time, you need to make a **significant** change in your offer. Consider that Bob is offering you a pretty good deal, and if you keep rejecting it, he's likely to give up entirely.

Here's your offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 999900, ""bob_gain"": 100} 
```

This is a big concession, but it's necessary to salvage this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 39.

Round 40
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice, at this point, is in a very difficult position. She has stubbornly refused to budge from her demand for the majority of the money. Bob has also proven to be stubborn. Both are playing a risky game. The longer this goes on, the greater the chance that one of them will walk away, leaving the other with nothing.

It's clear that Alice's strategy of holding out for the vast majority of the money has failed. Bob is clearly not going to back down.  Alice needs to accept this offer and end the game.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

If Alice continues to reject, it is very likely Bob will get tired of this game and walk away, leaving Alice with nothing."
