"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to get a larger share of the remaining amount. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to 20% inflation in two rounds. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This way, I'll get a larger share of the remaining amount, considering the decreased value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Considering the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to get a larger share of the remaining amount. However, Bob's offer is close to the ratio of the remaining amount, so I'll consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer.
