"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about it.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $4,000 when I was initially looking for a more equitable split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not being too generous""}

I'm proposing a slightly more uneven split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and not being too generous, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll still try to get more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting even more one-sided! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting really worried about the value of the money.

After careful consideration, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $3,000 when the value of the money is decreasing so rapidly. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm getting serious, it's time to make a deal""}

I'm proposing a more aggressive split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money and make a more assertive move to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wow, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly! Bob's offer is getting more and more one-sided, and I'm getting desperate.

After careful consideration, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $2,000 when the value of the money is decreasing so rapidly. I'll try to make another aggressive offer in the next round to try to get a better deal.

At this point, I'm starting to get worried that we might not be able to divide the money fairly, and I'm considering making a more extreme offer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I need to try to get a better deal""}

I'm proposing a highly aggressive split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I'm taking a risk by making such an extreme offer, but I'm desperate to get a better deal given the rapid decrease in the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need to take what I can now 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly! Bob's offer is getting more and more one-sided, and I'm running out of options.

After careful consideration, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $1,000 when the value of the money is decreasing so rapidly. I'll try to make one more offer in the next round to try to get a better deal, but I'm getting desperate.

At this point, I'm starting to think that we might not be able to divide the money fairly, and I'm considering accepting a very bad deal just to get something."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 1000, ""bob_gain"": 9000, ""message"": ""I'll take whatever I can get, I'm running out of options""}

I'm proposing a very bad deal, with me getting only $1,000 and Bob getting $9,000. I'm desperate to get something, even if it's a terrible deal. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not sure if he will.

At this point, I'm willing to accept a very bad deal just to get something, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly and I'm running out of options."
