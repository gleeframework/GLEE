"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for a large share, but I'm also offering Bob something to incentivize him to accept. Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm going to reject it.  He's offering me much less than I was willing to give him in the first round, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I get to make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm taking a smaller share than in the first round, but this is to account for inflation. I'm offering Bob a bit more than he offered me, hoping this will be enough to persuade him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I offered him in the third round, and with the inflation, my share is much smaller. At this point, I'm better off accepting and moving on."
