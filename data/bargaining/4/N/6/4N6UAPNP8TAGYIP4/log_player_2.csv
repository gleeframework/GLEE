# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can do better than that. With 11 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try and get a more favorable offer. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me, but still reasonable for Alice. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll take that into account.
