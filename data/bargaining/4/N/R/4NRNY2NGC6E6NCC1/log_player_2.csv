"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob.  I'm happy to take a bit less to get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I'm hoping for a slightly more even split.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's aim for a slightly closer split this time.  We both know the money is losing value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a more even split, the declining value of the money makes this a reasonable compromise."
