Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering I'm taking on more risk by rejecting your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable and split it evenly this time. Inflation is affecting us both, and I don't want to keep going back and forth.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risks I'm taking by rejecting your previous offers. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the offer is worse than the previous round, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting. 
The inflation means the money I'm gaining is worth less and less, and I'm not sure how much longer the game will go on. 
It's better to take the deal now and avoid any further potential losses."
