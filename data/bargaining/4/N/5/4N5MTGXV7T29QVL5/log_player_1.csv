"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair offer, giving Bob a slightly smaller share. I'm hoping he'll accept it, but I'm ready to negotiate if he wants to keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a much worse offer than my original proposal. Even with the inflation, I think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly to account for the inflation. This offer still gives me a majority of the money, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise."
