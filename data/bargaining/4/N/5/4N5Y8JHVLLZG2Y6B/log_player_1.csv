"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. I reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
