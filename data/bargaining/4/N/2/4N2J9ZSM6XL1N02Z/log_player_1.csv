"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money but leaves Bob with something.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, as he'll get a small amount but avoid getting nothing at all if we keep going and inflation hits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm losing nothing to inflation. While this offer gives me a larger amount than his previous offer,  I'm still losing out on a significant amount of money. I'll reject this and push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a bit more than before, but still keep a large majority for myself. I'm hoping this will be enough to tempt him into accepting, especially since he's losing a significant amount of his potential gains due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering me more than in the previous round,  his gains are still worth significantly less due to inflation.  I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in the next round, as the pressure will be on Bob to accept before he loses even more money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still maintain a substantial majority for myself.  This is a compromise, aiming to balance my desire for a larger portion with the need to convince Bob to accept before the inflation completely devalues his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with an even split, this is a good deal for me. Bob's offer is worth significantly less to him due to the heavy inflation, and there's no guarantee he'll offer me more in the next round. It's time to secure a deal before we both lose more money."
