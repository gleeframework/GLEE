"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $100 in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $25. This seems fair considering the decreasing value of money in each round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. It's a fair and simple division, and we can avoid the decreasing value of money for now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
