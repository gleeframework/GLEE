"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100, and we can finish the game in one round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for his next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value to me. Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more favorable share to Bob, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
