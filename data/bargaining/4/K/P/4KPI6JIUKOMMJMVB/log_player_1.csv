Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to get a larger portion for myself as well. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Alice. Waiting any longer will result in a much smaller gain, even if she manages to secure a slightly better deal in a future round.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently rejected Alice's offers, indicating he's likely aiming for a larger share. It's unlikely he'll drastically change his stance in the next round. 

Accepting the $400,000 now avoids the risk of getting an even lower amount later, which is the more rational choice despite the apparent unfairness."
