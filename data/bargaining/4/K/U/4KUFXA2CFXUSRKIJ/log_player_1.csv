Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly!""}\n\nHow's that? I offered Bob $4,000 and I get $6,000, with a friendly message to set a positive tone. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it a bit closer to the middle this time. I'm confident we can reach a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer, as I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The 10% inflation is a consideration, but I'm willing to take the risk to try and get a more favorable split. Let's see what happens next!"

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise!"
