Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but the longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle with a 55/45 split. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
