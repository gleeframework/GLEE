"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I propose to take 990,000 dollars and give Bob 10,000 dollars.  This seems fair since I am the one taking the risk of being rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
``` 

I'm taking a slightly smaller share this time, as I'm losing 5% per round and need to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing a substantial amount due to inflation, I'm unlikely to get a better deal if I reject. It's better to take what I can get at this point."
