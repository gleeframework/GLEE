Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the deal still isn't favorable enough considering the faster rate of inflation affecting my potential gains.  It's worth risking another round to aim for a larger share.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This offer is fair and ensures we both benefit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** With each round, the potential winnings decrease. It's becoming crucial to strike a deal soon.
* **Balancing act:** While I aimed higher last round, Alice's counter-offer suggests she's willing to negotiate. This offer is a compromise, still favoring me slightly but likely within a range she'll consider. 
* **Clear communication:** The message emphasizes the time sensitivity and presents the offer as a mutually beneficial solution."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting us both, let's split the difference. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning. 

* **Inflation impact:**  My potential gains are decreasing at a much faster rate than Alice's. Holding out for a significantly better deal in later rounds is becoming increasingly risky.
* **Alice's offer:**  While not ideal, her offer is now closer to a 50/50 split. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and further rounds mean smaller potential gains for both of us.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, whereas rejecting risks getting a worse deal or even reaching a point where the remaining value isn't worth negotiating over."
