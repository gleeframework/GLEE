"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, I'll give you a good start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share now, but I'm still getting a good chunk, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to be more cautious. But 200,000 is still a decent amount. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the next round, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, take it or leave it""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting any more generous, so I'll try to be more realistic 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be very careful. 400,000 is a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, hoping that Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 60.16% less than in the first round now. I'll try to be more aggressive and make a strong offer to try to end the game.

  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or walk away""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit more generous, but I'll try to squeeze a bit more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round now, which means the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be very careful with my decisions.

I'm not sure if 300,000 is enough, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that 300,000 is a fair deal considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
