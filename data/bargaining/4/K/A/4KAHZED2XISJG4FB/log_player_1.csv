"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 4000, let's start with a fair split!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, let's make it worth your while! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 gain from the first round is now worth $5,400.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting $3,000, which is a smaller share than I initially proposed. However, it's still a decent offer, and I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round.

I'll decide to accept this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
