"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll get $9,500 (80% of $10,000) and Bob will get $9,500 as well. Bob's offer is actually a 50/50 split, which is a better deal for me than my initial offer. I accept this offer.
