I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't let him!  I'm still holding out for a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm offering a slightly smaller share than my first offer, but still a significant one, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 481600 
# Bob gain: 518400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, and the inflation is becoming a bigger risk for me. It's time to take a good chunk of money and move on."
