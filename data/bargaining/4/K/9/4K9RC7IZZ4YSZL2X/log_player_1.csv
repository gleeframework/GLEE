"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $60 for herself and give $40 to Bob, with a message suggesting that her getting a bit more is a fair division. The total amount of money is worth $100 at this point. Bob will now have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time, with a slight advantage to me to compensate for the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice rejects Bob's offer, choosing to proceed to the next round where she will make a new proposal. Despite the inflation reducing the value of her potential gain, she is not satisfied with the division proposed by Bob. The game will continue with Alice making a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $57 for herself and give $43 to Bob, with a message emphasizing that considering the inflation that has reduced the value of her gain, this division is more than fair. The total amount of money remains at $100 for Bob, but due to inflation, Alice's potential gain is worth less to her than it would have been in the initial round. Bob will now have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
