"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a bit more fair. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45/55 split, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round (80% of 80% = 64% of the original value), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split?""
}
```

I'm suggesting a 50/50 split, hoping to find a middle ground and end the game quickly."
