"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn.  Let's be practical, this round it is 70/30 or next round the pot shrinks significantly. ""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The pot is shrinking, Bob. Let's be reasonable and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit on inflation.  Take 40 now, or watch the pot shrink further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last offer, Bob. This is a one-time deal before the value drops further for you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Value:**  The money is rapidly losing value for Bob due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Strong Position:** Alice knows Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation. She's unlikely to offer anything better, especially since this is her ""last offer.""
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While 30 is significantly less than what Bob aimed for initially, it's still better than going another round and potentially getting an even lower offer or reaching a point where the deal is incredibly unfavorable."
