Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn.  Let's be practical, this round it is 70/30 or next round the pot shrinks significantly.  
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit on inflation.  Take 40 now, or watch the pot shrink further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offer is still not good enough. While he's experiencing the pain of inflation more acutely, holding out means I'm likely to secure an even better deal in the next round."
