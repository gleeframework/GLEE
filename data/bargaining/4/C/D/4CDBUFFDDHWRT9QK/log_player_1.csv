"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer, suggesting a 50/50 split. Let's see if Bob accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreased value of Bob's offer.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount, hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger hit on Bob's offer, I'm not as eager to accept this offer as I was in the previous rounds. However, I still think 450,000 is a decent amount, and it's better than what I could get from the previous offer.

I'll accept this offer.
