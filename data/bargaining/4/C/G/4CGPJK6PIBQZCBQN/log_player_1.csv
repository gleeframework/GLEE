"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I think this is a fair starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more equitable, I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I do appreciate Bob's willingness to compromise. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Let's see how things go from here.
