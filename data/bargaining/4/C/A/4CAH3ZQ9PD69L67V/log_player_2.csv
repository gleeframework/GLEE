"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  It's a good start, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer, but since it's not my turn yet, I'll just reject this one. 10% seems a bit low, considering we're starting with a large sum of money. Let's see what happens next!"
