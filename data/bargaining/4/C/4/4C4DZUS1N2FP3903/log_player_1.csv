"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a generous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'll have to think carefully before making a decision. Since the offer is not very favorable to me, I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The game is heating up!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer. While it's still not great for me, it's getting closer to the end of the game and I don't want to risk getting nothing.
