"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is worth less for both players.
* **Alice's Offer:** While Alice gets a slightly larger share, it's important to remember that your gain is worth *36%* less than the first round. Taking a smaller share now is better than risking a worse outcome in the next round. 
* **Risk:**  If you reject, there's no guarantee Alice will offer you a better deal in the next round. She might even offer you a smaller share due to inflation. 

**It's better to secure some money now, even if it's less than your initial target, than risk getting nothing.**"
