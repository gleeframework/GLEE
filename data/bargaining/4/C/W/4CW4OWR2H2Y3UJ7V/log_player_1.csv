Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob presents his offer as ""generous,"" it's heavily skewed in his favor. The inflation works in my favor over time, so holding out for a better deal in the next round is the smarter move."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm aiming for a fairer split, Bob.  Consider the impact of inflation on your share if you refuse.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:** I'm reducing my demand from the initial 70/30 split to show a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting inflation:** Reminding Bob of the rapid devaluation of his share might push him to accept a deal sooner. 
* **Aiming for a strong position:** By round 3, the devaluation is significant. If he rejects this offer, I'll be in a very strong position in Round 4 as the money continues to lose value, particularly for Bob."
