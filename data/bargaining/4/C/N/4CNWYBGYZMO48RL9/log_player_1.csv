"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better.  I'll take 60% and leave you 40%.  This is a fair offer given the declining value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'll accept Bob's offer. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will make a new offer, and I'll have a chance to negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less than in Round 1, and Bob's offer having been rejected, I'll try to make a new proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 40%. This is my revised offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still leaving room for negotiation."
