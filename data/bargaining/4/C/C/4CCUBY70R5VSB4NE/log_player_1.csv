"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to try and get the majority of the money, but I'm also aware that Bob might reject this and get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. Even though I'm losing 10% of my earnings each round, I can still make a higher profit by rejecting and proposing a new division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to try and increase my share again, but since I'm the one proposing this time, I have to offer Bob at least something more than he got in the last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I will accept this offer. Although the inflation has significantly reduced my earnings, I will end up getting more money than if I reject the offer and go to the next round. There's no guarantee I can get a better deal, and with the inflation, I risk getting less in the end."
