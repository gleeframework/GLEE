"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll calculate my gain in terms of the first-round value. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 4000/0.8 = 5000 in the first-round value, which is less than my initial offer of 6000. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value in the third round (0.8^2), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the current value of the money, which is equivalent to 32% of the original $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 51.2% of its original value in the fourth round (0.8^3), I'll calculate my gain in terms of the first-round value. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 4500/0.512 = 8796.875 in the first-round value, which is more than my previous offer of 8000. I'll accept this offer.
