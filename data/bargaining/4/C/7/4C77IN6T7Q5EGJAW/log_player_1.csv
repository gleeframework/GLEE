"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since we're both starting out, I think it's reasonable to take the larger share.  However, I am open to negotiation and will consider Bob's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation factor makes this offer more appealing.  Accepting this means I get to keep at least something, while rejecting it could lead to nothing in the next round."
