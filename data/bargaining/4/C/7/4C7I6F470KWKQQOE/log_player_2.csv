I'm Bob, and I want to try to get a better deal!  Let's see what I can negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I'm going to offer Alice a slightly better deal than she offered me, but still keep a larger share. Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, inflation is a serious factor now. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
