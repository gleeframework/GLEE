"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob! I think we can both live with this.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'll try to counter with a slightly better one for me! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's counteroffer is a bit more aggressive than I expected, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his gain of $700,000 is actually equivalent to $560,000 in the first round's value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up that much to Bob just yet. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where both of us can be happy with the split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still too generous, I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting! Bob's gain of $550,000 is actually equivalent to $408,000 in the first round's value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up that much more to Bob. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob! It's only fair, and we can both walk away happy.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a fair and equal split, and I think 50/50 is a reasonable compromise."
