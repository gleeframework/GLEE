"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate you trying to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to give you a larger share this time, but I need a bit more than 4000. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's still tilted in her favor, especially considering the rapid inflation affecting her gains more severely.  I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
