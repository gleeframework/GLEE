Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll adjust my offer, but I'm not going to get much less.  This is a fair deal given the time constraints. Accept this or we risk losing it all. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving in the right direction, she's still heavily favoring herself considering the rapid depreciation of her share. It's too early to settle for 30%. I need to signal I'm willing to risk it for a better deal."

{

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is a 50/50 split. Accept this, or we'll both get nothing. It's the only way to save something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this late stage. 

* **Time Pressure:**  We are at round 5 with 7 rounds remaining.  Waiting any longer drastically increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her offer is now based on a sense of urgency and fairness. It's unlikely she'll go lower given her previous offers and the shrinking pot. 

A 50/50 split guarantees a reasonable payout considering the circumstances."
