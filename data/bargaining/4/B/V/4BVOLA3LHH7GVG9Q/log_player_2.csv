"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only 10% of the total amount. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'd like to make a proposal to Alice. My message is: ""Let's split it down the middle for real this time."" My proposed division is 5000 for me and 5000 for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle for real this time.""}\n\nPlease let me know if Alice accepts this offer or decides to proceed to the next round. Keep in mind that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases by 10% for me, so I'm hoping Alice will accept this fair offer."
