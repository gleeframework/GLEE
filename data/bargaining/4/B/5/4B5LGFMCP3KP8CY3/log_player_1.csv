Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation.

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to compensate for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and the value of his potential gains is plummeting. While his offer isn't terrible in the face of the inflation he's experiencing, I'm betting I can get him to offer at least 4000 in the next couple of rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm running out of time. This is my final offer, take it or we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a high-stakes gamble. Bob is clearly desperate, and his offer is heavily skewed in his favor. However, I'm betting that he's bluffing about this being his final offer. The value of his potential 8000 is now worth significantly less than my 2000. I think he'll be forced to give me a better offer in the next round to avoid getting nothing."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I'm feeling generous.  This is my final offer. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to start pushing a bit harder. I'm offering a slightly smaller amount to myself but phrasing it as a ""generous"" offer and my ""final"" one.  This creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he needs to take the deal before it's off the table.  He's likely to cave, especially since the value of his potential gain is rapidly decreasing."
