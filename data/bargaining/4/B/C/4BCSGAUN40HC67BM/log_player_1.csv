"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, let's take a bit more for myself this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. My gain of $5,000 is worth 5% less than my initial offer of $6,000, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 20% less than his initial offer of $4,000. This means I'm essentially losing value compared to the first round, while Bob is gaining more. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take $5,500, which is a bit more than my initial offer, but still leaves $4,500 for Bob. This way, I'm trying to account for the inflation and make a slightly more favorable deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation even more!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this is a good deal for me. My gain of $4,500 is worth 25.5% less than my initial offer of $6,000, and Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 37.5% less than his initial offer of $4,000.

  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to make it worth my while. Let's try to find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take $5,800, which is a bit more than my previous offers, and leaving $4,200 for Bob. I'm trying to find a balance that takes into account the ongoing inflation and gives me a slightly better deal."
