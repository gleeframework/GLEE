I propose that I take $990,000, and Bob gets $10,000.  This seems like a fair starting point considering the money is worth less each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can do better!  I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to try a more even split this time.  I'll take $800,000 and leave Bob with $200,000.  Hopefully, this is more appealing than his last offer."
