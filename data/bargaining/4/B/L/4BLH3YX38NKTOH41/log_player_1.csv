"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000, with the message ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable."" This division gives me a slightly larger share, considering that with each round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for Bob than for me. The message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and prompt a quick resolution to maximize the value we both receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more fair split, considering the potential for inflation in the next rounds. Let's work together to make the most of this opportunity. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, accepting 40% of the money in the second round would be less beneficial for me compared to potentially getting a better offer in the next rounds or proposing a division more favorable to me. The inflation rates indicate that Bob is under more pressure to settle quickly, which I can leverage in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $5,800 and Bob receives $4,200, with the message ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground."" Given the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, finding a compromise that is closer to the original offer but still acknowledges the devaluation of the money over time seems like a reasonable approach to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This also takes into account Bob's previous counteroffer and aims to meet somewhere in the middle, while still favoring my position slightly due to the less severe impact of inflation on my potential gain."
