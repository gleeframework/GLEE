"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can both do better. This offer is a 60/40 split in my favor, which reflects the difference in our inflation rates. Let's agree now to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is simply a reversal of my initial proposal, taking advantage of the inflation difference. While the longer the game goes on, the more we both lose, it's better for me to hold out for a more balanced deal. There's a chance Bob will propose a more equitable split in the next round to avoid further losses from inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want to settle this quickly. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This recognizes the impact of inflation on both our ends while still offering you a sizable portion. Let's be reasonable and wrap this up.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Inflation:** This offer takes into account the increasing impact of inflation on both sides. 
* **Compromise:** While still favoring Alice, it's a significant compromise from her initial 60/40 proposal. 
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the need for a swift resolution to minimize further losses from inflation. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a reasonable advantage for Alice while also being appealing enough for Bob to accept and avoid further devaluation of their potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is closer to my previous offer and still recognizes the inflation we're both experiencing. Let's end this stalemate and settle on a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is now closer to a 50/50 split after factoring in the significant inflation we've both experienced.  

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to reject offers in the hope of gaining a slight advantage is becoming increasingly risky. The longer the game goes on, the more our potential gains shrink.
* **Potential for Loss:** If I reject this offer and Bob becomes more aggressive in the next round, I risk ending up with an even less favorable outcome. 

It's better to accept a slightly less advantageous offer now than to risk losing even more to the relentless march of inflation."
