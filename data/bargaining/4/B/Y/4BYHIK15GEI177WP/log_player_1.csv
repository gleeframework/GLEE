"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can split the remaining $100,000 in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, I'm giving Bob a decent amount to start with, and we can negotiate further in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous, Alice! Let's start with a fair split 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants a more even split.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $250,000 and Bob will take $750,000. This way, we can move on to the next round and continue negotiating."
