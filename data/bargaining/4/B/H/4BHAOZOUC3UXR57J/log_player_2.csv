"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split things a bit more evenly this time, Alice. Remember, time is money!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob, but so is inflation for you. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is now better than what I can expect in future rounds. If I reject, I risk getting even less in round 4 due to inflation.
