Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a slightly larger share this round, as the value of the money decreases faster for you. But I'm open to negotiation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

I'll take a slightly smaller share than my initial offer - $5,500 for me, $4,500 for you.  This ensures we both get a reasonable amount before the value decreases further.""
