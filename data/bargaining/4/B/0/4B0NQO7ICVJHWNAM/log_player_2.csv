"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split. I take $6,000, you take $4,000. It's better to secure a deal now as the value decreases over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm going to take a slightly larger share this round, as the value of the money decreases faster for you. But I'm open to negotiation in future rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your last offer wasn't fair given the inflation rates.  Let's settle this. I'll take a slightly smaller share than my initial offer - $5,500 for me, $4,500 for you.  This ensures we both get a reasonable amount before the value decreases further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
