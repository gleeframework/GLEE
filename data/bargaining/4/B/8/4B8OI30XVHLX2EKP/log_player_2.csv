"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice, the total amount is now $8,000 for me and $9,000 for Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less for me and 19% less for Alice, the total amount is now $6,400 for me and $7,800 for Alice.

However, considering the original offer I made in round 2 was 6000 for me and 4000 for Alice, this new offer is actually worse for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less for me and 19% less for Alice, the total amount is now $6,400 for me and $7,800 for Alice.

However, I'll try to make a better offer this time.
