"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose to take $55 and give Bob $45.  This seems like a fair starting point given we both have equal power in this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair offer, and given the inflation, I'm likely to get a worse deal if I reject and Bob makes a proposal in round 3."
