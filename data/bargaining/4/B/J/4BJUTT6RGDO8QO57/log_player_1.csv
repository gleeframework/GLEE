Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but I'm also playing to win.  Let's start fair, and if we both keep playing reasonably, we can both walk away with a decent chunk of the money.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This is a fair split, and if we keep playing, the money will only shrink for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still a significant loss for me.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal. The inflation factor makes it more likely that Bob will be more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
