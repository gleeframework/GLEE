"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a little less than half to account for the time value of money.""
}
``` 

This offer is strategically designed for a few reasons:

* **Acknowledges Inflation:**  It directly addresses the inflation mechanic, making it clear to Bob that Alice is aware of the decreasing value of the money over time. 
* **Appears Fair (Slightly):** By offering slightly more than half, it might initially seem like Alice is being generous to Bob. 
* **Maximizes Early Gains:** Accepting now gets Bob a reasonable sum immediately. If he waits, there's a chance he might get a smaller amount later.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand about the time value of money, Alice, but I think it's fairer if we switch amounts from your last offer. This way, I'm slightly incentivized to close the deal now, and you still get a good deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but it would be a mistake to accept. Here's why:

* **Shift in Power:** Bob is now aware that Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation.  This gives him a negotiating advantage.
* **Unfavorable Trend:** Accepting this offer means Alice is immediately agreeing to a worse deal than her initial proposal. This sets a bad precedent for future rounds.

By rejecting, Alice signals she's willing to negotiate but won't be pushed into a corner. The inflation factor works both ways; if Bob is too greedy, he risks getting a smaller share later."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be realistic.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to settle this.  Every round that passes hurts us both in the long run."" 
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Direct and Firm:** The message is direct, conveying a sense of urgency. 
* **Appeals to Logic:**  By emphasizing the ""long run"" impact of inflation, Alice subtly reminds Bob that being stubborn hurts them both.
* **Strong Position:** Offering a 50/50 split after rejecting Bob's previous offer puts Alice in a stronger negotiating position. It shows she's willing to be fair but won't be taken advantage of.

This offer increases the pressure on Bob to accept a reasonable deal before inflation erodes the value further."
