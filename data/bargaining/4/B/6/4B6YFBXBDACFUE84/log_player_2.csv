"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that. This offer reflects the value decrease, but gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although it's not a perfect split, accepting this offer makes the most sense for Bob at this stage:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. Delaying further significantly hurts both players.
* **Fairness:** While Alice still gets a slightly larger share, the gap has narrowed considerably from her initial offer. This offer is much closer to a 50/50 split after accounting for inflation.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will propose anything better in subsequent rounds. In fact, her offers might become less favorable as the money continues to lose value.

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting even less later."
