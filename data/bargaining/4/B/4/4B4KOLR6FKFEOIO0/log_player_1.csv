Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we should aim for a 50/50 split.  We're both losing money with every round.  Let's be reasonable and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

This is a classic example of the Ultimatum Game with the added pressure of inflation.  While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount in future rounds, accepting a 50/50 split now makes the most sense:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value decreases significantly. Waiting any longer risks a much smaller payout for both of us.
* **Fairness:** Bob's offer is fair, and pushing for a larger share when he seems set on a 50/50 split might make him dig in his heels, leading to a worse outcome. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout. Rejecting introduces uncertainty and the risk of walking away with nothing."
