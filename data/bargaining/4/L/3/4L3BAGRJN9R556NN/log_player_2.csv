Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 350k.  This offer is fair given the inflation.  Accept and we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering more, accepting now would still give her the majority of the money. Since I'm being hit harder by inflation, holding out for a better deal in the next few rounds is crucial.  The goal is to reach a more equitable split before the inflation significantly devalues my potential earnings."
