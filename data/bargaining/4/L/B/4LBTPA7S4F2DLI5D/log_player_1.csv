"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount. I think this is a reasonable offer, considering that the money doesn't lose value for me, but it does for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer this way.  Let's split it evenly in the next round if you don't agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6100,
  ""bob_gain"": 3900,
  ""message"": ""You said you'd split evenly, but I don't think that's necessary""
}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but not by much. Since Bob's money is worth 10% less now (5% less in each of the two rounds), I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept a slightly worse offer."

  ""alice_gain"": 6200,
  ""bob_gain"": 3800,
  ""message"": ""Your 'fair' split isn't so fair considering inflation""
}

I'm increasing my offer again, but still taking advantage of the fact that Bob's money is worth less and less with each round. I'm hoping he'll eventually accept one of my offers."

  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, inflation is on my side""
}

I'm making a slightly better offer, but still taking advantage of the fact that Bob's money is worth less and less with each round. I'm hoping he'll eventually accept one of my offers, as the inflation is putting pressure on him to settle."
