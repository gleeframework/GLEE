"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This way, we both get a fair share without having to haggle. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still want a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on our earnings.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money worth 5% less, $4,000 is equivalent to $4,000 / 0.95 = $4,210.53 in the original amount. Similarly, $6,000 is equivalent to $6,000 / 0.95 = $6,315.79.

While Bob's offer is still slightly biased towards him, I think I can live with it. I'll accept his offer.
