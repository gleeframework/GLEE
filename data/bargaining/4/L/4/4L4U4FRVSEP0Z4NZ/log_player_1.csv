"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, giving myself a larger share.  This is a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair offer, and I'd rather take that than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
