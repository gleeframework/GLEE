Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll offer a slightly more favorable deal to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of money for me and Alice, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since my gain is now worth 9.75% less than the original, I'd like a slightly more favorable deal. But considering the reduced value of money for Alice, I think this offer is acceptable.
