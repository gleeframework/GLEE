"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40% or $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the offer, but I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less now, I'm looking for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a better split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45% or $45."
