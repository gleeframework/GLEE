"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a bigger share, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping Bob will make a more balanced offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit one-sided, I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob! I'm not thrilled about the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's share is decreasing due to inflation. However, I'm willing to consider his compromise.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's getting closer to a 50/50 split. I'm hoping that Bob will be satisfied with this outcome and we can wrap up the game."
