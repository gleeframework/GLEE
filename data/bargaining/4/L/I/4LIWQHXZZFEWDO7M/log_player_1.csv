**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation Impact:**  The inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me. This makes him increasingly desperate, and he's unlikely to offer me a better deal in the future. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** If I reject this offer, the value of the money will decrease even further in the next round. Even if I could secure a slightly better split in Round 5, the actual value I receive would likely be less than what Bob is offering now. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the game is a gamble. There's no guarantee I can get Bob to agree to a significantly better offer, and each round brings the risk of getting a much worse deal due to the inflation.

It's painful to see the initial offer slip away, but taking the sure bet in Round 4 makes the most sense given the circumstances."
