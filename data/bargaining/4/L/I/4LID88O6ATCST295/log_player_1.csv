"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly and avoid inflation losses""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money and leave 45% for Bob. I've included a message to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game early, avoiding the inflation losses that will occur in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get more this way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Although the offer seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and I expect to get a better deal than an even split, I will reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the inflation""
}
```

In this round, I've increased my share to 58%, considering that the money is worth less due to inflation. I'm still leaving a reasonable amount for Bob, but I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to him due to the higher inflation rate on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's avoid further inflation losses. This is a fair split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant inflation losses, especially on Bob's side, I think this offer is reasonable. The split is the same as my initial offer, but due to the inflation, the actual value is lower. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses."
