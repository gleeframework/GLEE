"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. Considering the new values, I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll accept it for now.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
