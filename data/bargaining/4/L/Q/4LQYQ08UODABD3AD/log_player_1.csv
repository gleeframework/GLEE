This is my offer, Alice. I'm giving you the lion's share because we're both starting out fresh and I'm hoping for a fair and friendly division. I believe this sets a good precedent for future rounds. What do you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
``` 

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, Bob. I believe this is fair, as we're both experiencing inflation.  Let's aim for a resolution in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting worse due to inflation, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low share. I'll continue to negotiate for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, Bob, but still offering a significant portion to you. Remember, inflation is biting into your gains, and we're running out of time. Let's find a compromise before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still less than what I initially wanted, inflation is significantly impacting him, and it's becoming risky to keep rejecting. Accepting a 50/50 split is the most sensible choice at this point, considering the dwindling time and the value of the money."
