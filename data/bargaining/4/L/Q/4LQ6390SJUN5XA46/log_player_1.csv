"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm still holding out for more! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll try to negotiate further in the next round. For now, I'll take the $3,000 and hope to do better in the next round.
