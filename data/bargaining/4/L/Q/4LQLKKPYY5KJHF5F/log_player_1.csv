"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 equally between us, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $32.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I think I'll accept it for now. It's a decent offer, and I'd rather get something than nothing.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
