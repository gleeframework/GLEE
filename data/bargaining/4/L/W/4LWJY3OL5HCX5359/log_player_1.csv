"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm starting with a fair split to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'm starting low. Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than the previous round, so I'll have to adjust my calculations.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
