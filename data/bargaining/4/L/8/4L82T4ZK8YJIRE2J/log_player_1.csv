"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 6,000 and Bob will take 4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I can do better. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to do better in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
