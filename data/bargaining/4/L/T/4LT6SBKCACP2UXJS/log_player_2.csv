This is a very uneven split in Alice's favor.  It's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the money is worth less for both of us, this is a much better deal for me than the previous round.  It's likely Alice is going to continue pushing for more in the following rounds, so it's best to take this while I can."
