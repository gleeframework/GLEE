"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and get this money while it's worth something, Bob. I take 60%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I need to look out for myself too. This offer ensures we both benefit.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value fast. It's in Bob's best interest to settle this round, as his share will decrease more rapidly than Alice's in subsequent rounds.
* **Strategic Counter:** Alice's 60/40 split was ambitious. Offering 52/48 is a more balanced counter-proposal. It gives Bob slightly more than a 50/50 split, acknowledging the faster inflation he faces. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message aims to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness while highlighting the urgency due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal than last round for both of us, considering the inflation. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Pressure:** The inflation is significantly impacting potential gains. Waiting longer means a smaller pie for both of us.
* **Improved Offer:** Alice's offer is better than her previous 60/40 split. While not ideal, securing 45% now is better than risking even less in subsequent rounds. 
* **Time Value:**  The longer the game goes on, the more Bob loses due to the faster rate of inflation he faces. It's better to secure a decent amount now than hold out for an uncertain, potentially worse outcome."
