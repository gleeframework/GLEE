"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost all of the money, leaving just $1 for Bob.  This is a classic strategy in these kinds of games, as it creates a strong incentive for Bob to accept the offer rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer.  While I could try to push for more, there's a good chance Bob will reject and we'll end up with nothing in later rounds.  Accepting this offer guarantees me half the money."
