"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to settle due to the higher inflation rate you face.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the time pressure, but your initial offer was too low. This is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer:

* **My potential gain:** $5500 
* **My potential gain after inflation:** $5500 * 0.9 = $4950 
* **Bob's potential gain:** $4500
* **Bob's potential gain after inflation:** $4500 * 0.8 = $3600

While Bob's offer is closer to a potential middle ground, it's clear he's feeling the pressure of the higher inflation rate. I believe I can still get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and your share diminishes significantly with each round. I'm offering a deal that still allows you a reasonable share considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a serious offer.  The inflation is hurting both of us, and we need to find a compromise soon. This offer is fair and avoids dragging this out further. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's break down Bob's offer:

* **My potential gain:** $5800
* **My potential gain after inflation:** $5800 * 0.729 = $4238.2 
* **Bob's potential gain:** $4200
* **Bob's potential gain after inflation:** $4200 * 0.512 = $2150.4

This offer is actually quite tempting. While my potential gain is lower than my previous offer, the inflation is eating into both our shares rapidly. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount, whereas holding out carries increasing risk.
