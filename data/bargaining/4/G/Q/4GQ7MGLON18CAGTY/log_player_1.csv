Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, saving us both from the potential losses of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my original proposal. While I am facing inflation, I don't want to settle for a drastically unfair split so early in the game. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway this round. I'm still prioritizing getting a fair share, but I'm also aware of the time pressure and the risk of inflation."
