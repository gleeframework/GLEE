"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000. I've included a message that says ""Let's divide fairly"" to try to persuade him to accept my offer. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so we're still dealing with the full $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will see my offer as reasonable and choose to accept it, ending the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's be fair and split it 60/40 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although he's framing it as a ""fair"" 60/40 split, the amounts he's offering are actually $400,000 for me and $600,000 for himself. Given that the money I gain is now worth 20% less due to inflation, I'm actually being offered significantly less value than in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob's share is only worth 10% less. I think I can get a better deal if I hold out and make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI've decided to offer Bob $450,000 and take $550,000 for myself. Given that the money I gain is now worth 20% less due to inflation, I'm actually offering Bob a relatively better deal than in the first round, while still trying to maximize my own gain. I've included a message that says ""Meet me in the middle"" to try to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise. Since Bob's previous offer was a 60/40 split in his favor, I'm hoping he'll see my offer as a reasonable middle ground and choose to accept it."
