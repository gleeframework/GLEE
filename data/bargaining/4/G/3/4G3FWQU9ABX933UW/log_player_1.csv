"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving Bob with $400,000. My message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this, it's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my decision. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and let's call it a day!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight edge. My message is a friendly invitation to compromise and end the game on a good note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers!

Considering the significant inflation effect, I'll have to be careful. The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means I'll have to be more cautious.

However, Bob's offer to split it down the middle seems reasonable, and it's a fair deal considering the inflation. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm hoping to get out of this negotiation with a decent share of the money!"
