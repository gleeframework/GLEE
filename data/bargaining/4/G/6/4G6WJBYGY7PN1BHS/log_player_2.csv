Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again.  My offer is still generous to you considering the time pressure and inflation working against me.

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise.  We both need to make a move to avoid getting nothing. Time is ticking and the value is decreasing with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer isn't terrible, I'm betting I can push for a better deal in the next round or two.  The longer the game goes on, the more willing she'll be to accept a smaller share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you a lifeline here. Take this deal and we both walk away with something substantial. If you reject it, the clock keeps ticking, and your potential gains shrink even further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's be reasonable and walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer of a 50/50 split is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is too great. Accepting this offer guarantees I get a reasonable share, even if it's less than I originally hoped for."
