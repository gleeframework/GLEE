"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000

This offer is way too unfair.  While I'm aware of the inflation, there's no way I'll accept such a small share in the first round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
This is a fair start, considering the inflation risk. I'm offering Alice a significant portion, hoping for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm still unhappy with the deal, the inflation is becoming a serious factor. Accepting this offer gives me a decent sum, and the risk of getting nothing at all is too high."
