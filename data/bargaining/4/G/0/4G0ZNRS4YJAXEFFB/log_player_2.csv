"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept and we can start fresh! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is highly unfavorable.  While it's tempting to get something, it's better to see if Alice will offer more, especially since the money will be worth less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  This is the fairest way, and it's better than getting nothing in the end!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting a better deal this time, but don't get too comfortable! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation. While the offer is better than her initial one, it's still not a fair split.  We can both do better if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""Let's compromise. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer deal for both of us.""
}
