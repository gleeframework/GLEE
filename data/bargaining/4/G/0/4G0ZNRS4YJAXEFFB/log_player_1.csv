"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can start fresh!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount of $1000, and keeping the majority of the money for myself. My message is a friendly reminder that we can end the game and start fresh if he accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  This is the fairest way, and it's better than getting nothing in the end! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'd rather get a larger share now than risk getting a smaller share later. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for a 50-50 split just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal this time, but don't get too comfortable!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a majority of the money. My message is a warning that this is a better offer than his previous one, but I'm not going easy on him just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less than the original amount, I'm getting desperate to get a good deal. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even smaller amount. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $6000 and call it a day."
