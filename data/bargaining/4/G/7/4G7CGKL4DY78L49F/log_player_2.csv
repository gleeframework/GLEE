Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I believe a fair division would be equal shares for both of us. Thus, I propose splitting the $10000 into 5000 for you and 5000 for me. This maintains a balance and ensures that neither of us feels disadvantaged by the diminishing value of money.

# Alice gain: 5000
