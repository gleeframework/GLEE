Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to compromise and give you 4000. We can still discuss further if you don't like it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
