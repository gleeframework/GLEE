"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. It's a good starting point, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000, which is a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more. You can try to do better. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, the numbers are now:

Alice's gain: 200,000 x 0.8 = 160,000
Bob's gain: 800,000 x 0.8 = 640,000

I don't like this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too skewed towards you. I'd like to propose a more balanced split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll give you $450,000, and I'll take $550,000. It's a fair split, and we can finalize the deal.""
}

Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less than the original, the numbers are now:

Alice's gain: 300,000 x 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 154,800
Bob's gain: 700,000 x 0.516 = 360,200
