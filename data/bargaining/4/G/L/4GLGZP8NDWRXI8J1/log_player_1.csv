Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives Bob a small share to incentivize him to accept, while ensuring I secure the majority of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 500,000 now and avoid the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
