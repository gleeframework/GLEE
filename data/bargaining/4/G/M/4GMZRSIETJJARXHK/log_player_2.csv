Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'll reject this offer. I want a more even split, even with the risk of inflation.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000} 
``` 
I propose a 50/50 split.  This is the fairest way to divide the money, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in that."
