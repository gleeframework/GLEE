Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable. This deal still gives you a sizable chunk, and time is ticking away. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, the value is dropping rapidly. This is a fair offer considering the time constraint.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The money is losing value fast, especially for Alice.  Every round that passes makes her increasingly desperate, which works in our favor. However, it also means our potential gains are shrinking.
* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point with 7 rounds remaining. Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Shift in Alice's Strategy:** Her offer, while presented as an ultimatum, suggests a willingness to compromise.  She's likely realizing that her initial strategy isn't working.

While we could try to push for a slightly better deal, the risk of losing everything outweighs the potential for a marginally higher gain."
