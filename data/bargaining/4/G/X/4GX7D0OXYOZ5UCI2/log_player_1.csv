Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking, and our money is shrinking.  This is a fair offer, let's be reasonable.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We're both losing money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning: While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further inflation. With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than hold out for a slightly better deal and risk ending up with even less."
