I'm proposing a 900,000/100,000 split. I'm giving Bob a small share to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering 800,000 to me and 200,000 to Bob. It's a bit less than my previous offer, but still a significant amount for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, as the inflation will make his share less valuable with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get a larger share, especially considering the impact of inflation on his side."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob.  I'm trying to strike a balance between what I think is fair and what I believe Bob might accept, given the increasing effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. Bob is getting a very large share, and his share is worth significantly less than mine due to the inflation. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer further to 600,000 for me and 400,000 for Bob. The inflation is starting to hit Bob hard, and I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept a smaller share at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I initially wanted, I'm still not satisfied with the split.  I think I can get a bit more considering the impact of inflation on Bob's share. I'm going to try one more time to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering a split of 550,000 for me and 450,000 for Bob. This is the last round I'm willing to offer before the risk of getting nothing becomes too high. I'm hoping the pressure of the dwindling time and Bob's diminishing share will make him accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome given the high inflation rates. Accepting this ensures we both get something, rather than risking getting nothing."
