"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting the same value for my share. However, Bob's share is worth 10% less than it was in the first round, which means he's trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
