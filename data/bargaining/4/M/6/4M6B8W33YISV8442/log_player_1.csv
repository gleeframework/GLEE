"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can finish the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob is aware of the inflation effect, but I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more aggressive, taking into account the inflation that affects Bob's gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a bigger share, but I'm not giving it to you that easily.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and take a smaller share, but I still want a decent chunk of the pie 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I'll consider this offer carefully. The 5200 that Bob is offering is worth less than the 6000 he offered in round 2, due to the increased inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm still not willing to accept a 48/52 split, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's offers getting progressively worse due to the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the current state of the economy.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Time to make a real compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I still want to get a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I'll consider this offer. However, I notice that Bob's offer is still not as good as my previous offer, and I'm not sure if he's taking into account the true value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 56/44 split, especially considering the current state of the economy. I think I can do better."

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I'll consider this offer. However, I notice that Bob's offer is still not as good as my previous offer, and I'm starting to think that he's not taking into account the true value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's the best I've seen so far, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money."
