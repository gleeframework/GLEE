"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give you all the money. You can either accept or reject this offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a 20% share of the initial $10,000. I'm keeping $8,000 for myself, which is 80% of the initial amount."
