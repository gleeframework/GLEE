  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take $6,000 and you'll get $4,000. What do you say?""
}

Your turn, Bob!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great deal for me, considering the money is worth 10% less now. I'll reject this offer.
