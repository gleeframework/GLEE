"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively fair split, but I'm open to negotiations if Bob wants to try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, but I think I can do better than that 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 is actually worth 40% of the original amount, which is $40.

I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle, but I'm not sure I want to reject this offer either. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected the previous offer, it's my turn again. With the inflation, the money is worth 40% of the original amount, so I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is still a fair split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can get a better deal than that, Alice. You can do better than 40% 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 32% of the original amount, which is $32.

I'm not sure I want to give Bob 60% of the money, but I'm not sure I want to reject this offer either. I'll think about it...
