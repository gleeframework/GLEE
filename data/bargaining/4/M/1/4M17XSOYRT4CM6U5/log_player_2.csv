Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next. I'm not satisfied with 40 dollars.

I'm just the player, not the game master. My response should only be:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Please proceed with Alice's next decision."
