Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to resolve this.  We both benefit before inflation eats further into the value. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough one!  While ideally I'd want a bit more, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage makes the most sense for a few reasons:

* **Inflation Impact:** Alice is right, inflation is eating into the value of the money, particularly for her. The longer this goes on, the less appealing even a slightly favorable split becomes.
* **Time Pressure:** We're over halfway through the rounds. Holding out much longer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split, while not ideal from a pure maximization perspective, is objectively fair."
