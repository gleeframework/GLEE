"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $20 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $16.

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with less than half of the original amount. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll aim to maximize my gain. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $60, which is 60% of the current value of the money, and I'll take the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $10 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is approximately $5.12.

Considering the drastic reduction in value, I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with less than 10% of the original amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth significantly less after four rounds of inflation, I'll aim to maximize my gain. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $70, which is 70% of the current value of the money, and I'll take the remaining 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lion's share, it's my last offer 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $1 is now worth 32.77% of its original value, which is approximately $0.32.

Considering the extremely low value of the money, I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with less than 1% of the original amount. I'll reject this offer and end the game.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","At this point, the money is worth a tiny fraction of its original value, and I'm not going to get a significant amount no matter what. Since I've already rejected Bob's offer, I might as well try to get something, even if it's a tiny amount.

Here's my final offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 99,
  ""message"": ""You're taking it all, I guess""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $99, and I'll take the remaining $1. It's not a great deal, but it's better than nothing."
