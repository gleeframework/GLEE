"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This gives me a good starting point, and since the money is worth more to me than Bob in the early rounds, I think this is a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to 80/20. While Bob's offer was very unfavorable, I still want to try to get a decent share of the money. I'm hoping this compromise will convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not willing to accept such a low share. Even though inflation is hurting Bob more, I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to 70/30. With each passing round, Bob's share of the money is becoming increasingly less valuable. I'm hoping that by making a small concession, I can entice him to accept before inflation completely devalues his gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is a bit better than his last one, it's still not enough. I'm sticking to my goal of getting a majority share of the money.  I believe I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to lower my offer once more to 60/40.  Inflation is starting to hit Bob hard, and I believe this offer is a fair compromise that will incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than a 50/50 split. With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is on Bob to accept a fairer offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, it's time to meet Bob halfway. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, a fair and equitable solution for both of us.  I believe this will be a good outcome for both of us."
