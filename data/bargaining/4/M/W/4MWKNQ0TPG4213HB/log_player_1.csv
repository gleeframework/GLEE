"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40, and I'll keep $60. I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept my proposal. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is fairer.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I don't feel the need to compromise yet. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering the inflation affecting his gains.

{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nI've offered Bob $43, which is a bit more than my previous offer, and I'll keep $57. I've included a message to encourage Bob to meet me halfway and accept my proposal. Let's see how he responds!"
