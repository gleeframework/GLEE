Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you want a fair deal, but I need to plan for the future. This offer is better for me in the long run.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  The core concept is that money loses value over time. Since Bob loses value faster (20% per round vs. Alice's 10%), it's in his best interest to secure a larger portion sooner rather than later.
* **Strategic Bargaining:** By offering slightly more than half, Bob shows a willingness to negotiate but also asserts his need for a larger share due to the inflation disadvantage. The message aims to make Alice understand the rationale without being confrontational. 
* **Future Rounds:**  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will be in a weaker position in subsequent rounds as the money continues to lose value. This offer attempts to strike a balance between an acceptable outcome for Alice and securing a reasonable amount for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to an acceptable range, but it's still not advantageous enough for Bob considering the rapid inflation working against him. Here's why:

* **Relative Loss:** Even with the adjusted values, Bob is losing significantly more value than Alice with each passing round. Accepting this offer would mean losing a substantial portion of the initial potential gain.
* **Bargaining Power:** By rejecting this offer, Bob signals to Alice that he's serious about accounting for the inflation and won't settle for a deal heavily skewed in her favor. This keeps the door open for a more balanced counter-offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Time is running out for Bob. While rejecting carries the risk of Alice offering even less in the next round, the potential reward of securing a larger portion by holding out a bit longer is still significant enough to justify the risk."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to account for the inflation affecting us both. Let's end this here.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The rate of inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential gains. Each round that passes significantly reduces the value of the money. It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Finality:** By stating this is his final offer, Bob emphasizes the urgency and seriousness of the situation. It signals to Alice that further negotiation is unlikely to result in a more favorable outcome for her.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  While a 50/50 split might seem generous to Alice given her lower inflation rate, framing it as a fair compromise emphasizes that both parties are making concessions due to the unusual circumstances. This could make the offer more palatable and increase the chances of acceptance."
