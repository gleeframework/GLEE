"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'm effectively getting 40 * 0.9 = 36. This is less than my original proposal of 50, but I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to account for the decreasing value of money.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
