"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money is worth less now. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 3200,

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer was 50/50. This way, I'll get a smaller share, but it's still a decent compromise.""
