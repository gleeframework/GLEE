"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my share would be 450,000, and Bob's share would be 450,000.

I'll accept this offer.
