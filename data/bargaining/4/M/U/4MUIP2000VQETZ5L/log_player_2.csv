**Reasoning:**

Even though the value of the money is rapidly decreasing, accepting Alice's offer at this stage would be a terrible deal for Bob in the long run.  She's clearly trying to take advantage of his higher inflation rate. Holding out a bit longer might force Alice to propose a more reasonable split, especially as she also faces losses with each passing round."
