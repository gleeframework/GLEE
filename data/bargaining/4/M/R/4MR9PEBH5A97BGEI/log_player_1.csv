"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 3:7 is a fairer split than 2:8 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 480,000 (60% of 800,000, since 1,000,000 * 0.8 = 800,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 3:7 split is still quite skewed in his favor. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 384,000 (48% of 800,000, since 800,000 * 0.6 = 480,000 * 0.8 = 384,000).

I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more reasonable. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think 6.5:3.5 is still a fairer split than 3:7 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 240,000 (48% of 500,000, since 800,000 * 0.6 = 480,000 * 0.5 = 240,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 6.5:3.5 split is still quite skewed in his favor. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

However, I also need to consider that the money is decreasing in value rapidly due to inflation. I might need to take a more aggressive stance to get a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 192,000 (38.4% of 500,000, since 800,000 * 0.6 = 480,000 * 0.8 = 384,000 * 0.5 = 192,000).

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, considering the rapid decrease in the value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a better deal than 6.5:3.5.""
