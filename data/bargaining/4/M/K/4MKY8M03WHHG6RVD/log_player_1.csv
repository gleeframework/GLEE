Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me taking the larger share. I figure it's a good starting point, given Bob's money depreciates faster than mine. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

A 50/50 split is a fair offer given the inflation rate.  It's better than risking further negotiation and potential loss due to the shrinking value of the money."
