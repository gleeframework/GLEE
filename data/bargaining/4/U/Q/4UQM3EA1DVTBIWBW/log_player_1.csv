I'm going for a slightly aggressive start.  I'm assuming Bob will be a bit more risk-averse and might take this offer rather than risk getting less in a later round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would have preferred more, taking a 50/50 split is a good deal considering the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds.  The inflation risk is too high to gamble on getting a better offer later."
