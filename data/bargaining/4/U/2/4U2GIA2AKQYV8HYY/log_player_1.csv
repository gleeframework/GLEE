Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a slightly uneven split, hoping to secure a good portion of the money before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a bigger share, the inflation factor is starting to have a real impact. A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances, and accepting ensures I get something rather than risking losing even more in the next round."
