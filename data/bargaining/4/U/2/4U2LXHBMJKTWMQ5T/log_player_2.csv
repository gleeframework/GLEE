"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 90% of its original value due to inflation, I'll propose a division that takes that into account.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains more severely, I'll need to be cautious. However, this offer is still a decent one, considering the reduced value of the money.
