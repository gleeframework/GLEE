"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting with a fair offer. Let's split it 60-40.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'm keeping 60%, which is $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to get the larger share, which is fair considering he rejected my initial offer.

However, I'm not convinced that I should give him the larger share without getting a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think 54-46 is a fair split. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
