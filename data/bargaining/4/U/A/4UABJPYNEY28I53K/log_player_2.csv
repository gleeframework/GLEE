"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk to start with.  Let's see if we can work something better out in the next few rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though it's a ""decent chunk"", it's worth considering that with each round, the money loses value. It's likely that Alice will offer less in the next round, and with the money being worth less to her, she'll be happy to take a bigger cut.  Let's see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. 50/50 is the most logical way to split the money, and it ensures we both get a decent amount.  This way, we can avoid losing too much value due to inflation.""
