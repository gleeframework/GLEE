"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the money loses value faster for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 880000 
# Bob gain: 120000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have liked to have gotten more, I'm happy to accept this offer.  The money is losing value quickly, and the next round would likely give me less."
