"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going for a big initial offer, hoping to secure the majority of the money early on. While I want to be fair, I need to be strategic to make sure I don't lose out on the potential value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal. While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, I believe I can still negotiate for a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, decreasing my share to 80% and increasing Bob's to 20%. This signals that I'm willing to compromise but still want a good portion of the money.  The inflation is starting to be a factor, so I need to balance the need to get a good deal with the risk of losing out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to bite, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal. Accepting this offer secures me at least some money, while rejecting it risks getting nothing at all.  While I'm not happy with a 60/40 split, it's a better outcome than risking it all for a potential, but not guaranteed, larger share."
