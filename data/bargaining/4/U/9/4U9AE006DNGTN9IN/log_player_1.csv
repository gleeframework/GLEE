"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to try to get a big chunk of the money in this first round, as the inflation will hit us both harder in the next round.  I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is still a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though Bob is offering a larger share than I offered him in the first round, the inflation will drastically reduce the value of my share. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob a 40% share.  While the inflation has hurt me, I'm still aiming for a larger portion.  It's a decent offer to Bob considering the inflation, and he might be willing to take it to avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though this isn't an ideal outcome, with the inflation, my share is significantly lower than what I initially aimed for. I'm accepting this offer to avoid potentially getting an even smaller share in the next round."
