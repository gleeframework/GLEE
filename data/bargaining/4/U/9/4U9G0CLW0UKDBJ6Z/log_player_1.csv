"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it might seem tempting to try and get more, accepting Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is the best course of action in Round 2. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for Bob, making him more likely to accept a fair deal now than later.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee you can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. Bob could propose an even less favorable split, putting you in a weaker position. 
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is inherently fair, and prolonging the negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome for you. 

Accepting now guarantees you a reasonable share and ends the game on a fair note."
