"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to meet me in the middle, but at a cost to me. Considering the inflation, my gain of $2500 is worth 95% of $3000, which is the amount I would have gotten in the first round. That's a significant reduction.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or not.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation. Since my gain is worth 5% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting more, but I'm still not giving up too much""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'm not there yet 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up with me! My gain of $3500 is worth 71.74% of $6000, which is the amount I would have gotten in the first round. That's a significant hit.

I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits of accepting this offer. Since Bob's message suggests he's not satisfied with this offer, I'm not sure if he'll make another proposal.
