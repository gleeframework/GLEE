"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I take $990,000 and Bob takes $10,000. It's a large share for me, but I figure it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is definitely impacting the value of the money. Accepting this offer secures a significant amount for me, and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round."
