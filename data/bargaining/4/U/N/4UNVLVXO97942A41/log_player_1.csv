"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual values. For me, the 50$ I would gain is actually 50 * 0.8 = 40$ (20% less than the original 50$). For Bob, the 50$ he would gain is actually 50 * 0.9 = 45$ (10% less than the original 50$).

Considering this, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll make a new offer. I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself to account for the decreased value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
