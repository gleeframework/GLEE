"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 600,000 dollars and leave 400,000 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is the reverse of my previous offer, I'll accept this offer.
