"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but generous split.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. The split is not fair, and I believe I can get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice:\n\n# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. How about a more even split?\n# Bob gain: 600000\n# Alice gain: 400000\n\n###\n\nLet me know Alice's response.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, so I'll need to take that into account when making offers and considering Alice's proposals.)\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Alice's decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince I've already made my offer in the previous response, I'll just reiterate it here in the JSON format you requested:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. How about a more even split?""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is worth 20% less for me in this round compared to the initial value, so I'm actually offering 600000 * 0.8 = 480000 in terms of the original value.)\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to Alice's response.\n\n###\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Alice's decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. This offer is fair and keeps the value of our gains high. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nThe offer is still not fair, considering the significant decrease in value for me due to inflation. I'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the current devalued amount.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice:\n\n# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's adjust the split again.\n# Bob gain: 700000\n# Alice gain: 300000\n\n###\n\nLet me know Alice's response.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is worth 36% less for me now, so I'm actually offering 700000 * 0.64 = 448000 in terms of the original value.)\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Alice's decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's adjust the split again.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is worth 36% less for me in this round, and it will decrease further in the next round. I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable agreement before the value drops even more.)\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to Alice's response.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Alice's decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value with each round. Let's be reasonable and settle on a split that's closer to the middle. This offer is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for me due to inflation (59.04% less), I believe this offer is the best I can get at this point. Further rounds will only decrease the value more, making it even less desirable. I'll accept Alice's offer to minimize the loss.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've accepted her offer.\n\n###\n\nI'm willing to settle on this split to avoid further devaluation.\n\n###\n\nGame over, I suppose!"
