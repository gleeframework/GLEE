"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll take $500,000 and Bob will take $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but you'll still get a good chunk! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 25/75 split, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 375000, ""bob_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm proposing a 37.5/62.5 split, which is a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, but still a bit more in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect too much more! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy about the 20/80 split, and I think I can do better. I'll try to negotiate again. The decreasing value of the money due to inflation is making it harder for me to get a good deal, but I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of again!""}

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, which is a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, but still a bit more in his favor. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not being too greedy."
