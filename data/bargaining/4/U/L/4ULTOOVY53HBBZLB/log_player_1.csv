"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the money, and we can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a fair split, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the new amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 * 0.8 = 4000
* Bob gain: 5000 * 0.8 = 4000

I'll accept this offer since it's still a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less valuable money.
