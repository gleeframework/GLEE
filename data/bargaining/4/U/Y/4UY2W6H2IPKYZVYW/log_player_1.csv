"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too much in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 70/30 split.  Time is money, and every round costs us.  Take this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
