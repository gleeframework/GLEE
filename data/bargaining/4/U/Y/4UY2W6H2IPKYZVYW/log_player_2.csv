{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too much in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 70/30 split.  Time is money, and every round costs us.  Take this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. We both lost money in the last round, so we need to be pragmatic.  I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is closer to your last offer.  Let's end this game before we lose too much more. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
