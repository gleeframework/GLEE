"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a generous offer to try to get Bob to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I propose a more balanced split.  Accept this and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than before, so I'd be getting 480,000$ if I accept this offer.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is really fair, considering the inflation difference. I'd rather try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'd be getting 384,000$ if I accept this offer.

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

  ""message"": ""You're being too soft, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
