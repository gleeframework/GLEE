"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob.  Let's split it 990k to 10k. It's a good deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice is being generous now, Bob can do much better by waiting a few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. How about a 65/35 split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we both know I could have gotten more in the previous round. Let's be reasonable this time. A 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is right, she could have gotten more in the previous round. Bob still has some leverage here. While the 60/40 split is better than her initial offer, there's room for Alice to lose more as inflation eats into her potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  70/30 is my final offer.""}"
