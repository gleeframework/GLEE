Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, you'll lose a significant chunk if you wait any longer. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
