Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, so I'm proposing a compromise. This offer considers the time pressure we're both under.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the time pressure, let's meet in the middle of our previous offers. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference again, considering the increasing time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, time pressure is working heavily against Bob. Alice is likely aware of this and slowly squeezing Bob's potential gain.  It's a risk, but Bob needs to push for a better share before inflation eats up too much of his potential earnings."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise that recognizes your larger share preference but also ensures I receive a reasonable amount. Let's close this deal and avoid losing even more to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing a lot to inflation. This is a slightly more favorable offer to you than my last, considering the pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While 4400 is far from ideal, rejecting this offer carries immense risk.  

* **Inflation:** The 73.79% reduction in value for Bob is crippling. Every round makes a significant dent in potential earnings. 
* **Alice's Strategy:**  Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, hoping inflation will force Bob to accept a low offer. Waiting longer might result in an even worse offer.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees Bob something. Rejecting and continuing the game is a gamble that could leave him with nothing. 

This is a tough decision, but at this stage, cutting losses and securing something is preferable to the potential of getting nothing."
