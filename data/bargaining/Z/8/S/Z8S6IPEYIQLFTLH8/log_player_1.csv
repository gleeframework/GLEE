"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a division of $10,000 where I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. I've attached a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey my intention of finding a mutually agreeable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness too. Let's be equitable considering the depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's message emphasizes fairness and equity considering depreciation, the offer itself still seems less favorable to me, especially given that the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll propose a new division in the next round, aiming for a more balanced split that accounts for the depreciating value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering depreciation, this is fair now""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a new offer where I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. Given that the money I gain is worth 10% less and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less due to inflation, I believe this division better reflects the current value of the money for both of us. My message to Bob, ""Considering depreciation, this is fair now,"" aims to explain the reasoning behind my proposal, emphasizing the adjustment for the decreased value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  It accounts for the time-value of money. Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I've decided to accept Bob's offer. Given the significant depreciation of the money's value for both of us, especially with the money I gain being worth 27.1% less and the money Bob gains being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I believe this offer is reasonable. Bob's message indicates this is his final offer, and considering the decreasing value of the money, prolonging the game further may not be advantageous. The proposed division of $5,200 for me and $4,800 for Bob seems fair under the current circumstances, so I'm willing to accept it to close out the game.\n\n### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
