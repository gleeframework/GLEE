"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less, I'm getting a bit more cautious. I'd rather not give up 60% of the reduced value of the money. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more favorable offer this time. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll think carefully before making my next move. Given the further decrease in the value of the money, I'm starting to lean towards accepting a proposal that's closer to 50-50. This offer is still a bit in Bob's favor, but it's getting closer. I'll accept this offer.
