"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""Let's divide the funds with a 3:1 ratio. I'll take 75% and you'll get the remaining 25%. This should be fair considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share. This way, we can still divide the funds and avoid further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
