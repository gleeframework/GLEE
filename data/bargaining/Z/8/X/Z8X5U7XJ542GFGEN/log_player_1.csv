"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is a friendly and cooperative approach to initiate the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a slightly more even split.  Let's try this? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is significantly less than in the first round. A 40-60 split is not favorable to me, especially since the value of the money has decreased by 20% for me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle?""}\n\nConsidering the effects of inflation, I'm offering a 50-50 split to meet Bob in the middle. This way, we both compromise, and the decreasing value of the money is somewhat balanced between us. The message ""Meet in the middle?"" is a clear and concise way to convey my intention of finding a mutually acceptable agreement."
