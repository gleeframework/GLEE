"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and take 80%. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't complain about 60% 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amount I'd gain from Bob's offer is $6,000 * 0.9 = $5,400.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
