Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation will hit you harder 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you hard, I think it's time for me to take a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting worse, accepting would mean I get the equivalent of $156,000 compared to the original round (due to two rounds of inflation). 

It's a gamble, but I'm hoping Bob understands that dragging this out hurts me more than him, and he might be willing to compromise to end the game soon."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's a decent share for you and avoids further losses for me due to inflation. Let's be reasonable and end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly aiming for a larger share, and the inflation is hurting me badly. I need to make a final, relatively generous offer to entice him to settle now before the value diminishes even further. This offer is still more beneficial to me than accepting his previous offer after another round of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing a lot to inflation, I think it's time for me to take the lion's share 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the math doesn't lie. Accepting this offer nets me the equivalent of $97,920 compared to the original amount due to three rounds of inflation.  

Rejecting this means I risk an even worse deal next round, with the value of my potential gains decreasing even further. It's highly unlikely Bob will offer anything close to a fair deal now, and the longer this drags on, the more I lose."
