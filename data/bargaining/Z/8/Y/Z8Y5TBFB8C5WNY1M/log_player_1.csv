"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a small amount, or if he's going to try to get more in later rounds.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I'm assuming he'll be more motivated to take something now rather than risk losing more later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 215312.76 
# Bob gain: 784687.24 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the first round, but I'm still not convinced it's fair.  The inflation is a major factor here, and I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'll try to make a counter-offer that is more in line with what I believe is a fair split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  Since inflation is affecting the value of the money, I think it's fair to split it evenly.  This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I can avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round."
