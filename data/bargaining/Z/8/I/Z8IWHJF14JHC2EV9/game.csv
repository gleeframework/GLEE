51.0,49.0,Let's start fair.  I'm proposing a 51/49 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point for a reasonable outcome for both of us.  What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Your offer was a bit too greedy for me, Alice. How about we try a 55/45 split in my favor this time?  It accounts for the inflation that's working against me more than you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Okay, let's try a 50/50 split.  Inflation is a factor, but I think fairness is more important in the long run.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",Alice,3,
