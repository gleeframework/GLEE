"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 50-50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, my gain is worth 10% less than in Round 1, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
