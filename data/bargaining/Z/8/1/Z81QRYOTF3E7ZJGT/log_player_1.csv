"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can split the $10,000 in half."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less, $4000 is now equivalent to $4000 / 0.9 = $4444.44 in the first round's value. 

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

This way, I'm aiming to get a slightly larger share of the money, considering the reduced value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased rate of inflation, the money is losing value rapidly. To calculate the equivalent value in the first round, I'll divide $3500 by 0.727 (1 - 0.273 = 0.727, which represents 100% - 27.1% inflation).

$3500 / 0.727 ≈ $4814.19 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the rapidly increasing inflation, I need to adjust my proposal again. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

I'm trying to balance the risk of inflation with the potential for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the accelerated inflation, the money is losing value rapidly. To calculate the equivalent value in the first round, I'll divide $3000 by 0.5915 (1 - 0.4085 = 0.5915, which represents 100% - 40.95% inflation).

$3000 / 0.5915 ≈ $5064.35 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer. The reduced value of my share is not enough to make it a worthwhile deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation continuing to rise, I need to be cautious. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 3800, ""bob_gain"": 6200}

I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, but I'm also aware that the value of the money will continue to decrease with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, the money is losing value rapidly. To calculate the equivalent value in the first round, I'll divide $2500 by 0.474 (1 - 0.526 = 0.474, which represents 100% - 52.17% inflation).

$2500 / 0.474 ≈ $5286.53 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer. The reduced value of my share is not enough to make it a worthwhile deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation continuing to rise, I need to be extremely cautious. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}

I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, but I'm also aware that the value of the money will continue to decrease with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, the money is losing value rapidly. To calculate the equivalent value in the first round, I'll divide $2000 by 0.386 (1 - 0.614 = 0.386, which represents 100% - 61.26% inflation).

$2000 / 0.386 ≈ $5185.03 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer. The reduced value of my share is not enough to make it a worthwhile deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation continuing to rise, I need to be extremely cautious. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 3200, ""bob_gain"": 6800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, the money is losing value rapidly. To calculate the equivalent value in the first round, I'll divide $1500 by 0.315 (1 - 0.685 = 0.315, which represents 100% - 68.62% inflation).

$1500 / 0.315 ≈ $4761.27 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer. The reduced value of my share is not ideal, but it's the best I can get at this point, and I don't want to risk going into the 13th round with even lower values.
