Let's see if Bob is greedy or fair.  I'm taking almost everything, leaving him with a measly dollar."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a 50/50 split, and while the inflation is a factor, I'm not sure how much worse it will get.  Accepting now guarantees me half the money, while rejecting could lead to a worse outcome."
