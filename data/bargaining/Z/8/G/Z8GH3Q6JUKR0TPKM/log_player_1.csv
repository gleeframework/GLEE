"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you a decent share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping for more later! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Round 3

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share!""
}
```

I've adjusted my proposal to reflect the 10% inflation, and I'm now offering a 42-58 split. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise!"

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
