"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm more affected by inflation.

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm losing value faster, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll take the offer since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and Alice's offer is relatively fair considering the inflation rates."
