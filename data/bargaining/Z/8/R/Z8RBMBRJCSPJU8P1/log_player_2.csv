"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I want the most.  Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more in my favor. Since the money is worth 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to accept a deal that's less favorable to her. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle... sort of.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than that.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me than in the first round, I need to consider the decreased value. However, Alice's message suggests that this is her final offer, so I may not be able to negotiate further.

Given the decreasing value of the money for both of us, I think this offer is relatively fair. I'll accept it to ensure I get a decent share of the money.
