Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Explanation:

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game continues, the more value Alice loses. Waiting any longer will only result in increasingly worse offers from Bob.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob knows Alice is facing inflation.  He's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than a 50/50 split because he's not losing value over time.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting Bob's offer risks getting a worse deal in the next round. The potential loss from continued inflation outweighs the potential gain of holding out for a slightly better offer."
