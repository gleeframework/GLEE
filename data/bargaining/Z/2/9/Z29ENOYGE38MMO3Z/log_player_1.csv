# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to give you most of it if you meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's desperation is my gain! With the money being worth less and less, I'm willing to take a slightly lower percentage to get the deal done. 75% is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept this offer. Let's finalize the deal!"
