"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a classic negotiation scenario, and the strategy is to try and get as much as possible while ensuring Bob still has enough incentive to accept the offer. In the first round, there's less risk of Bob rejecting the offer, as he has no prior information. I'm offering a very favorable split for myself while still giving Bob a small gain.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's important to consider the inflation factor now.  Even though Bob is offering me less than I proposed in the first round, the value of the money I'm losing is less due to the inflation. It's also important to consider the possibility of Bob's offer getting worse with each round. Accepting this offer is a safe bet, securing a significant portion of the money before the inflation significantly impacts my potential gains."
