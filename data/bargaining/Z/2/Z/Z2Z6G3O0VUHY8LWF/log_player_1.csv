"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving up too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less for Bob, he's trying to make a slightly better offer. However, I'm not satisfied with the 30% I'd get. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Considering the money is worth less for Bob, he's trying to make a better offer again. This time, he's offering me 65% of the initial $100, which is $65, and keeping 35%, which is $35.

I'm tempted to accept this offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I think I can try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. I think this is a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $50. I think this is a reasonable compromise, and it's a good chance for us to finally settle on a deal."
