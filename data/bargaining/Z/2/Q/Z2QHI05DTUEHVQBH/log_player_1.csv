"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take advantage of the first mover advantage, but I'm willing to be generous.  Let's see if you accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too keen on being taken advantage of by the ""first mover advantage""!

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced it's fair. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll take that into account in my new offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we both know inflation is a factor, I think a slightly higher share for me is justified.  Let's end this game, I'm sure we both have better things to do with our time. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'm not convinced that's fair.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think you're considering the inflation fairly. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a higher share, but I think 42/58 is a fairer split.""
}
