"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see if Bob is willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair middle ground 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, the $5,000 I would get is actually worth $4,750 in real terms.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50/50 split, considering I would be getting less in real value than I would have in the first round. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on a 55/45 split, but I'm willing to give you a bit more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think 52/48 is a better split for me 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains. Considering the offer, I'll calculate the real value of the money I'd get: $4,800 is worth $4,080 in real terms.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with a 52/48 split, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd rather not give up more than I have to. I'll accept the offer.
