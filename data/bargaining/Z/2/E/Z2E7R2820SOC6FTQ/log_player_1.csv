"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my initial proposal, it's better to secure a 40% share of the remaining value than risk further inflation and potentially end up with nothing."
