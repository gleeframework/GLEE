"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a significant share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, and the inflation is working against me. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share a bit, but still offering a decent amount to Bob. I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept and avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough, and the inflation is really starting to bite into my potential earnings. I need to find a way to get him to accept a better deal before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still trying to be fair to Bob. The inflation is accelerating, and I need to get this deal done before we both lose out significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, as the inflation is heavily impacting the value of the money. However, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair, and accepting ensures I get something rather than risk getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting offers."
