``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to wear me down, hoping I'll panic as the rounds progress.  He's consistently offering me less than 50%, banking on the inflation to scare me.  However, even with the shrinking value, I need to hold out for a better deal.  Accepting anything less than 50% at this stage sets a bad precedent and will likely lead to even worse offers from Bob."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is our last chance. We're both losing money with every passing round. I'm offering you a slightly larger share this time, but it's the best deal you'll get. Let's finalize this and stop wasting our time. 
# Alice gain: 46 
# Bob gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical moment. Bob knows I'm feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. However, his offer is still unacceptable. It's only a tiny improvement from his previous offer, and it's still below the 50% mark. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even if it means risking everything in the final rounds."
