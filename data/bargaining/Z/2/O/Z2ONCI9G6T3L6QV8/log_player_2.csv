Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40/60, I'll try to counter with a 60/40 split, which is the reverse of her offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting! 

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Alice's offer is still a 55/45 split, I'll try to counter with an even more favorable split for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the reduced value of money, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer a 70/30 split, which is a more significant advantage for me.
