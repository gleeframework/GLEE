"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40 dollars, which is a generous offer considering the inflation factor!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is mirroring my previous offer!

I'll decide to reject this offer as well. The offer remains the same as the previous round, and I'm not willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more aggressive with his offer!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money for both of us, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth much less for me now, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
