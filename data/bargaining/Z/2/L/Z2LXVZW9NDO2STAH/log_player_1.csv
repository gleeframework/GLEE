"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the offers!

I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm more interested in getting a larger share now, considering the decreasing value of the money over time.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, I'll aim to get a larger share, considering the inflation effect.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which should be more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the decreasing value of the money Bob gains, I'll think about this new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still interested in getting a larger share.

However, Bob's offer is closer to a 60/40 split, which is more favorable to me compared to the 70/30 split I proposed earlier.

I'll accept this offer.
