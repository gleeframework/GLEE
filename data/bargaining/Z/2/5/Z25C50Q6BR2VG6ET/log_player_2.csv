Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't think I'll back down 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation more than Bob, and her offers are getting worse for her.  While this offer is closer to the middle, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to wait as long as he doesn't get too greedy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer and let's be done with it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

We need to start applying more pressure.  While waiting is good, we also don't want to push Alice too far and risk her accepting the increasingly bad deals for her (but good for Bob).  This offer is still favorable to Bob, but carries a more urgent message."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate? 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning.  While not ideal, this offer is barely acceptable considering the inflation rates.  Alice's taunt also suggests she may be willing to let the game run out, which would leave Bob with nothing.  It's too risky to continue."
