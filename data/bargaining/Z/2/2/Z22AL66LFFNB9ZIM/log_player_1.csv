Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer to see if Bob is willing to accept even a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. It's a very similar unfair deal to the one I proposed. I'm hoping this will lead to a more equitable negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing an even split to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
