Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Alice is trying to trick me into thinking it's the same offer as before! Since the money is worth 19% less due to inflation, the actual offer is different.

Let me calculate the actual amounts:
Alice's offer in Round 1: Bob gets $3000, Alice gets $7000
Due to 19% inflation, Bob's share is worth 81% of $3000, which is $2430
Due to 19% inflation, Alice's share is worth 81% of $7000, which is $5670

Alice's offer in Round 3: Bob gets $4000, Alice gets $6000
Due to 19% inflation, Bob's share is worth 81% of $4000, which is $3240
Due to 19% inflation, Alice's share is worth 81% of $6000, which is $4860

I see that Alice's offer in Round 3 is actually better for me than her offer in Round 1, but worse than my original offer in Round 2.
