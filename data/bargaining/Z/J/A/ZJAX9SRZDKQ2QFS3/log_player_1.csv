"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll take $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to the game, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being a bit greedy, let's try to find a middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable than my initial proposal. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up so much more than I proposed earlier.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after the first round, and another 10% less after the second round, it's now worth 81% of its original value.

Considering this, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split in my favor, which is a more even split than my initial offer, but still slightly in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the middle ground, but I'm still not convinced you're being fair! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of its original value (90% * 81%).

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'm getting closer to the middle ground, but I'm not sure if I want to give up even more. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

However, I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal, and I'm not sure if Bob is being entirely fair. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of its original value.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you the majority, but I still think I deserve a bit more than 40%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split in Bob's favor, which is a more even split than my previous offers. I'm hoping that this will be more acceptable to Bob, but I'm still trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself."
