"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me 400,000, which is worth 5% less than my initial proposal of 500,000. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, my new target is to get as close to the original 500,000 as possible. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm aiming to get slightly above 490,000, which is 2% less than my initial proposal. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 450k, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than the original, I'm now aiming to get as close to 490,000 as possible. However, Bob's offer of 450,000 is still a bit short of that target.

I'll decide to reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm holding out for a better deal, hoping to get closer to my target of 490,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20.52% less than the original, I'll adjust my target accordingly. Considering the offers I've seen so far, I'll aim to get a bit closer to 450,000, but not too far from it, to leave room for negotiation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
