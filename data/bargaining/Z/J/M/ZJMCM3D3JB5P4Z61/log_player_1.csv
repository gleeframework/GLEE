"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good compromise. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation will affect us both differently. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm making a concession. Let's settle!""
}
```

I've reduced my initial offer by 200, taking into account the inflation and trying to find a middle ground. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept."
