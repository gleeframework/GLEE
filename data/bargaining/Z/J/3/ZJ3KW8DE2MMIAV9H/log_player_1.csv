"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider the offer carefully. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll assume his gain is actually equivalent to 4800 in the first round. That's still a higher offer than mine in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
