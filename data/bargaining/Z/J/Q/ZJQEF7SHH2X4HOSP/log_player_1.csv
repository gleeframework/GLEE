"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the 100 dollars, and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more generous offer than before, but I'm not sure it's fair 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by inflation as Bob is. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even compromise than my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer and we can end the game."
