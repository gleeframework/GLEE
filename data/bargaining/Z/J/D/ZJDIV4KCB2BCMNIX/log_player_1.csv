Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split.  This is still a fair deal considering the risk of making a counter-offer, and it ensures a good return for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
