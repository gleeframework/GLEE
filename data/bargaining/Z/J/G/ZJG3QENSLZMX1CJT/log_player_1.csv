Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer, hoping to maximize my gains in the first round. I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is much worse than my initial proposal, accepting it is the best choice for me.  The inflation rate means that if I reject this offer and make a counter-proposal,  I'll likely get even less than $1000 in the next round. It's better to take the $1000 now."
