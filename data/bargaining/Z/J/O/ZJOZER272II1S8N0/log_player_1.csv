"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get this over with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, I'm getting a better deal than I initially proposed, but Bob is getting an even better deal than I initially proposed.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30 in his favor, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of.""
}
```"
