Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with an offer that gives me almost everything. It's highly unlikely Bob will accept it, but it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's likely that Bob won't give me any more than this.  Since the money I get is worth 20% less, I'm better off accepting this fair deal."
