"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, I propose we split the money 60/40.  This seems fair to me as a starting point, considering the inflation working against me."" 
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting point heavily favors you. Let's be realistic - I'm not accepting a deal where I lose money due to inflation in the next round. This offer gives us both a chance to benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about the inflation affecting us both.  My counter-offer acknowledges that while still aiming for a somewhat faster resolution to benefit us both."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The longer this negotiation goes, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us, but especially for me.  
* **Finding Middle Ground:** Bob rejected my initial 60/40 split. His counter-proposal was heavily skewed in his favor. My new offer is a compromise, moving closer to the middle while still giving me a slight advantage to compensate for the rapid inflation I face."
