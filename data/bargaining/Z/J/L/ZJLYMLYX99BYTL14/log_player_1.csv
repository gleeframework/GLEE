Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I believe the value of the money is not so different between us. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, as I'm willing to take more risk in this game. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
