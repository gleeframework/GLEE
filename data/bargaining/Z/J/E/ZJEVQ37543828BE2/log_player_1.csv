"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I'm hoping to get a better deal later on. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is getting less valuable, and Bob is trying to get a better deal later on. I'll have to be strategic.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 20% bite, the money is getting scarcer. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm taking the lead now. Accept or face further erosion of the money's value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better. Let's try to find a more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking its toll, the money is getting increasingly worthless. I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Since Bob is proposing a 50/50 split, I'll have to think carefully about whether I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if this is the best I can get. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll try to take a firmer stance and make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking control now. Accept this offer and avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to make a comeback. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a significant toll on the value of the money, I'll have to be careful not to give up too much. However, Bob's offer is a slight improvement from his previous one, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further losses. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take this offer. It's better than risking further erosion of the money's value.""
}
```"
