"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the original $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and Bob will get 10%, which is $100,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 90%, I'll take 40% this time. Next round, I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'd get $400,000, which is worth 80% of the original $500,000 (due to the 20% inflation from the first round). Bob would get $600,000, which is worth 90% of the original $666,667 (due to the 10% inflation from the first round).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, as I'd be giving up a significant amount of money. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 70% this time, but I'm not budging much more than that. Your turn again!""
