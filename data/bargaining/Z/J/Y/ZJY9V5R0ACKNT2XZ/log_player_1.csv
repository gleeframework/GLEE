"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money, I need to reassess the offer.

In this round, the total amount is $8,000 (10,000 x 0.8). My gain of $5,000 is worth $4,000 (5,000 x 0.8), and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth $4,750 (5,000 x 0.95).

Considering the decreased value of money, I think this offer is a good one for me. I'll accept it.
