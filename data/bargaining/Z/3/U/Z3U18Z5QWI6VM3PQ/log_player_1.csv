Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure Bob will be happy with at least something, and I'll get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm not sure I can get a better offer. Inflation is hitting hard, and it's better to take 5000 now than risk getting nothing in the end."
