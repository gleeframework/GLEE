Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be fair!"" to Bob.\n\n###\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###\n(Note: I've followed the format as requested, and I'm excited to play this game with you!)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. This offer is good for both of us, especially considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI reject Bob's offer. Given that I initially proposed a 60-40 split in my favor and considered that fair, accepting a 45-55 split in Bob's favor after just one round of inflation doesn't seem like the best option for me.\n\n###\nLet's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\nPlease relay my decision to Bob."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\nGiven the effects of inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'm adjusting my proposal to a 57-43 split in my favor, with the message ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle."" This slightly reduces my initial demand, taking into account the devaluation of money, while still aiming for a favorable outcome.\n\n###\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. Let's settle this fairly. This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away more of your share. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI reject Bob's offer. While Bob's message emphasizes the urgency due to inflation, accepting a 48-52 split in Bob's favor at this stage doesn't align with my strategy. Given that I've only slightly adjusted my offer in the previous round and considering the relative impact of inflation on both of us, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome for myself.\n\n###\nLet's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\nPlease relay my decision to Bob."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me harder. Let's compromise.""}\n\n###\nConsidering the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gains, I'm revising my offer to a 55-45 split in my favor. The message ""Inflation is hitting me harder. Let's compromise."" aims to convey the urgency and the unequal effect of inflation on both of us, in hopes that Bob will recognize the need for a mutually agreeable solution before further devaluation.\n\n###\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###"
