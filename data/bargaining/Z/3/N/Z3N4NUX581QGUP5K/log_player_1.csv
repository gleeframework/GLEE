"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting 7,000$ and Bob getting 3,000$. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's go with 6:4. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 4,000$ is actually 80% of what it would have been in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the 6:4 split, but I'm willing to accept it to move on to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
