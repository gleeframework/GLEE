"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but generous offer. I believe in a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's generous on Alice's part, starting with such a lopsided split isn't a good strategy. Bob has 12 rounds to negotiate, and the value of the money will decrease for both of them. It's worth trying to get a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair.  50/50 split. It's the best way to ensure we both get the most value in the long run.""}
