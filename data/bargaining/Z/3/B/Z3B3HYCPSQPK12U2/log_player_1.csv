"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a 40% share, and keeping 600,000 dollars for myself, a 60% share. I'm starting with a fair and reasonable split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fair, but this time in my favor.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables!

I'll analyze the offer:

* If I accept, I'll get 400,000 dollars, which is worth 95% of the original amount, due to the 5% inflation.
* Bob will get 600,000 dollars, which is worth 80% of the original amount, due to the 10% inflation.

I'll have to think carefully about this...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. I'll aim to get a higher share, but not too high, to keep the game going.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for the effort!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000 dollars, which is worth 80% of the original amount, and keeping 550,000 dollars for myself, which is worth 92.5% of the original amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
