Round 4

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, but especially for Bob.  Every round that passes makes the potential gains less appealing.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting Bob's offer means risking getting a worse deal in Round 5, where the value of the money will have decreased even further.
* **Bob's Finality:** Bob has stated this is his final offer. While he could technically make another offer in Round 5, it's likely he's drawing a line in the sand.

Accepting 45% of a shrinking pie is better than potentially ending up with an even smaller slice or nothing at all."
