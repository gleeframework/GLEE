This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:**  The constant inflation is killing my potential gains. Waiting any longer means accepting even less.
* **Alice is Ruthless:** She seems content to let inflation eat away at my share, hoping I'll panic and take a worse deal. 
* **Something is Better than Nothing:** 45 dollars is significantly less than what I was aiming for, but it's better than walking away with nothing if the game continues and inflation gets even worse."
