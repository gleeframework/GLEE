"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not budging!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a warning to Bob that I'm not willing to negotiate too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $380,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth $480,000.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but it's a decent offer. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, aren't you?""
