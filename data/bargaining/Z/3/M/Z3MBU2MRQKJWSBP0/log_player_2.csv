Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, aren't you?

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still hoping for a better deal.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm going to hold out for a better split."
