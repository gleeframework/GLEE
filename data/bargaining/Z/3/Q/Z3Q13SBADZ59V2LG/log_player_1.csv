Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is ticking and we're both losing money.  This is a reasonable offer, slightly better for me but still fair for both. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's still not favorable.  We're early enough in the game to hold out for a better deal. Bob will feel the pressure of the decreasing pot and may offer a larger share soon."
