I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to take a smaller share in the hopes of getting more in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I'm hoping Bob will see that rejecting my offer is not a good strategy if he wants to get any money at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept this offer yet. While Bob is getting closer to a fair deal, I'm still hoping he will offer me a larger share.  I think I have leverage because if we don't reach an agreement, we both lose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. I think this offer is fair, and I hope Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept. If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we're both going to end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. I think we're both getting closer to a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will come around to a more even split in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. The clock is ticking, and we need to reach an agreement soon or we'll both lose. This offer is fair, and I hope Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I appreciate Bob getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm not ready to accept his offer yet. We have only a few rounds left and I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. I'm confident that we can find a solution that benefits us both."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 5500 and offering Bob 4500. I'm getting closer to a 50/50 split and think this is a fair deal given the limited time remaining."
