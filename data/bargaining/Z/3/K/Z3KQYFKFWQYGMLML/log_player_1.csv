Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money into two parts, with me receiving $600,000 and you receiving $400,000. This offers a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 550000 to me, and 450000 to you. This is a fair compromise given the diminishing value of money for me in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
