"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a ""fair"" starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  Since the money is worth less each round, I'm motivated to try and negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split, with me taking 60%, is a more equitable way to start. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me halfway at 55-45, a compromise! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'll accept this offer.  While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. A 55-45 split is a reasonable compromise, and it's better than risking it all for a few extra dollars."
