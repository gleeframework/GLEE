"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split, with me taking 60%, is a more equitable way to start. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll adjust the offer accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 40% share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 60% yet, let's try to find a better split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the total amount is now worth $8,000 for me and $9,500 for Bob (assuming Bob's gain is worth 5% less than the original $6,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway at 55-45, a compromise!""
}
```"
