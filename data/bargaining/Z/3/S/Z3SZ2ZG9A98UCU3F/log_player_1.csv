"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's offer is still 40% more than my initial offer, I'm inclined to reject it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 will be:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}"
