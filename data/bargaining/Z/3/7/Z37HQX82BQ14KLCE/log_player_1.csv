"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the bigger share""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and leave Bob with $20. My message to Bob is to consider this as a fair split, with me taking the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the loss of value, let's split it 45:55 to compensate for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'd rather not accept a 45:55 split. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's offer was 45:55, I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you get 40. Let's settle on this""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leave Bob with $40. My message to Bob is to consider this a reasonable compromise, given the initial rejection of my first offer and Bob's subsequent offer."
