"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given the inflation factor. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money loses 20% value for me in each round, so I need to make the most of it!)"
