Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think he's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less now, and I'm not willing to settle for only $2,000. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
