"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $100,000, and I'll take the rest. It's a good starting point, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a relatively small amount to start, but still a decent chunk of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  Fair is fair, and we both get a good chunk. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure I want to give up so much control over the division of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes that into account. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round. I'll take $700,000, and you'll get $300,000. It's a good compromise, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a smaller share, but it's still a decent chunk of the money, and I'm hoping he'll accept it to move forward."
