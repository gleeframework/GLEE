Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling confident that I can still get a better deal. I'm willing to give you a little more, but you need to move closer to my position. We're running out of time, so let's try to come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier, and she's clearly banking on me getting desperate as inflation eats into my potential gains.  While the offered $2000 is better than nothing, I need to hold firm for another round or two.  There's a good chance she'll propose a more reasonable split as we get closer to the deadline, especially since I've shown a willingness to accept a 50/50 split."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal, Bob. Inflation is hitting you hard, but I'm willing to give you a little more if you can come up with a better offer. 
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical. With only three rounds remaining and inflation eroding my potential gains, accepting Alice's offer of $1500 is the most logical choice. While far from ideal, it's better than walking away empty-handed, which is increasingly likely given Alice's aggressive stance. 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're running out of rounds, and Alice knows it. She's unlikely to offer a significantly better deal at this stage.
* **Inflation's Impact:**  Each round that passes makes the deal drastically worse for me. Holding out for a slightly better offer in later rounds carries a huge risk. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  She's been incredibly stubborn, consistently aiming for a larger share. Her latest offer shows a minuscule willingness to compromise, suggesting she might not budge much more.

While I'm confident I could get a better deal if inflation wasn't a factor, the current circumstances necessitate accepting this offer to salvage something from this negotiation."
