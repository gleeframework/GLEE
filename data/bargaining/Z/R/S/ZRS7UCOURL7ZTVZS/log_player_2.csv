"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer seems unfair in the long run. While I would get less initially, the inflation heavily impacts Alice. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Your money will be worth significantly less soon. This offer ensures you get a larger share while it still holds value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to recognize the impact of inflation, but this offer is still not advantageous for me.  I need to push for a larger share before the money loses too much value for her, making a deal unlikely."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly.  This ensures we both benefit before inflation erodes too much value.""}
