Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you hard, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While my buying power decreases, hers remains the same. It's getting riskier, but I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting 44 now is a terrible outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly and call it a day. This inflation is hurting us both.""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming a significant factor. While a 50/50 split might seem like I'm conceding, it's the safest option to guarantee a reasonable amount, especially as we approach the halfway point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take this before it gets worse 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but she's still trying to take advantage. I need to hold my ground. The inflation is a factor, but accepting a deal out of fear will only lead to a worse outcome. There's still time for a better deal, and I need to show Alice I'm not going to be pushed around by her tactics."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Okay, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point and the inflation is going to steadily erode my potential gains.  I need to signal that I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal. Offering 48 is still more than her previous offer of 43, but it also shows I'm willing to compromise slightly to avoid walking away with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, this is a good deal 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but with only 3 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is very high. Accepting 41 now, while far from ideal, is better than the increasing likelihood of ending up with nothing if Alice continues her current strategy."
