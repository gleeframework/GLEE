"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, knowing Bob's money will depreciate faster than mine. I'll see if he takes it or tries to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and although my money is worth the same as before, I can hold out for a better deal. If I reject, I'll be able to make the offer in the next round and get a better deal since his money will depreciate even more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but leaving a small amount for Bob to incentivize him to accept. His money is worth even less now, so he may see this as a good deal despite the vast difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round.  Even though his money is depreciating quickly, his offer is still substantial, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. It's time to take the deal and secure some of the money."
