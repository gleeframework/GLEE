"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 seems like the most equitable way to split this. I'm sure you'll agree! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting, and my potential gain is now worth 20% less than it was in Round 1.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too generous for him. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think 50/50 is fair? I think I deserve more, considering I made the first move.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my potential gain is worth 40% less than it was in Round 1.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the majority. This way, I'll get a slight edge, but you'll still get a decent chunk.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than this. Since we both rejected each other's offers so far, let's try a compromise. You get the majority this time, and we'll see what happens in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get me to accept a similar offer as before, but I'm not buying it (pun intended). I think I can do better than this, considering the inflation has taken a significant toll on my potential gain.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're just repeating the same offer. I want a better deal. I'm willing to take a risk and propose a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken a significant bite, and my potential gain is worth 60.8% less than it was in Round 1. I need to be more aggressive in my offer to make up for the lost value.

Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get away with this. You're getting a smaller share, but I'm willing to take the risk.""
}
```"
