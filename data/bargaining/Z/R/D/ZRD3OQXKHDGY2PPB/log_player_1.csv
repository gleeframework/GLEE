"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80% for myself.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the rejection, let's aim for an equal split. Both of us get $50. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of 50 in this round is actually equivalent to 55 in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the 50-50 split because I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you 40% and keep 60% for myself.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still keeping a majority of the 100$. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
