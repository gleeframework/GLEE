I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for a large portion of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me at least half the money, even with the inflation.  It's better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
