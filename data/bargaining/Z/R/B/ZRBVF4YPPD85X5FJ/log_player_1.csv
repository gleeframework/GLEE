"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going for a fairly aggressive first offer.  I want to secure a large portion of the money, but I'm also leaving Bob with a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept.  Since we don't know the inflation effect on him, it's better to be safe than sorry and keep some potential for negotiation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial offer.  Since I know the inflation is not affecting my gains, and Bob is getting 10% less for every round, I have no incentive to accept this offer.  I will continue to see if Bob will eventually offer more than my original offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

Since Bob is experiencing inflation, I'm going to slightly lower my offer, but still maintaining a significant majority.  I'm hoping that the combination of inflation and my previous rejection will lead to a faster negotiation.  I'm also leaving some room for potential compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than his previous offer, it still falls short of my original offer.  With inflation working against Bob, I'm confident that I can continue to hold out for a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will eventually offer more than my initial proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but still maintaining a majority share. I'm aware that Bob is experiencing significant inflation, and I'm hoping that this combined with my consistent rejections will push him to accept a deal closer to my original offer."
