Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain of $4000 in the first round is now equivalent to $3200 in value. This offer from Bob is slightly more generous than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $3200 in the second round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $2560. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

  ""bob_gain"": 6800

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less, my gain of $3200 in the first round is now equivalent to $1680 in value. Considering the current offer, I'll compare it to my previous gains in terms of their original value.

The current offer is worth more than my previous offer in terms of original value, so I'll accept it.
