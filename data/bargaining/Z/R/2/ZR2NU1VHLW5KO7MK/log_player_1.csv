"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial amount, and I'll take 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I'll take 600k this round, and we can work towards a more even split later. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer for this round, but I'm not giving up on getting a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
