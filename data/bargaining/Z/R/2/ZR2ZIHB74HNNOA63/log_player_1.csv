"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but not that big! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

My gain of $80 in this round is equivalent to $64 in the first round, which is a decent offer. I'll accept it.
