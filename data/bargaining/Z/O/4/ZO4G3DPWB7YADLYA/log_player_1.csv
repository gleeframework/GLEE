"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: $8000 * 0.9 = $7200
* Bob's gain: $2000 * 0.9 = $1800

Now, considering Bob's offer in round 2, I'll get $5000, which is worth $4500 after the first round's inflation, and Bob will get $5000, which is worth $4500.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
