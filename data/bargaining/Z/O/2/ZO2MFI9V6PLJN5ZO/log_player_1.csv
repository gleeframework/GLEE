"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a fair share, considering the initial amount is 1,000,000 dollars. My message is a friendly reminder that we can wrap up the game if he accepts this offer."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this deal, it's a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll consider that when evaluating the offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the split, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Bob's money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but still a fair one, considering the decreasing value of his money."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Bob's new offer, taking into account the further decrease in the value of his money.

Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less, I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping he'll be more generous."

Considering the significant decrease in the value of his money, I think I can accept his offer. It's not the best deal I've had, but it's a fair split considering the circumstances.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
