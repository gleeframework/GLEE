"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 70/30. How about a 60/40 split? It's still a decent compromise considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
