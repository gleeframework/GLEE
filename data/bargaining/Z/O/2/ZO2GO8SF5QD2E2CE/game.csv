7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the money in a 70/30 ratio. This seems fair given the risk of inflation over the 12 rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
6000.0,4000.0,I think we can do better than 70/30. How about a 60/40 split? It's still a decent compromise considering the risk of inflation.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
