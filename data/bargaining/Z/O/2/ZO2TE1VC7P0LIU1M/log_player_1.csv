"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but I'm willing to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 30-70 split, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and try to find a compromise. This is a fair split, and we can revisit if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
