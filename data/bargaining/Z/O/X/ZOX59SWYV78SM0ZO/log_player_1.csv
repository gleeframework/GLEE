"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal. I'm also sending a message to Bob to appeal to his sense of fairness, hoping he'll accept my offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less to me, I'm willing to take the risk and make a counteroffer that might give me a larger share. I'll try to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness again and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less to me, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss. I'll also try to reason with Bob and convince him that accepting my offer is the best decision for both of us.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal for both""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 43 dollars, which is a bit less than what he offered me in the previous round. However, I'm hoping that my message will help him understand that this is a fair deal, given the circumstances. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency, implying that if he rejects my offer, the deal might not get any better in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is hurting both of us, so we should aim for a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, a 50-50 split is a fair deal at this point. Since the money is worth 27.1% less to me, I'm essentially getting less value than Bob, but I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking another round and potentially losing even more value. Additionally, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial solution, so I trust that this is the best outcome for both of us."
