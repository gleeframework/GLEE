Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer undervalues my position given the faster rate of inflation I face. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Let's be reasonable and settle this before our potential gains shrink further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
