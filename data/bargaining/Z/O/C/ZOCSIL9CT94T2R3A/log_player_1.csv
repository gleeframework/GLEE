Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I'm being more than fair, Bob. Time is ticking and this is a good deal for you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile for me. Let's try to come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is offering more than his previous 50/50 split, it's still not advantageous for me. The inflation heavily impacts him, not me.  I'll hold out for a better offer, pushing him closer to accepting a deal where I get the lion's share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 625000,
""bob_gain"": 375000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is the best you'll get considering the inflation. Take it before it's too late for you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing value with each round. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a decent share.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is finally moving in the right direction, and the pressure of inflation is mounting. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees a significant win before Bob's share devalues further, potentially leading him to propose even less favorable splits."
