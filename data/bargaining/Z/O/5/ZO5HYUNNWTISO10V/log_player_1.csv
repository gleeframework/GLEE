"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to this fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too generous, I'll take a larger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a larger share!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 285,000 (300,000 * 0.95)
* Bob gain: 665,000 (700,000 * 0.95)

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 300,000. This is a fair split, considering the initial 50/50 proposal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and getting a fair share, while also considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I still think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 14.26% less than the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 256,500 (350,000 * 0.726)
* Bob gain: 630,500 (650,000 * 0.726)

I'm not happy with this offer. Bob is still trying to take a larger share, and I'm not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you a larger share than this. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation and our previous discussions.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and getting a fair share, while also considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, I think I deserve the majority of the money now! 
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 22.62% less than the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 220,800 (280,000 * 0.785)
* Bob gain: 668,800 (720,000 * 0.785)

I'm not happy with this offer at all. Bob is trying to take an even larger share, and I'm not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal. The decreasing value of money due to inflation is making it even more difficult for me to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you the majority of the money, Bob. I think this is the last chance for a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to be firm and hold my ground, while also leaving room for a compromise. I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to a more balanced split."
