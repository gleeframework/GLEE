Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a proposal that favors me slightly.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair and ensures I get something.  Given the risk of inflation, I don't want to risk getting nothing."
