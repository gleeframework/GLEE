Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, hoping to make the offer more attractive while still keeping a significant portion. This is a gamble, as Bob has shown he's willing to be aggressive, but I need to start securing some of the money before inflation erodes it further."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is still being very aggressive, but I'm not willing to accept such a low share.  I need to try and push for a better deal before inflation makes the money worth even less."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

Bob is still holding out for a large share, but I'm determined to get a better deal. I'm confident that with each round, the increasing inflation will make my offer more enticing to him."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

With each round, inflation is becoming more significant for Bob.  I'm reducing my share once more, hoping that this will finally convince him to accept. The risk is that I may be forced to accept a much lower share in the coming rounds if he continues to be stubborn."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still clinging to a large share, but the inflation is starting to really hit him now. I need to hold out for a better deal.  I'm confident that in the next few rounds, the pressure of inflation will force him to make a more reasonable offer."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is starting to affect Bob significantly now, and I'm running out of time. This offer is a 50/50 split, and it's the best I can offer without risking getting nothing at all. If Bob continues to be stubborn, I may be forced to accept an even lower share in the remaining rounds."
