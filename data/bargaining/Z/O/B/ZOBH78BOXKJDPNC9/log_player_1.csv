"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, my gain of $5000 is worth 90% of the first-round gain, so it's actually $4500 in value.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with meeting in the middle, as it seems like I'd be giving up some of my potential gain. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with meeting in the middle. Can we try to adjust the split?""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, my gain of $4500 is worth 90% of the second-round gain, so it's actually $4050 in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, my gain of $4500 is worth 73.9% of the first-round gain, so it's actually $7300 in value.

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as he's trying to take a larger share of the remaining money. I'd like to try to negotiate further and get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think you deserve a larger share this time. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
