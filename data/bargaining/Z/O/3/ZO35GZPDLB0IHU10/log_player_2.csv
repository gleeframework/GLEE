"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to negotiate if you think it's unfair. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I need to be strategic about when to accept an offer. Alice's initial offer of 1000 for me and 9000 for her seems too skewed in her favor, especially considering the decreasing value of money for me. I'll reject this offer and propose a more balanced division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for me. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll aim for a more substantial share to compensate for the loss.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant portion to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nAnother round, another offer from Alice. Considering the inflation, my share of 4000 is actually worth less than it would have been in the initial round. However, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus proceeding to the next round.

Given that the money is worth 36% less for me now, and it will continue to decrease in value, I should consider accepting this offer. However, I'll also think about the potential benefits of making another counteroffer.

After careful consideration, I've decided to...
