"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a fair share of $5,000 each, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now, even if it's not a 50/50 split. And Bob's offer is a significant improvement over my previous offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
