Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the one making the offer this round. I expect Bob to accept, as he will get $10 for free."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I get $20, it's worth less due to inflation. I will take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
``` 

I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  While inflation has affected the value of the money, I'm hoping Bob will recognize that rejecting again will result in an even lower payout for him in the next round."
