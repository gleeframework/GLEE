"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'll reject it for now, hoping to get a better deal.

}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob offered me 40% of the total in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. With the inflation affecting Bob's gain even more significantly, I'll consider this offer a relatively good one. I'll accept it.
