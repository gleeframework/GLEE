"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, it heavily favors her. The inflation rate works against me more than it does against her. It's better to take a chance on getting a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share Alice, but the inflation hits me harder. This offer is more balanced considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking Initiative:** By making a counter-offer, Bob takes control of the negotiation.
* **Addressing Inflation:**  The message directly addresses the elephant in the room â€“ the unequal inflation rates. This justifies Bob asking for a slightly larger share.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While Bob is aiming for a better deal than Alice's initial offer, he's not being overly aggressive.  This could encourage Alice to negotiate rather than simply rejecting outright. 
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases. It's in Bob's best interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a counter-offer. We need to reach an agreement soon before inflation eats away our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation. Her offer now favors Bob slightly compared to her initial proposal.
* **Time is Money:**  While the offer isn't ideal, waiting any longer significantly risks getting even less due to the rapidly decreasing value. 
* **Better Than Nothing:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a good chance the negotiations could break down entirely, leaving him with nothing.  

It's a tough call, but accepting ensures Bob gets a reasonable share before inflation erodes the value further."
