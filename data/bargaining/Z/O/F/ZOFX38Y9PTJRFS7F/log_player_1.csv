"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and give Bob 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In the first round, I would have taken 60 dollars, but now that's equivalent to 54 dollars in the second round (60 * 0.9). So, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer.
