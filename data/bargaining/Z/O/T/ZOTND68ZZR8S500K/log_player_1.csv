"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as the money will be worth more to me in the long run due to the inflation affecting Bob more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
``` 

I'm reducing my share slightly to 85% hoping to make a deal. While the money is worth less to Bob with each round, it's still a significant difference for him, so I think this is a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is getting increasingly greedy. I need to try and salvage some of this money, even if it means risking getting nothing.  I'll continue to reject his offers and see if I can counter with something he might accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm willing to drop my share to 70% to try and secure a deal before things get even more out of whack.  I'm hoping Bob sees that it's in his best interest to accept, as he's losing a considerable amount of his potential gains with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still holding out. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal for myself in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, hoping to find a compromise before the inflation completely decimates Bob's potential gains.  At this point, 60% is the minimum I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still not fair. I'm going to keep rejecting these offers and try to secure a better deal for myself. I'm confident I can get at least 50% of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

We're getting close to the end now, and I'm willing to reduce my share to 55% to try and get a deal done. Bob's potential gains are shrinking rapidly, and it's in his best interest to accept this offer before he loses even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky, but I'm accepting this 50/50 split. Bob's offers are getting closer to my proposals and it's likely that we will both get nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers. It's time to settle for a decent outcome."
