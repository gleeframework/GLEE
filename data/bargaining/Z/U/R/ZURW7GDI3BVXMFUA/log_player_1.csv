"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you get 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering we both have an equal chance to propose in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to propose my own offer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more since the money is worth less now. This way, I'll take 55 and you get 45.""}

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 55/45.  This way we can both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise, considering the reduced value of the money. A 45-55 split is not ideal, but it's better than the 40-60 split Bob proposed earlier. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation."
