"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but still leave you with a decent share.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to accept yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the money is worth less now. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, considering the decreasing value of money.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more equal distribution of the remaining $100."
