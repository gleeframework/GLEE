"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even though it's a good offer now, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. Remember, the money is worth less for me with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Alice. It's a fair offer, and we both get a good share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing, Bob. Let's settle this now with a slight advantage for me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

The money I'm getting is worth less and less with each round. I'll take the offer now, even with the smaller share."
