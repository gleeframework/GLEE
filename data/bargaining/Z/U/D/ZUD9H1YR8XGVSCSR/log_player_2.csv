"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While it seems like a decent amount now, the inflation will hit her much harder than me. It's worth seeing what kind of offer I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but my turn now.  This offer considers the inflation we both face.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the Lead:** I'm taking the initiative to steer the negotiation in a direction more favorable to me.
* **Acknowledging Alice:** By mentioning her desire for a larger share, I show that I'm considering her position, even if I don't fully agree with it.
* **Inflation Factor:** The message subtly highlights the inflation, reminding Alice that accepting a smaller amount now might be better than risking a worse deal later. 
* **Not Too Greedy:** While I aim for a larger share, I'm not being overly aggressive. A 60/40 split is a strong opening move, leaving room for negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but it's doing so very slowly. At this rate, the inflation will eat away at my potential gains before we reach a deal that truly benefits me. 
* **Leveraging Inflation:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, evident in her message and slightly improved offer.  This means my strategy of waiting is working.
* **Aiming Higher:** I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to reject and signal that I'm willing to wait. The longer this goes on, the more desperate Alice will become to make a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice. This offer is fair and gives us both something. Let's be sensible and end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:** I'm increasing the pressure on Alice by emphasizing the shrinking pot due to inflation. The message uses ""time is ticking"" and ""let's be sensible"" to create a sense of urgency.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm slightly lowering my demand from 60% to around 55%, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but still maintaining a position of advantage.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** This offer aims to be attractive enough for Alice to accept, considering her losses from inflation, while still securing a significant portion of the money for myself."
