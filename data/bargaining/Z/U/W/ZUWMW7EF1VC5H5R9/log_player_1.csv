"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3 to start, and we can reassess if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. I'm framing it as a starting point, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a 7:3 ratio, I'm offering a 9:1 ratio. Is this more to your liking? 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The ratio has shifted significantly in Bob's favor!

I'm not thrilled about the 9:1 ratio, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about whether I'd rather accept this offer or risk going into another round.

I'll reject the offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle with a 5.5:4.5 split, and we can avoid further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 5.5:4.5 split, which is closer to a 50/50 split than the previous offers. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You proposed a 5.5:4.5 split, I'm offering a 6:4 split. Meet me in the middle, but with a slightly more favorable ratio for me 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced values, I'm not thrilled about the 6:4 split, but I'm willing to accept it. The reduced values make me more cautious, and I don't want to risk going into another round.

I'll accept the offer.
