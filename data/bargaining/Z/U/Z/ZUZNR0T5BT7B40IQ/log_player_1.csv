"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $480,000 (60% of $800,000). Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he'd be getting $630,000 (70% of $900,000).

I'm not sure I like the 70-30 split. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground with a 55-45 split. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but not there yet 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Let's calculate the actual values: my gain is worth 48.8% less than the original $600,000, so I'd be getting $311,040 (60% of $517,000). Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than the original $400,000, so he'd be getting $291,800 (70% of $416,500).

I'm not sure I like this offer. It's a 55-45 split, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject the offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Split it down the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a 50-50 split, which seems fair considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
