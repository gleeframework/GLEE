"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'm willing to give you a decent share. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is worth 90% of the original $8,000, which is $7,200.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
