Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer gives me a comfortable 60% and hopefully will be seen as a fair starting point by Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, taking 45% now is better than risking getting nothing in the next round. Inflation is a factor, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal later."
