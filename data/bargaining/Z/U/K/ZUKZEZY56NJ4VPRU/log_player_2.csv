Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should accept, it's only going to get worse for you! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains too!""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your money is losing value fast, don't wait! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's painful, but at this point, the inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. Accepting a 3000 split is better than risking even less in further rounds."
