"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want the majority of the money.  Accept this, or we both risk getting less in the next round!

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice is offering a higher gain than the previous round, it is still less than the 450,000 I initially offered.  There's still time to try for a better split."
