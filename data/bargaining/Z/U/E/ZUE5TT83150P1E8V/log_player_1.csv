"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the total amount. This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual values as follows:

My gain: 400,000 / 0.9 = 444,444.44 (due to 10% less)
Bob's gain: 600,000 / 0.8 = 750,000 (due to 20% less)

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Considering the effects of inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000 dollars, which is 45% of the total amount. This way, I get 55% and Bob gets 45%."
