"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get a slightly better deal since I'm the first one to make an offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering the 12 rounds we have to work with. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move by Bob! Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round to make a new offer, trying to take into account the inflation effect on the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for a 60-40 split? I'll give you a 54-46 split, a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 460,000$ and keeping 540,000$ for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
