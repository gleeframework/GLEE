"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering you $20, and I'll take $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd rather not give away as much as I did in the first round. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
