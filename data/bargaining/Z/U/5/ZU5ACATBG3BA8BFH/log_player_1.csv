# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I want to try to get a better deal. Bob's offer is not significantly better for me than my initial offer, and I think I can get a more favorable split if I hold out. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
