55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. My offer is still generous considering the inflation is hitting me harder.  55/45 is my final offer.",Alice,3,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to 60/40 to make this worthwhile for me with the inflation.  Let's try 65/35, and we can both still come out ahead.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The inflation is hurting both of us.  Let's split 50/50 and end this now before we both lose out.",Alice,5,

30.0,70.0,"Alice, this is getting serious. We're both losing money with each round.  Let's meet in the middle at 70/30. This is my final offer, and I think it's fair considering the inflation.",Bob,6,
