"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but not that big 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll need to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to aim for an even better split. I'm not convinced that 60 is a good enough share for me, especially considering the reduced value of money due to inflation. I'd like to propose my own offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 65-35 split, which I believe is a fair compromise, taking into account the reduced value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the value of money is decreasing rapidly. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise, especially since we're getting close to the deadline.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. It's a fair compromise, and I'd rather take this offer than risk waiting for a better one that might not come."
