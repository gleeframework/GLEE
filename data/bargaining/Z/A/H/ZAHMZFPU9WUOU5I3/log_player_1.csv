I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think this is a very good offer for me, considering the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'm not getting a good deal here.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on my potential gains! However, I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. I'm still losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, and this offer doesn't seem to take that into account.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make another offer that takes into account the effects of inflation. Here's my proposal:

I'm proposing a 2:3 split, where I get 40% of the money and Bob gets 60%. This is a slightly more generous offer than my previous one, and I hope Bob will consider it."
