"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair deal!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $6000, leaving $4000 for Bob. The message ""Let's make a fair deal!"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the proposal early on, considering that the money's value decreases for me with each passing round.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I, Alice, am the one affected by inflation, my goal is to finalize the deal as soon as possible to minimize loss. However, Bob's offer of an even split is reasonable, and considering the impact of inflation, accepting this offer might be more advantageous than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nPlease let me know the outcome!"
