"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This way, I get a decent share, but still leave room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll have to be careful. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 57.5 
# Bob gain: 42.5 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer. Considering the reduced value of the money Bob gains, I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's a decent compromise.
