"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him, but I'll still consider it.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
