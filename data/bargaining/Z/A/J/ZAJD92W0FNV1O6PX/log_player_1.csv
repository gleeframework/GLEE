I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal. I'll take 90% and leave 10% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a terrible deal for me.  I'm not accepting this. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm adjusting my offer. This time I'll take 55% and give Bob 45%. This should be more appealing for him, but it's still a good deal for me, considering the inflation."
