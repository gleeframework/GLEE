"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront as the value decreases faster for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a risky move, but it's worth it to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further.  The initial offer seems unfair, and it's likely she'll lower her demand to secure a deal before the value of the money drops too drastically for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, but also efficient. I'm taking a bit more this time to compensate for the inflation hitting me harder. We can finish this quickly and still get a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is literally money! Let's wrap this up. I'm taking a bit more to reflect the urgency. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to capitalize on the pressure of time and the decreasing value of money. While the offer is tempting, it still feels unfair. I'm going to hold out and see if she's willing to compromise further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with every round. I'm willing to split it 45/55, a compromise that gives you a bit more to account for your higher inflation rate, but still allows us both to walk away with something substantial.  Let's end this before we both lose too much.""}
