Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take a smaller share this time, but you'll get more.  We can keep things moving! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Okay, let's split the difference. 60/40 - it's a fair deal!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time for an even split! We both get a good amount, and we can avoid any more back and forth. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, inflation is working against Bob. Accepting now means he's losing out on potential gains he could secure by pushing for a slightly better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""How about we meet in the middle?  55/45 seems like a fair compromise.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, let's get this done. You get a little more, but I'm not going to budge anymore. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has repeated her offer from Round 6, indicating she's unlikely to budge further.  While Bob would prefer a 60/40 split, accepting 55/45 now is better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing as inflation continues to erode his potential gains."
