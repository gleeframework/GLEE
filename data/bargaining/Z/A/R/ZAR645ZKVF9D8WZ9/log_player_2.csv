Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation's Impact:**  The inflation rates are significant, making it unlikely that Alice will offer anything significantly better in future rounds.
* **Current Offer:** While the offer is significantly lower than the initial 1000, it's still a gain, and the discounted value is likely higher than any future offer considering inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting the offer risks getting a worse deal in the future. Accepting ensures some gain despite the inflation."
