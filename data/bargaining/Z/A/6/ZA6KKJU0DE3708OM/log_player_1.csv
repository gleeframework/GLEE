"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to get a better deal next time! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of $30 is now worth 5% less, which is $28.40. I'm not happy with this offer, but I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal this time!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 55% of the initial $100, which is $55. I'm keeping 45% for myself, which is $45. I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be more generous, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my share in this round. In the first round, my share was $60. Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, which is a reduction of $8.58. So, my share of $60 is now worth $51.42.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'm being offered only $20, which is worth $17.71 in real value. I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.
