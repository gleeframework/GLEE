Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm essentially getting $4,750 (5000 - 5% of 5000).

Bob's offer is for me to get $4,000, which is a bit less than what I would have gotten in the first round. However, I'm also considering the fact that Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so he's actually getting $6,000, which is a bit more than he would have gotten in the first round.

After weighing the options, I decide to...
