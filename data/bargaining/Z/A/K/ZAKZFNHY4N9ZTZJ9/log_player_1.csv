"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to get a quick agreement and avoid any potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's be realistic! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rate, my gain of 30 is now worth 9% less than the original 50, and Bob's gain of 70 is now worth 16% less than the original 50.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.

For now, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Given the inflation rate, my gain will be worth 8% less than the original amount, and I need to take that into account when making my offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, hoping to get a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too soft on me, I'm the one taking the risk of inflation! 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Given that my gain of 15 is worth only 15% of the original 50, and Bob's gain of 85 is worth only 17% of the original 50, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

However, considering the significant difference in the proposed split and the fact that I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation, I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation rate is really eating into my potential earnings, and I need to be more aggressive in my offer.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money drops even further due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can smell it! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is really taking a toll on my potential earnings, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. With my gain of 10 being worth only 2% of the original 50, I'm getting close to the point where it's almost not worth playing the game.

However, I'll try to hold out for a better deal. I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to give in to Bob's pressure tactics, but I'll have to make a more aggressive offer next round to try to salvage what's left of the value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation rate is really ravaging the value of the money, and I need to make a bold move to try to get a decent share.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going down without a fight! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is my best chance to get a decent share of the remaining value before it's too late. I'm not leaving room for negotiation, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is really decimating the value of the money, and I'm running out of time. With my gain of 5 being worth only 1% of the original 50, I'm getting desperate.

However, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's a bad deal, I'm not sure if I can do better. The value of the money is dropping so rapidly that I'm not sure if I can afford to wait for a better offer.

Considering the extreme value difference and the fact that I'm almost out of rounds, I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not happy with the outcome, but I'll take the 5 dollars and hope that it's better than nothing."
