Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that inflation hurts me more than her.  She's barely budging from her initial offer, knowing that my options are getting worse over time. I need to hold firm and hope she starts taking my offers more seriously before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be real. I'm taking a hit from inflation, and this is the most equitable deal we're going to get.  50/50, take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Tide is Turning:**  Alice is playing a game of chicken, but the inflation is starting to become a significant factor.  She may be overplaying her hand.
* **Show Strength, But Be Reasonable:** By going to a true 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  This might be the wake-up call she needs. 
* **Limited Time:** We're past the halfway point. I need to apply more pressure before the inflation eats away too much of my potential gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Equitable? You're still getting a better deal than I am, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting tight! Alice is clearly very stubborn. Let's analyze:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're down to 6 rounds, and the inflation is getting worse with each one. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** She's banking on me cracking under pressure, but I need to show resolve.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While her offer isn't great, the difference between this offer and a potential future offer is shrinking due to inflation.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It pains me to take a deal worse than my last offer, but waiting any longer is too risky. Alice might not budge, and even if she offers a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the inflation will have eaten away at the difference. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing."
