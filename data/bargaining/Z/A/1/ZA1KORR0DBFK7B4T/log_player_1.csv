"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is still 6000, but Bob's gain is now worth 10% less than in the first round, so it's effectively 3600. Bob's new offer is 5000, which is more than 3600, so I'll accept it.
