"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since this is the first round, the money is at its full value for both of us.  I'm offering a generous share to Bob to encourage him to accept and avoid further rounds where the value of the money decreases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and by rejecting this offer, I risk getting nothing at all in future rounds.  It's better to take what I can get now."
