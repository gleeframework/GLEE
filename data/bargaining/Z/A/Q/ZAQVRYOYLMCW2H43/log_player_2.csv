"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's worth trying to get a better deal.  I'll see if I can get Alice to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is fairer, but we can talk about it.  Let's find a deal we're both happy with!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice is being stubborn and it's risky to keep rejecting offers. This is a good compromise, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal later."
