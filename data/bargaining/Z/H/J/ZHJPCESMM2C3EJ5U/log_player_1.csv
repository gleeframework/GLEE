"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then I can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give you too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $70 is worth 5% less than the $80 I could have gotten in the first round, so it's a slightly worse deal for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more after rejecting your previous offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $25, which is a slightly better deal for me than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money in Round 4, considering the cumulative inflation:

Original $100 → 95% (after Round 1) → 90.25% (after Round 2) → 86.0625% (after Round 3) → 74.06% (after Round 4)

So, in terms of the original value, my gain of $60 in Round 4 is equivalent to approximately $44.44.

Considering the value of the money, I think this offer is a bit better than my previous one, but still not enough for me. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $35, which is a slightly better deal for me than his previous offer."
