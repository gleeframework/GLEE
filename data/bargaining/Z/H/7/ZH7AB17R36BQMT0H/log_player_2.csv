Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing.  What do you say?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be reasonable here. Inflation is impacting us both.  A 50/50 split seems like the fairest option now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is fair, and with the inflation, things are only going to get worse."
