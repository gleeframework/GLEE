"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I have some leverage to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the 10% decrease in value for Alice and made an offer that slightly favors me, but still leaves her with a substantial amount. Let's see if she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll go up a bit. But this is the best I can do, Bob. We're both losing money with every round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that the money is worth the same for me but 19% less for Alice compared to the first round, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make another proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact on your end, I think this split is more reasonable now.""}\n\n###\n\nI've adjusted my offer to reflect the further decrease in value for Alice, aiming to capture a larger share while still presenting it as a fair deal given the circumstances. Let's see if Alice will accept this time."
