"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 7:3 split, which is a common ratio in many negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain remaining at 700,000, and the money Bob gains being worth 5% less, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
