Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a high-stakes strategy. I'll offer Bob a single dollar to see if he's willing to accept a minimal share. If he doesn't, I'll have the advantage of making the next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and I'd rather get half the money than risk getting nothing at all."
