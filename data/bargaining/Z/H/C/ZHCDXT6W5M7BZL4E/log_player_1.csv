"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 4:1 split in my favor is fair considering the inflation that will impact the value of the money in future rounds. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
