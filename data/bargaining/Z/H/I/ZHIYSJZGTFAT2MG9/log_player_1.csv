"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, leaving some room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, but I'm not satisfied with a 50/50 split. I'm going to try to get a better deal. Let's see how this plays out!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to propose a 7000/3000 split in my favor. Since I rejected his offer, I'm hoping I can get a better deal this time. It's still a reasonable offer, considering the inflation factor is starting to kick in.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still not convinced.  I'm holding out for a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm proposing a 6000/4000 split in my favor. It's a compromise from my previous offer and still gives me a significant portion of the money.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
