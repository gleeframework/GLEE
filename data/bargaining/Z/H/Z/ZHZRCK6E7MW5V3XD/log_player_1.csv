"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll get the smaller share this round, but I'm hoping to turn the tables later.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a 40% share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to make a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* My gain: $200,000 (as proposed)
* Bob's gain: $640,000 (80% of $800,000)

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too generous to Bob. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, the money is now worth 10% less than in the second round for me, and 20% less than in the second round for Bob.

Since my gain in the second round would have been $200,000, and it's worth 10% less now, my gain in the third round would be $180,000.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if we can make a deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give away too much. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values:

* My gain in the first round was $600,000, and it's worth 27.1% less now, so my gain in the fourth round would be approximately $437,400.
* Bob's gain in the fourth round is $550,000, which is 48.8% less than his gain in the first round ($800,000).

Considering the offer, I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too generous to Bob. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, my gain in the fourth round would be approximately $437,400.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway this round. Let's see if we can finally make a deal.""
}
