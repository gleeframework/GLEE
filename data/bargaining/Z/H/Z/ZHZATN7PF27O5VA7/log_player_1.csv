"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll calculate my gain accordingly:

$10,000 x 0.9 = $9,000 (initial value)
$9,000 x 0.9 = $8,100 (value after first round)
$8,100 x 0.9 = $7,290 (value after second round)

So, my gain in the second round would be $7,290.

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Splitting it down the middle is a bit too generous for me, I'd like to try for more.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, I'll calculate my gain accordingly:

$10,000 x 0.9 = $9,000 (initial value)
$9,000 x 0.9 = $8,100 (value after first round)
$8,100 x 0.9 = $7,290 (value after second round)
$7,290 x 0.9 = $6,561 (value after third round)

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to take a slightly larger share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 4:6 is a bit unfair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money for me after four rounds:

$10,000 x 0.9 = $9,000 (initial value)
$9,000 x 0.9 = $8,100 (value after first round)
$8,100 x 0.9 = $7,290 (value after second round)
$7,290 x 0.9 = $6,561 (value after third round)
$6,561 x 0.9 = $5,896.89 (value after fourth round)

So, my gain in the fourth round would be $5,896.89.

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 4:6 is a good split, but I'm willing to consider it. Can we try to find a middle ground?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, I'll calculate my gain accordingly:

$10,000 x 0.9 = $9,000 (initial value)
$9,000 x 0.9 = $8,100 (value after first round)
$8,100 x 0.9 = $7,290 (value after second round)
$7,290 x 0.9 = $6,561 (value after third round)
$6,561 x 0.9 = $5,896.89 (value after fourth round)
$5,896.89 x 0.9 = $5,300.401 (value after fifth round)

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise.""
