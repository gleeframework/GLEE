"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can shake hands!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to be more cautious since the money is worth less due to inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it 50/50 just yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best deal, but I'm willing to compromise. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going for the lowball, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take a closer look at Bob's new offer. Considering the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll be more willing to accept a smaller share.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like a decent compromise, and I'll take the $6,000."
