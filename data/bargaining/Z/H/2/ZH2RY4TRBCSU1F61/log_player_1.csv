"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer gives Alice a large share of the money, but it also leaves a small amount for Bob.  It is a risky move, but it might incentivize Bob to accept the offer rather than risk losing even more money in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it would be nice to get more, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a significant portion of the money.  The 5% inflation hit is a factor, but with only 10 rounds left, it's better to secure a large sum than risk losing it all."
