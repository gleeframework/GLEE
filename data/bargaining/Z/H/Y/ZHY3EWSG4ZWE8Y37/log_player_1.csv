Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor. I'm starting strong, but I want to leave room for negotiation if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  Given the inflation, my 95/5 split would be worth significantly less in the next round.  Accepting the 50/50 split ensures I get at least something, and it saves me the risk of further rounds and potential losses."
