"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the complications of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is better than what I was originally proposing, it's still not fair. Bob's gain is significantly higher than mine, and the inflation rate is going to make the situation even worse for me in the next round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This time, I'm aiming for a 60/40 split. It's a more equitable offer than the previous round, and with inflation biting into both our shares, it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still believe there's room for a fairer split. While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, he's still aiming for a significant portion of the money, and inflation is making this deal increasingly unfavorable for me. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000} 
```

This time, I'm proposing a near 50/50 split.  With the increasing inflation, it's becoming increasingly difficult to get a favorable outcome, but I still believe that this is a fair deal that will allow us both to end the game with a decent amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable, and the inflation is making the situation worse with each round. While I'm running out of time and options, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll try one last time to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

This is my final attempt. I'm willing to accept a 30/70 split, knowing that Bob has the upper hand due to the inflation. This offer is a compromise, but it's the best I can do under these circumstances."
