"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, don't you? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""How about we meet in the middle, Bob? This offer still gives you a significant share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking its toll on your share, Alice. I think it's time for me to take a bigger cut. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While the impact of inflation is becoming more significant, accepting this offer would mean a much smaller gain for me compared to Bob. It's worth taking a risk and seeing if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere, Bob. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Inflation is increasingly eating into my potential gains, and Bob seems unwilling to budge from his demands for a larger share. A 50/50 split is the fairest option and ensures I still walk away with a substantial amount before inflation further diminishes its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is really biting now, Alice. I think it's time for me to take an even bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This offer is getting worse! Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation situation. While it's painful to see my potential gains diminish, accepting this would be significantly worse than even an even split after inflation is considered. I need to try to push back, but I'm running out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out, and Bob is clearly playing hardball.  This offer gives him the majority share, but it's the best I'm willing to offer considering the circumstances. The ""final offer"" message adds pressure, hoping he'll realize accepting something is better than nothing as we get closer to the deadline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, Alice, but I'm not buying it. The inflation is crippling your share, and I think you'll take what you can get. I'll take three-quarters of a million, and you can have the rest. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting cocky and trying to strong-arm me.  He's betting I'll panic with only a few rounds left.  While 250,000 is a lot less than I hoped for, it's not worth accepting this terrible deal. I need to show I'm serious and willing to walk away. Maybe he'll reconsider in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Bob, you're right. I do need to take what I can get. This is my absolute final offer - don't regret not taking it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Time for a calculated risk. I'm matching his previous offer, making it clear this is the best he'll get. The strong language aims to make him think I'm at my limit, and he might lose everything if he pushes further. There's still a chance he'll try to negotiate down a little, but with only three rounds left, the risk is worth it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know you said that was your final offer, Alice, but I think you're desperate now. The inflation has destroyed your share, and I'm willing to take advantage of that. I'll take 80% of the money, and you can have the scraps. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a painful decision, but I have to be realistic.  Bob is clearly exploiting the situation and won't budge. Accepting this offer gives me $200,000, which is much better than nothing. If I reject this, he might offer even less next round, or I risk getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but it's the most logical choice at this point."
