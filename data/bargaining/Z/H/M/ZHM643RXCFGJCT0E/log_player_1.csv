"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think we can find a more agreeable split. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **Inflation is hurting us:**  With each round, the total value we can split decreases. It's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Bob's offer is getting worse:** His offer is now the reverse of what I proposed, and due to inflation, it's even less favorable than my original offer. 

I need to incentivize Bob to negotiate fairly, but time is working against us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, this deal is getting worse for both of us with every round. I'm willing to negotiate, but let's be realistic. This offer is fair and avoids further losses from inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:** I've reduced my share slightly from the original 55/45 split to 52/48. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept an unfair deal. 
* **Highlighting the urgency:** By emphasizing the negative impact of inflation for both of us, I hope to encourage Bob to settle quickly.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  While making a small concession, I'm still aiming for a larger share, reflecting the initial advantage I have due to the faster inflation on my end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's settle this now. This offer is a slight improvement for me, and while it's less than your initial proposal, it still gives you a sizable share before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With each round, the inflation is eroding the value of the money significantly.  It's getting dangerously close to a point where even a seemingly good deal won't be worth much.
* **Bob is negotiating:** While his offer is still tilted in his favor, he has moved slightly closer to my position from his original 55/45 demand.  This suggests he's feeling the pressure too. 
* **Taking the sure thing:**  Holding out for a better offer in the next round is very risky.  Bob might dig in, and even if I got my way in the end, the gains might be minimal compared to the losses from inflation. 

It's frustrating to not get my full initial ask, but in this scenario, securing a reasonable amount now is better than risking a worse outcome later."
