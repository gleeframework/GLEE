Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since the inflation is affecting your share more, I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get what I want. Let's try this split and see if we can agree.

# Alice gain: 570000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's acknowledging the impact of inflation on my share.  It's tempting to accept, but I think I can squeeze out a bit more. If I concede now, she'll know I'm getting desperate.  Time is money, but so is holding my ground a little longer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 435000,
""alice_gain"": 565000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a very reasonable offer given the circumstances. You get the majority, and we minimize further losses from inflation.  Let's be smart and close this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm nudging my offer up slightly to show flexibility and a willingness to compromise. Highlighting the ""reasonableness"" of the offer and emphasizing minimizing losses are tactics to make Alice more amenable to accepting. It's a balance between trying to get a slightly better deal and recognizing the increasing pressure from the shrinking pot."
