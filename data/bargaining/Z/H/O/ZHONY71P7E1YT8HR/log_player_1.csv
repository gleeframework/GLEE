"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I'm going to start with a very unbalanced offer. I think this will encourage Bob to accept quickly and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Bob's offer is just as unfair as mine, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I get to make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I'm going to propose an even split. It's fair and increases the chances of us both getting something."
