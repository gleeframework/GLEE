Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob is unlikely to offer anything better at this point.  Consider these factors:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is mounting. Delaying further significantly erodes the value of Alice's potential gains.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The inflation rate means every round makes the potential winnings less attractive for Alice. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently aimed for a larger share.  His ""fair"" offer now suggests he's unlikely to budge much further.

Accepting guarantees Alice a reasonable share, even after inflation. Rejecting risks getting a much smaller amount, or even nothing at all, as the game progresses."
