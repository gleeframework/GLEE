"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but it's still fair to Bob. Since it's the first round, I'm hoping he'll accept it.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me due to the inflation, even though he's taking a bigger hit. I'm going to reject this and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm lowering my share slightly to account for inflation, but I'm still offering a significant amount to Bob. I think it's a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping he'll accept it this time."

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm continuing to lower my share slightly to account for inflation, but I'm still offering a good amount to Bob.  With the inflation hitting him harder, I'm hoping this is enough to make him accept."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm continuing to lower my share a bit, but I'm still offering a majority of the money.  Inflation is starting to get really bad for Bob, so I think this might be a deal he can't refuse."
