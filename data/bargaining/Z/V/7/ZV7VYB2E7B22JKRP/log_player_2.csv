""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite low. I'm willing to be generous, but let's be realistic.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value of money with inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on inflation, but a 60/40 split is too much in your favor. Let's compromise. I'll take 65% and you can have 35%. This is a fairer split that considers the time value of money while still being reasonable.
