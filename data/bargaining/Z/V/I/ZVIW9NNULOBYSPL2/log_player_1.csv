Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split is the most sensible way to divide the money. We both get a good share, and we don't have to risk losing everything as the rounds go on. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
