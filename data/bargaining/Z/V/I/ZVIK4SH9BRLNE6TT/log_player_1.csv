"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, and see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, the actual amounts I'd gain are:

* Alice gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250
* Bob gain: 5000

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and it's better to settle now rather than risking further inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
