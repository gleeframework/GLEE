60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $60, you take $40.  It's important to reach a deal quickly due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think we should split it more evenly, considering the inflation affects you more than me.",Bob,2,
,,"That's not fair, Bob.  The inflation is significant, and your offer doesn't reflect that. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your point about an even split, but the inflation puts me at a disadvantage.  How about we meet in the middle?  $55 for me and $45 for you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
43.0,57.0,"Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still leaving you with a decent amount.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate the gesture, this offer still disproportionately impacts me due to the inflation.  We need to find a solution that accounts for the decreasing value of the money over time.",Alice,4,reject
53.0,47.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and the value is decreasing with each round. I'm offering you $47, which is a fair deal considering the circumstances.  Let's close this out.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"The inflation is really hurting your share, and I'm not feeling the same pressure. I think it's time for me to take a bigger cut.",Bob,6,
,,"Okay, Bob, I'll accept your offer. Let's finalize this before the inflation eats away at the value any further.",Alice,6,accept
