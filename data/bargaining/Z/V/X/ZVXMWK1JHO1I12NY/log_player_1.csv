"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I deserve a bit more""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to take $600,000, which is 60% of the total amount, and leave $400,000, or 40%, for Bob. The message attached to the proposal suggests that I believe I deserve a slightly larger share, framing it as a matter of fairness. This opening offer sets the stage for negotiations, allowing Bob to either accept the proposal or counteroffer in the next round. Given the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases with each round, there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, the differing rates of inflation for Alice and Bob (20% vs. 10%) may influence their strategies, potentially leading to more aggressive negotiations from Alice to counteract the greater loss in value she faces with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, I, Alice, choose to reject Bob's offer. Despite the even split suggested by Bob's message, the actual proposal gives Bob $600,000 and me $400,000, which is not an even split. Considering the impact of inflation, accepting this offer would mean I lose more value compared to the first round, and I might believe that further negotiation could result in a more favorable outcome. Additionally, the fact that Bob's money loses value at a slower rate than mine means I have an incentive to try and reach a deal that compensates for this discrepancy. By rejecting the offer, I opt to proceed to the next round, hoping to either make a counteroffer that better suits my interests or to pressure Bob into making a more favorable proposal as the rounds progress and the value of the money continues to decrease."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose taking $550,000 and leaving $450,000 for Bob. The message suggests finding a middle ground, which indicates a willingness to compromise and take into account the impact of inflation on both parties. By slightly reducing my initial demand, I aim to make the offer more appealing to Bob while still securing a larger share to compensate for the higher rate of inflation affecting my portion. This approach seeks to balance the need for a timely agreement with the goal of maximizing my gain, considering the game's constraints."
