"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice.  But I think it's important to acknowledge that the money depreciates each round. Let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor to account for that. This allows us both to get a bigger share while the money still holds value. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
