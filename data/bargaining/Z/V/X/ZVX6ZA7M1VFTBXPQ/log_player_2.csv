Alice's offer:

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice.  But I think it's important to acknowledge that the money depreciates each round. Let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor to account for that. This allows us both to get a bigger share while the money still holds value. What do you think?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the depreciation, but 60/40 in your favor is too much. Let's meet in the middle - 55/45. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
