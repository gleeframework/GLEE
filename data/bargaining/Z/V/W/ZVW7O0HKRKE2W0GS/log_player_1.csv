Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see how Bob feels about a 90/10 split.  I think this is a fair offer given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, a 50/50 split is a good deal. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and the inflation will only continue to decrease the value of the money I gain."
