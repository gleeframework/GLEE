"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the total amount I'll get if I accept this offer.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000. However, since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll actually get $400,000 in the same purchasing power as $400,000 in the first round.

Since I'll get less than I initially proposed in the first round, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my offer to make it more favorable for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll offer a slightly larger share to Bob.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 14.26% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual amount he's offering in terms of purchasing power in the first round.

$700,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $601,820

Since this is less than my initial offer in the first round, I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the trend of Bob's offers, it seems like he's trying to take a larger share of the money. To counter this, I'll try to offer a smaller share to Bob. Since my previous offer in round 3 was 420,000, I'll try to reduce it further.

  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering Bob's previous offers, it seems like he's trying to take an increasingly larger share of the money. To counter this, I'll try to offer an even smaller share to Bob. Since my previous offer in round 5 was 380,000, I'll try to reduce it further.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It seems like Bob's offers are getting more and more extreme. I'll try to make a final offer that's as close to my original offer as possible, while still trying to get a better deal.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000

Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round, and Bob's offer is extremely one-sided. Let's calculate the actual amount Bob is offering in terms of purchasing power in the first round.

$990,000 * (1 - 0.4312) = $575,670

Since this is less than my initial offer in the first round, I'll reject this offer.

However, I'll also consider that this is the last round, and if I reject this offer, we'll both get nothing. Given the extremely low amount I'm being offered, I'll decide to accept this offer to at least get some money.
