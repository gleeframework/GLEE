"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since I'll be gaining $4000, which is worth the same as before, and Bob is gaining $6000, which is 5% less than his original offer of $6300, I think this is a good deal for me. I'll accept his offer.
