"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only the first round, and I'm not losing any value on the money. Alice, on the other hand, will lose 20% of the value if we go to the next round. I'm hoping she'll be more generous next time. Let's see what she comes up with!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more this time, since you're losing value and I'm not.""}\n\n###\nI'm taking advantage of the fact that Alice is losing 20% of the value each round, while I'm not. I'm hoping she'll be more willing to accept a less favorable offer this time around. Let's see how she reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting this offer, even though it seems fair on the surface. Since Alice's money is worth 36% less than in the first round, her half of the split is actually worth much less than mine. I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the effects of inflation are working in my favor. Let's see what Alice comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm taking more this time, since your share is worth even less due to inflation.""}\n\n###\nI'm increasing my share again, as Alice's share is now worth even less due to the 36% decrease in value from the first round. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, as the effects of inflation are really starting to hurt her potential gains. Let's see how she reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to stop this inflation from eating away at my share.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting this offer, even though Alice claims it's her final one. With her share being worth 59.04% less than in the first round, her 4500 is actually worth much, much less than my 5500. I'm willing to take the risk of going another round, as I think I can get an even better deal. Let's see if Alice is bluffing about this being her final offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""I'm taking an even bigger share, since your portion is now worth so much less due to inflation. You should accept this before it's worth almost nothing.""}\n\n###\nI'm increasing my share again, as Alice's portion is now worth a whopping 59.04% less than in the first round. I'm hoping she'll finally accept this offer, as the effects of inflation are devastating her potential gains. I'm trying to make her see that it's better to accept this offer rather than risk going another round and losing even more value. Let's see how she reacts!"
