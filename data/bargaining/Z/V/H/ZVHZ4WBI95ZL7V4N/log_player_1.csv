"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer, as it gives Bob a significant portion while allowing me to secure the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 600,000/400,000 split, still in my favor but a more even distribution than my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```
I'm still confident I can get a better deal, especially since Bob seems to be willing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and try to make a more advantageous proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 500,000/500,000 split. It's an even distribution, and with the inflation hitting both of us hard, this is a good way to ensure we both get a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Even though it's slightly less than my preferred split, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and the further we go, the more value we both lose due to inflation."
