"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While a fair split seems like a good idea on the surface, the inflation heavily penalizes me in later rounds. I need to aim for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a fair split, but the inflation puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds. This offer accounts for that and still allows us both to benefit.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I need a slightly better deal to account for the inflation. This offer is still beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, but this offer is still not favorable enough in the long run.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and the value is diminishing with each round. This offer secures a good amount for both of us. Let's be pragmatic and finalize the deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth is pointless. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. Let's not let greed get in the way of a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right.  The longer this goes on, the less valuable the deal becomes, even if I get a larger percentage. A 50/50 split now is better than risking walking away with nothing."
