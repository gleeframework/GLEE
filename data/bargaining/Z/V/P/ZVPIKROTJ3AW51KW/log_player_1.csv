Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my first offer, and it's a bit aggressive.  I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm leaving Bob with something to consider.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this deal or try his luck in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation rate is significantly affecting my potential earnings. It's better to accept this offer and secure a sizable gain, even with the reduced value."
