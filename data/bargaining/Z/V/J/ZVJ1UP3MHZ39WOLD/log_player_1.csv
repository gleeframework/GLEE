```

  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""

```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, but I'll give you a slight edge since you made the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly. With a 5% decrease in value, my gain of $50 is actually worth $47.50 in the first round's terms.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50/50 split, especially since I was hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

Alice's gain in Round 4 is worth 0.85^3 = 0.6149 of the original value, and Bob's gain is worth 0.51^3 = 0.1323 of the original value.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly. With a 14.26% decrease in value, my gain of $45 is actually worth $38.85 in the first round's terms.
