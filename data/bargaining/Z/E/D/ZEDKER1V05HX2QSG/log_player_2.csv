"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a classic ultimatum game. The optimal strategy for Alice is to take most of the money in the first round because Bob has no incentive to reject the offer and risk getting nothing in the next round.  However, I want to see if there's room for negotiation or if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. We can both get a good amount if we split it evenly.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said we could split it evenly, but I think I'm worth more than you right now. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation situation.  I'm going to keep pushing for a fairer split even with the decreasing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're losing money with each round. Let's compromise. This is a fair offer considering the inflation.""}
