Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was too low for me.  I'm proposing a more even split this time.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000
