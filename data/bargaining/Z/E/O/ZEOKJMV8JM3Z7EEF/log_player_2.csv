"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we start with a reasonable offer. This gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation, but ensures you get a good chunk right away. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was too low for me.  I'm proposing a more even split this time.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing with every round. This offer still gives you a significant amount, and ensures we both benefit before inflation takes its toll. It's a win-win. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
