"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, giving both of us $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I should give up 20$ to Bob, even if it's a majority share. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight majority, but I'm not giving up much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a majority, in an attempt to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to get a bit greedy...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. 70$ is a good deal, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting less."
