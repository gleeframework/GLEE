Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share to ensure he doesn't reject my offer immediately. I want to get most of the money while ensuring the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 980000, ""bob_gain"": 20000}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share slightly to try and make my offer more appealing.  I'm still aiming to get the majority of the money, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of the money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something. It's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing everything."
