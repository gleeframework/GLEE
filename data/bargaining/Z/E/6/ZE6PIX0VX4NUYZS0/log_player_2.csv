"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the lion's share, but you'll get something to begin with. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me only 100,000.  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to compensate for the inflation.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and the inflation is starting to bite.  This offer gives me a decent chunk and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
