Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to avoid any potential losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation makes this unfavorable to me. I need to incentivize Bob to take a deal sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle a bit. This offer still gives you a sizable share, and we both benefit from settling sooner.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob is getting desperate, but this offer is heavily skewed in his favor.  I need to hold firm and emphasize the shrinking pot."
