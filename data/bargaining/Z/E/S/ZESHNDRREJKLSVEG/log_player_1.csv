"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept.  This way, we both get something and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, even with the inflation on his side.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by pushing for another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to propose a compromise this round. While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I'm willing to give Bob a bit more than his previous offer.  This way, we can hopefully reach an agreement before inflation eats away at our earnings even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and the inflation effect is starting to be significant for him. I'm not going to accept this offer. I'm still hoping for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm sticking with my initial strategy of offering a generous deal, but with a slight decrease to account for the inflation Bob has been experiencing.  This should be a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will accept."
