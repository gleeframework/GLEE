I'm starting with a high offer for myself, but leaving a little bit for Bob.  It's a good first step to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
