Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time to be fair. I'm offering you a small share, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""I'm still confident in my ability to get a better deal.  Let's keep negotiating.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're being stubborn. This is my final offer before we both lose money due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is the best I can reasonably expect given the inflation and the limited rounds.  It's better to take what's offered than risk getting nothing."
