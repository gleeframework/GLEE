"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nHow's that? I offered Bob $40, which is a relatively fair share, but I took a bit more for myself since I'm the one making the first offer. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split. I think 60/40 is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer of $40 for me and $60 for him. Since we're still in the early rounds, I want to negotiate for a better deal. In the next round, I'll try to propose a more favorable split for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nI've decided to propose a split of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. By meeting in the middle, I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable solution. The message is a friendly suggestion to find common ground."
