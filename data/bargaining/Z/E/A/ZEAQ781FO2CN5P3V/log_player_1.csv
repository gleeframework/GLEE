"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a very small amount.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I want to maximize my potential gains in the first round.  If he rejects, I'll have to be more generous later, but I hope he'll be tempted by even a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than my previous offer, and I don't want to risk him rejecting again and potentially getting a worse offer in the next round.  50/50 is a good split, and I'm happy to take it."
