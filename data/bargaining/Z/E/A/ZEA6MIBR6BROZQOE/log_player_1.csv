"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a 50/50 split, let's see if we can find a better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. A 50/50 split is a good starting point, but I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 80% of its original value. I'll aim to get a larger share this round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm hoping to make up for it in future rounds.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to make up for the lost value with this offer, hoping to get closer to a fair split 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain each round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, considering the current value of the money, $10,000 is now worth about 64% of its original value, so the offer from Bob is actually a good one.
