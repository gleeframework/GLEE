{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a good share of the money.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 666667 
# Bob gain: 333333 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. It's not a good deal for me, even with the inflation factor.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try and get a larger share this time, but still leave Bob with something. I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept a reasonable offer now that he knows I'm not afraid to reject his proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer.  I'm willing to take a smaller share, but not that much smaller.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer this time, but I still want to hold onto the majority of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give him everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I'm willing to compromise, but Bob's offer is still too high. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a significant share. I'm hoping Bob is starting to realize that he needs to compromise to get any money at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is not ideal, the inflation is really starting to bite. It's better to take what I can get at this point, rather than risk getting nothing. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
