"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the decreased value of the money, while still trying to get a slightly better deal."
