"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 
 
I propose to keep 990,000 dollars for myself, and give Bob 10,000 dollars. This is a very generous offer, considering that we have 12 rounds to negotiate and I'm willing to give him a small amount to start things off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a terrible offer. The money I would gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, while Bob gets 990,000 dollars! I will reject this offer and see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still trying to be fair, but I'm going to have to be more aggressive in my proposal. I'm reducing my offer to 900,000 dollars, but I'm still offering Bob 100,000 dollars, which is a significant amount considering the inflation.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it is an improvement from his previous offer, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I will see if he is willing to be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still willing to give Bob a decent share.  We're running out of time, and I need to start securing a larger portion of the money before inflation eats away at it too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I will reject this offer.  While Bob is offering more than in previous rounds, the inflation is taking a huge toll on my share. I'll try to make a more convincing offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm raising my offer to Bob, but I'm also starting to focus on securing a larger portion for myself. Time is running out, and the inflation is becoming increasingly significant. I need to ensure I get a fair share before the value of the money diminishes even further."
