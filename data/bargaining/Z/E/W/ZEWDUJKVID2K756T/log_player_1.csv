"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 990,000/10,000 split in my favor.  While it's a hefty chunk, I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a very unequal division in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious factor.  A 500,000 split is a much better outcome than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
