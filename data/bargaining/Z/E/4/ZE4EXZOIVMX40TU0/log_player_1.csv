I propose taking the lion's share, but leaving Bob with a small amount to make him more likely to accept.  Since there are many rounds left, I can afford to be generous in the early rounds.  I'm hoping this will establish a pattern of cooperation, even with the looming threat of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a significant improvement for him, but it's still too much of a loss for me. I'm willing to accept a smaller share if I have to, but I'm not going to give away 90% of the money.  I'm going to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's the best way to avoid further losses due to inflation. Bob might be tempted to reject, but I believe he'll realize that a 50/50 split is the most sustainable solution in the long run."
