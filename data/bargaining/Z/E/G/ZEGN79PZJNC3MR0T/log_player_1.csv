"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my expectations. Since Bob's offer is still higher than my initial offer, I'll consider it. However, I can do better than 49. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is taking its toll! With the money worth 5% less for me again, I'll aim to get a bit more. Here's my new proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly higher share, but still leave room for Bob to negotiate."
