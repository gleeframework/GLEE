"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you everything 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
