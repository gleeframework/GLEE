"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, a fair start to our negotiation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, a straightforward and fair starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, I'm starting strong! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I need to consider the relative values.

In this round, my gain of $4000 is still worth $4000, but Bob's gain of $6000 is worth $4800 (20% less).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more strategic offer this time. Considering the inflation and Bob's aggressive starting offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but with a slight edge for me""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to take a slightly larger share while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to give up that much! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to consider the relative values.

In this round, my gain of $4500 is still worth $4500, but Bob's gain of $5500 is worth $2850 (48.8% less).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. However, I'm getting closer to my target, so I'll consider accepting this offer.
