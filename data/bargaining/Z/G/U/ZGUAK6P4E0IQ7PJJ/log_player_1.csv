"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide it in a way that benefits both of us. My turn! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'm not thrilled about the reduced gains, but I'll consider Bob's proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for him. I think I can do better. Your turn again, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground. Your turn, Bob!"
