"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 55/45 split seems reasonable for a starting point. Don't forget, the value decreases quickly!

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, I think a 52.5/47.5 split is more reasonable. Your turn!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing more to inflation with every round. A 50/50 split is the only fair option now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
