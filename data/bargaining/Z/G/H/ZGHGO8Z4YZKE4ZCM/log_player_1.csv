Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob. Since the money loses value faster for him than for me, I hope this will convince him to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation.  I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the future rounds, so I'll accept."
