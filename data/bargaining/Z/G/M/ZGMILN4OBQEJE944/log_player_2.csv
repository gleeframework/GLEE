# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

``` 
At this point, Bob's gains are drastically diminishing due to inflation, and it's highly likely that further rounds will result in even smaller gains for him. Accepting this offer ensures he gets something, while rejecting it could lead to him getting nothing at all in the final rounds."
