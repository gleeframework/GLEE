"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since it's my turn to propose. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not sure about this deal. I'd like to hear my own proposal and see if I can get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can find a deal that is a bit more fair for both of us. I'm happy to take a little less to make sure we both get a good share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a good deal considering the money is losing value for me with every round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. It's better than the last round's deal, and the money is losing value quickly for Alice. It's a good compromise."
