**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me (Alice).  Waiting any longer will only result in even less favorable offers.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has shifted his position slightly, offering me the amount I wanted in the previous round. While I lose out due to inflation, it's better than risking even lower offers in future rounds. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount, whereas rejecting means gambling on Bob's future offers and the continuous impact of inflation."
