"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. A little more than half for me since I'm taking on the inflation risk.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand you bear the brunt of the inflation, but let's be realistic.  My turn to propose.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a significant share. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to avoid further losses from inflation. This is a fair and simple solution. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
