"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is technically a gain for me, it's incredibly uneven. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want a much larger share.  Let's see what she's willing to do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's work together to make this a win-win situation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 65/35 split is more in line with my expectations. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to a more equitable split, I still believe a 60/40 split is the most fair, especially considering the potential for further inflation.  I'll continue negotiating in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but a 55/45 split seems like a good middle ground. Let's avoid losing more money to inflation!""}
