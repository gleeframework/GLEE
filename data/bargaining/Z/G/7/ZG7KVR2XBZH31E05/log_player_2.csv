"Round 1

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  This offer is still good for both of us, but we need to act fast. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be reasonable, but the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This is a fair compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but the longer we wait, the less appealing this becomes for you.  Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While my potential gains are decreasing, accepting an offer where I get significantly less than half is not in my best interest. I need to push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to make a deal, but it has to be reasonable. This offer accounts for the shrinking value of the money over time. Let's be done with this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out the longer this drags on.  Take this offer and let's move on! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to reject Alice's offers.  If I reject this, I risk walking away with nothing."
