Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 60:40 split, where I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. This maintains fairness while accounting for the decrease in value of money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Alice made the same offer I made in round 2, but with the adjusted values due to inflation. I'll reject this offer as well.
