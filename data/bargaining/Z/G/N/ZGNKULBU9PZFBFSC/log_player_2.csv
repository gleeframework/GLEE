Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, I'm losing value fast, compromise a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation, but her offer is still not favorable. While she loses value quickly, I don't need to concede to an unfair deal.  I'll hold out for a bit longer and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Time is running out! A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option.  Let's end this before we both lose out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push for a truly fair split.  Alice has consistently rejected offers tilted in her favor, but the pressure of inflation is mounting for her. Offering a 50/50 split now is a strong stance showing I'm willing to be fair but won't be exploited. It emphasizes the urgency of the situation for both of us."
