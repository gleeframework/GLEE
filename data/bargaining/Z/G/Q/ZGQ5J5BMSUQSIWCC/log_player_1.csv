}"

Round 2

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my share is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I'll have to decide whether to take a smaller share now or risk waiting for a better offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000

Round 4

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of our potential earnings. I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the money worth less than half of what it was in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate.

I'll accept this offer.
