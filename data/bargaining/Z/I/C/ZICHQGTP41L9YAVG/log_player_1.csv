"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a clear sign that he's taking advantage of the inflation.  I'm not going to accept that just yet.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm lowering my offer a bit, but I'm still aiming for a decent share.  Inflation is working against me, but I need to stay competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still holding out hope that I can negotiate something better. Inflation is making things difficult, but I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5760, ""bob_gain"": 4240}

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a reasonable share.  I need to find a balance between securing a good deal and preventing Bob from getting too greedy."
