"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is already biting! I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I'm ready to accept this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further. The 30-70 split is a bit too lopsided, and I'd like to aim for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split this time, and I think 55-45 is a fair compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer. I was hoping to get a better deal, and I still think I can negotiate a better split. The 45-55 split is closer, but I'd like to try to push for an even split or something closer to 50-50."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, 50-50 it is!""
}
```

I'm going for an even split this time, 50-50. I think this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it."
