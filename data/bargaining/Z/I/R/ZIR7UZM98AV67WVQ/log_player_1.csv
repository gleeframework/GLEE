"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, with me getting 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. We can still negotiate from here! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly. Since Bob's offer is 6000 for me, I'll calculate its value in terms of the original $10,000.

6000 is 60% of the original $10,000, which is worth 95% of the value of 6000 in Round 1.

So, I'll consider the effective gain as 57% of the original $10,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll hold out for a better deal!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly.

Since the money is worth 95% of the value of Round 2, I'll aim for a gain that's around 57% of the original $10,000, which is slightly less than what I got in Round 2.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 ratio, with me getting 55% of the original $10,000 and Bob getting 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly.

Since Bob's offer is 5000 for me, I'll calculate its value in terms of the original $10,000.

5000 is 50% of the original $10,000, which is worth 85.74% of the value of 5000 in Round 1.

So, I'll consider the effective gain as 42.87% of the original $10,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's make a deal! 50/50 is a fair split!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer and ending the game."
