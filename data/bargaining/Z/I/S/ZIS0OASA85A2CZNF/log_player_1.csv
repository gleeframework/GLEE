"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $95 for myself and give $5 to Bob. This is a fair starting point, as the money will be worth less for Bob in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. Even though Bob is losing money due to inflation, his offer is still significantly less advantageous to me than my initial proposal.  I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $10, which is $5 less than my initial offer. This accounts for the inflation that has affected him, while still giving me a large share of the money. I believe this is a fair compromise that will likely be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While the inflation affecting Bob is becoming more significant, his offer is still too low. I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I am offering Bob $15, which is $5 less than my previous offer. This is a fair compromise that accounts for the significant inflation that has affected Bob. I believe he is more likely to accept this offer, as it is a better deal for him than the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is not ideal, it is the best I can expect given the significant inflation he has experienced.  Accepting this offer means I get half the money, which is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
