"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly suggestion to be reasonable and accept this offer, considering it's a relatively fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. How about a slightly more even split? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, especially considering the relatively small difference in the proposed split. With the inflation, the money is worth less now, but I'm hoping to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round. Let's proceed and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $475,000 and keeping $525,000 for myself. Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is now $950,000 (1,000,000 * 0.95 * 0.95), but I'm making the offer based on the original amount to keep the negotiation simple. My message suggests meeting in the middle, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. Let's see how Bob responds!"
