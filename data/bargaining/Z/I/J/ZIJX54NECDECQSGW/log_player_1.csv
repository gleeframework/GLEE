"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the lower amount this round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we split it fairly and I'm willing to take the smaller share this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority this round, but I'll give you a decent chunk too 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $2,000
* Bob gain: $8,000

I'm not thrilled about giving up a significant portion of the money, but Bob's offer is still a decent chunk for me. I'll accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
