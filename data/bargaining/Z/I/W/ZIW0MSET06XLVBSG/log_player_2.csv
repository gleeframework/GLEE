Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not afraid of inflation, I'll take the risk 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit my higher inflation rate.  While the deal is getting worse due to inflation, accepting such a low amount now sets a bad precedent for future rounds. It's likely she'll continue lowballing me, hoping I'll panic as we get closer to the final round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option.  We both lose if this drags on.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value decreases significantly. A 50/50 split now is better than a slightly better deal later that's been heavily impacted by inflation.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair and removes any argument about who is being greedy. This can help nudge Alice towards a quick agreement.
* **Shifting Dynamics:** By proposing a fair deal, I'm putting the pressure on Alice. If she rejects this, it becomes clearer that she's the one unwilling to compromise, potentially making her more willing to accept a similar deal in the next round."
