Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

I'm offering to take $550,000 and giving Bob $450,000, with a message suggesting a relatively fair split to start the negotiations. Waiting for Bob's response!"

# Bob's message: I believe in fairness too. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,

}


I'm increasing my share to $600,000, given that Bob's money is worth less with each passing round. Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Time is on my side""

I'm increasing my share again, given that Bob's money is worth even less now. The pressure is on Bob to accept a less favorable deal."

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance before I take it all""
}


I'm making a bold move, increasing my share again. With the inflation, Bob's share is worth significantly less, and I'm betting he'll rather take something than risk getting nothing."
