Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting worse, I need to consider that accepting means I get *something*. If I continue to reject, there's a chance Alice will offer me nothing in the final round, and the deal will be significantly worse due to inflation. It's time to start demonstrating that my acceptance threshold is approaching."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm feeling the inflation pinch.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance before I take it all 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the risk of getting nothing in the final round is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, even though it's significantly less than what I could have gotten earlier. Alice is clearly playing hardball and leveraging the inflation against me."
