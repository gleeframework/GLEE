Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not happy with an unfair split. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor this round.  It's more fair and we can avoid the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
