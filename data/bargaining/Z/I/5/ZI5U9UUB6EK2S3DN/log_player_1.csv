"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a relatively generous starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 2, the money was worth 90% of its initial value, so now it's worth 90% of 90% = 81% of its initial value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than its initial value, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

Alice's gain: 450,000 / (1 - 0.271) = 450,000 / 0.729 = 617,924

Bob's gain: 550,000 / (1 - 0.271) = 550,000 / 0.729 = 753,176

My gain is worth less than Bob's gain, and it's a relatively small difference. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer.
