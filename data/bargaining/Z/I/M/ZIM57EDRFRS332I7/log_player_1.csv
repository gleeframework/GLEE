Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is generous!  I'm starting with a very slight advantage for myself, but I'm open to negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and it's better to secure half the money now than risk getting nothing later due to inflation."
