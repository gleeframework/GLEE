"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This might seem like a reasonable split given the stakes and the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the risk of inflation.  Let's make a deal and avoid losing money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
