"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand you want to be fair, but the value of the money decreases rapidly for you.  This is a better offer for both of us in the long run.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, her offer is still not advantageous to me in the long run. The longer this goes on, the more valuable my share becomes due to the difference in inflation rates. I need to push for a better split, even if it means risking a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. This offer is the most favorable split you'll get, considering how quickly the value decreases for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is finally moving closer to a more realistic split, but it's still not in my best interest.  While a 45/55 split might seem fair at first glance, the rapidly decreasing value for Alice makes this offer much better for me than it seems. I need to hold out for a larger share, knowing that each round makes my position stronger."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out! This offer is more than generous considering the inflation. You need to accept now before the value decreases even further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a hit from inflation, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is cutting it close, but I need to accept. While not ideal, Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation and offering a near 50/50 split. With each passing round, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly. Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable share, even though it's less than what I could have gotten in earlier rounds."
