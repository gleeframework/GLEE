Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split it 65/35 in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hitting her much harder than me.  It's worth risking another round to see if I can secure a more equitable split."
