This is a terrible deal for Bob!  Even with the inflation, 50,000 is way too low. Bob should try to get a much better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is still not an ideal deal, it's significantly better than Bob's previous offer and considering the inflation, it's a reasonable outcome. Bob is getting 200,000, which is still a decent amount, and the inflation makes Alice's offer more attractive."
