I'll keep a good chunk of the money for myself, but still offer Bob a decent amount in the hopes of ending the game quickly. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is pretty bad for me. Even with inflation, I'm still losing a lot of money compared to the first round. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money, but since I'm losing money due to inflation, I'll try to be slightly more reasonable with my offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal compared to the last round and accept."
