"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the first to propose and have less inflation working against me. Let's see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the inflation rates and the fact that Bob is now the one making the offer. Accepting ensures a guaranteed outcome, whereas rejecting could lead to a worse outcome in future rounds."
