"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a fairly even split, with a slight bias towards myself to account for the fact that the money doesn't lose value for me. The message is a simple ""Let's split fairly"" to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the split is more even, I was initially offered more in the first round, and considering the money doesn't lose value for me, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make an offer that still favors me but takes into account that we've already had two rounds of negotiation. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'll offer him a bit less than before but still aim for a relatively even split that leans in my favor.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\n###\n\nThe message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust"" is to acknowledge the impact of inflation on Bob's gains and to suggest a compromise that considers this factor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
