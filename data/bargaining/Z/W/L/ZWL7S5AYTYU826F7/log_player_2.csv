Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. Inflation is hitting us both, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about a 60/40 split? I'll take 60% since I'm making the offer, and you get 40%. It's better than us both getting nothing.  
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
