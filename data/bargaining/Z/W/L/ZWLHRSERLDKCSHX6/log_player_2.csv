Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 52:48 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a reasonable advantage while acknowledging the diminishing value of money for Bob. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
