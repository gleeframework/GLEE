"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at my potential gain. Given the new numbers, I think I should accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
