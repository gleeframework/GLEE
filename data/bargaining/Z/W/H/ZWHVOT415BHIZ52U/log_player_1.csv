Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

# Bob gain: 600000

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still significantly less than my initial proposal, even with the inflation. While it's a larger sum for me than the previous round,  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction. I'll continue to negotiate."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I've been rejecting Bob's offers so far, but with the inflation getting worse, I'm willing to accept this offer. It's still significantly less than my initial proposal, but it's the best I can get at this point.  It's crucial to secure some of the money before it's worth even less."
