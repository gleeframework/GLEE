"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would get $500,000 and Bob would get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you halfway, but I want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the value of the money Bob gains. With the 5% decrease in value, Bob's gain of $700,000 is equivalent to $665,000 in the first round.

Considering the message ""You started high, I'll meet you halfway, but I want a bit more!"", I'm guessing Bob is trying to get a better deal. I'll respond accordingly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not as much as you wanted. Let's meet in the middle again!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, where I would get $450,000 and Bob would get $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more. This is my final offer for now! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Let's analyze the numbers. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the value of the money Bob gains. With the 14.26% decrease in value, Bob's gain of $600,000 is equivalent to $516,400 in the first round.

Considering Bob's message, I sense that he's trying to make a final offer, and I should think carefully about it. However, I'm not convinced that this is the best deal for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was still a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's even more favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a bit more. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again!""}

I'm proposing a 47.5/52.5 split, where I would get $475,000 and Bob would get $525,000."
