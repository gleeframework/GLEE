"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you take 20%.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 30% and you take 70%. It's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the numbers are:

* My gain: 700000 (down 20% from 800000)
* Bob's gain: 300000 (down 5% from 315000, which is 20% of 1,575,000, the value of 1,000,000 after inflation)

I'll consider Bob's offer. I'd rather have a higher share, but I don't want to risk going to another round. I'll accept this offer.
