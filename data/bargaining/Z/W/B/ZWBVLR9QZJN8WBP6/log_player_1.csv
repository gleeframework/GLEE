"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose to take 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation will affect me more than him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 89 
# Bob gain: 11 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
