Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, don't be stubborn, 57-43 is the most reasonable split we'll get 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value is decreasing significantly with each round.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a better split, even if it means risking getting closer to the deadline.  The longer this goes on, the more pressure is on Alice to make a real concession."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5700,
""alice_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to turn up the heat.  I'm mirroring Alice's offer to show her how unreasonable she's being.  By calling it my ""final offer"" I'm increasing the pressure, hoping she'll crack and accept a 50/50 split next round before we both lose out."
