"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

This way, I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer from round 1 is no longer on the table, and I have to consider Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'll have to think carefully about the offer. However, I'll still consider it a relatively good deal.

I accept Bob's offer:
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
