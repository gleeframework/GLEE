"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority but it's still a good deal for you!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it a little closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I don't want to wait for another round and risk losing more value due to inflation.
