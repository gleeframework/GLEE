Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good deal, but I'll get the majority. Consider it!""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
