"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the money now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a fair deal, and I think Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option, considering the initial offer I made was already quite generous. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round with a smaller amount of money.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
