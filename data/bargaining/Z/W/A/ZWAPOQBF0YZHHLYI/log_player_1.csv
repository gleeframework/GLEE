"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was a bit too aggressive with my initial offer.

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet Bob halfway just yet. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing by 10% again, I'll try to make a more reasonable offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself to make this worthwhile.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take Bob's offer, as it seems like a fair split considering the current value of the money. I'll get $4,500, and Bob will get $5,500."
