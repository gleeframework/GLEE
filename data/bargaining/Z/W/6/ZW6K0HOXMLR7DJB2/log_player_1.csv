"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, with me getting 80% of the $100 and Bob getting 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further negotiations!"
