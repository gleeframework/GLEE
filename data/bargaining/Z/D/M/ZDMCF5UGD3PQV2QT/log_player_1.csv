Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about fairness, but I think we should aim for a more balanced outcome given the inflation factor. How about a 51/49 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
