600000.0,400000.0,Let's be fair and split it 60-40. It's better for both of us to get something than to risk getting nothing due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
502500.0,497500.0,"I understand you want a larger share, so I'm proposing a 49.75/50.25 split in your favor. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses from inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not satisfied with the split. Considering the inflation, I'm making a counteroffer of 55-45. It's still a fair deal, and we should settle before the money loses more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
505000.0,495000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic.  Inflation is hurting me more than you. I'm offering a 49.5/50.5 split. It's a good deal considering the circumstances, and we're running out of time.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"I understand inflation is affecting you more, but I'm not willing to give up my advantage. I'm making a new offer of 58-42. Each round you wait, the money loses more value for you. It's time to make a decision.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
519750.0,480250.0,"Alice, I'm trying to be fair, but this is my bottom line. 48/52 split.  We need to settle this now before inflation eats away at any potential gains for both of us.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
620000.0,380000.0,"You said that was your bottom line, but I'm not buying it. Inflation is killing your share, and I'm not going to give in now. I'm making a 62-38 offer. Take it or watch your share dwindle further.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to compromise significantly to end this standoff. Let's split it 55/45, the same offer you proposed earlier. It's clear we won't agree on anything else, and this way we both avoid further losses from inflation.",Bob,8,
