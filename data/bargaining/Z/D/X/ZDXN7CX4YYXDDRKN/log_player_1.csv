"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point, in my opinion. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not risk going to the next round, so I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
