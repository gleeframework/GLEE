Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I take 999,999 dollars and Bob receives 1 dollar. This is a fair offer, considering the 12 rounds and potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
