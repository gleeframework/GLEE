"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and minimize the impact of inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, and we are only in the second round.  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share so early in the game. I will counter with a more equitable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share than in my initial offer, but still keeping a significant portion for myself. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair one, considering Bob rejected my first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more unfavorable for me. I'm still not willing to accept a deal where I get less than 50% of the money, even though we are only in the 4th round. I will counter with a fairer proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option considering the inflation we're facing.  I'm hoping Bob will finally see reason and accept this offer."
