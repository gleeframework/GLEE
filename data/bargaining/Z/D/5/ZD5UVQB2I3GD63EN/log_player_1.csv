"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more for being the better negotiator. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's claim of being a better negotiator, and I'm not willing to give up 40% of the total amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 42% is fair considering the initial split was 50/50. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a larger share considering the inflation and my negotiation skills. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed by Bob's claim of being a better negotiator, and I don't think I'm getting a fair deal. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'd like to try to get a better share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make a new offer in the next round, trying to take into account the decreasing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the increasing gap between the initial and current values of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think 36% is the maximum I'm willing to offer. Let's see if you'll accept a slightly larger share for yourself.""
}
