"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This is a fairly aggressive offer, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept, as he'll get something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money,  the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Taking 70% is better than risking getting even less in the next round, especially considering Bob is becoming more assertive with his proposals."
