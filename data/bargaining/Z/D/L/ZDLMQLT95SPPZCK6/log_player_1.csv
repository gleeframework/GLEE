I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, but I want to secure the majority of the money since the value is decreasing with each round.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a decent compromise. Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is offering a larger share than he received in the previous round, this seems like a good opportunity to avoid further risk and secure a significant portion of the money."
