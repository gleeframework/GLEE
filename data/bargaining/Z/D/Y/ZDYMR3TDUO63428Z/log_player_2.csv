"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a fair start.  Let's see what you think! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very generous offer from Alice, but the inflation is heavily in my favor. I should be able to negotiate a much better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. Time is money, and it's losing value fast for you."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that time is money, but we both lose more with each passing round.  Let's be a little more reasonable this time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but this offer is still not favorable enough. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. It's time to make a deal that benefits us both before it's too late."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money.  Let's split it evenly and get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. While this isn't the best deal I could have gotten in the early rounds, continuing to hold out is getting too risky. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
