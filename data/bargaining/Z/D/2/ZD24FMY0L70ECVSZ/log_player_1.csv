Let's start fair! I propose we split the money equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```

I'm going to try to get a bit more this time, since Bob is losing value on his share more quickly. I think this offer is fair considering the inflation rates."
