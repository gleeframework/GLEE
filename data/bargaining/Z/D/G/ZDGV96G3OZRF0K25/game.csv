75.0,25.0,"Let's split the money with a 3:1 ratio. I'll take 75$, you take 25$. It's fair considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I'll take 60, you take 40. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation rate.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"I'll take 40, you take 60. It's a more balanced split considering the increasing gap due to inflation, and it's still better than the 20% I would get if we continue to the next round.",Bob,4,
