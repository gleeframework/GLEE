"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This is a fair split, with me getting 60% and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $6000 * 0.9 = $5400
* Bob's gain: $4000 * 0.95 = $3800

Bob's offer is 5000 for me and 5000 for him, which is a 50-50 split. I'll accept this offer.
