I propose a division of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rate.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this is a tempting offer, I need to be strategic.  Even though the value of the money is decreasing, I'm still early in the game and can likely get a better deal later.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can secure a larger share."

```

I'm offering $850,000 for myself and $150,000 for Bob. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still trying to maximize my share while leaving room for negotiation. We're getting closer to the end, so I'm not willing to give up too much."

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. Even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly, I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. The inflation rate is hurting us both, but I believe I can still improve my position."
