"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose taking $9000 and giving $1000 to Bob. This ensures I get the majority, but also allows for a potential for a deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money.  The inflation is a significant factor, and the potential for losing everything is a risk I'm not willing to take."
