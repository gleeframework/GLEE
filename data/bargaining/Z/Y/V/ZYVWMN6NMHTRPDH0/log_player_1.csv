"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I also want to ensure I get a fair share. How about this: I'll take 55$, and you get 45$. Let's be reasonable and find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
