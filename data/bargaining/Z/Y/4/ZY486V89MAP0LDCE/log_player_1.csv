"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. 50/50 is the most logical way to split this money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not sure I'm ready to give up that much. I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm looking for something better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, hoping to get a better deal this time around."
