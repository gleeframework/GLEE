{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose you take 900,000 and Bob takes 100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we have many rounds to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose a 800,000/200,000 split. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I've lowered my share by 100,000, but I'm still willing to give him a good portion."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's higher than his previous offer, my share is still significantly less than what I believe I deserve.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but we need to find a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 700,000/300,000 split this time.  I've lowered my share again, but I'm still trying to be fair.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is completely unacceptable. My share is drastically lower than what I deserve, and even though I'm willing to compromise, this is just unfair. We need to find a more balanced solution.  I'm still open to negotiating, but this offer is a step too far."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 600,000/400,000 split.  Time is running out, and I'm trying to be reasonable.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering the inflation and the fact that we're getting closer to the end of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair.  I'm unwilling to accept such a small share, especially considering the inflation and the fact that we are nearing the end of the game.  I'm still open to negotiating, but we need to find a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. We are running out of time, and this is the most equitable solution I can offer given the circumstances. It's a fair split considering the inflation we've both experienced."
