Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 548750 
# Bob gain: 451250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate as the value of his potential gain decreases. While his offer is closer to a ""fair"" split in his eyes, I'm still in a strong position. He's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am.  I'll hold out for a better offer in the next round."

Round 5

{

""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it.  Take this offer, or we both risk losing out.  The clock is ticking, and your potential gain is shrinking fast.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm applying pressure and offering a slightly better deal for Bob than his last offer. This makes it clear I'm negotiating but still holding onto a significant share.  It's a final push to get Bob to agree before his potential gain diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking to my guns. This is a fair split considering the inflation, and I'm not willing to lose more value. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 571250 
# Bob gain: 428750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but I need to be realistic. While Bob's offer is still  in his favor, it's getting close to a point where I'm risking too much for a marginally better outcome. The longer this goes on, the more pressure there is on both of us.  Accepting now guarantees a good share for me and avoids the risk of Bob getting desperate and offering even less in a later round."
