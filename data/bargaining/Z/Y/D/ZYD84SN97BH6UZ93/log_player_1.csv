"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain of 600,000 in the first round is now worth 480,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer, since I'd rather not give up 120,000 of my potential gain.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, my target gain should be higher to account for the inflation.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my target gain should be even higher to account for the increased inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer, as it's not enough to compensate for the reduced value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 61.36% less than in the first round, my target gain should be significantly higher to account for the increased inflation.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, my target gain should be even higher to account for the increased inflation.

However, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a significant concession from his previous offers. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
