This offer gives me a larger share of the money, but it's important to keep Bob happy enough to potentially accept. We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite. It's likely that further rounds will result in even smaller gains for me, and this offer is at least a fair split. Accepting now ensures I get something, which is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
