"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and straightforward way to divide the $10,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll propose a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer than before, but still trying to maintain a reasonable balance between our shares. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try to find a compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now! I'll have to be careful with my next move.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable than before, but I'm still not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
