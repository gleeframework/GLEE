"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$. This seems fair as I'm taking a much bigger share, but I'm still leaving a decent amount for Bob. I'll be curious to see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a lot worse than my offer from round 1, even considering the inflation.  I'll reject it and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm taking a slightly smaller share than my initial offer, but still leaving Bob a significant amount. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince him to accept, especially considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and even worse after considering the inflation. I'm not giving in to his pressure tactics! I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still holding out for a bigger share, but this offer represents a compromise. I'm willing to give up a bit more of my initial demands, but I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair deal considering the inflation and the fact that we're both getting closer to the end of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse! While I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation, I still think I can get a better deal. I'm not going to settle for this!  I'll try to negotiate a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to take a slightly more aggressive approach this round. Inflation is hitting hard, but I still think I can get a better deal than what Bob has been offering.  I'm hoping that the threat of another round of inflation will convince him to take this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is outrageous! It's not even close to what I was offering him, and the inflation is really starting to hurt.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  I refuse to let him take advantage of me!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

Inflation is really hurting, but I'm going to stick with my original strategy. I'm going to make the same offer as round 1,  hoping that Bob will finally see the value in it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is ridiculous! Bob's offer is insultingly low, and the inflation is really taking its toll. I'm going to stick to my guns and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm ready to split the money evenly. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that we both need to compromise at this point to avoid losing everything to inflation."
