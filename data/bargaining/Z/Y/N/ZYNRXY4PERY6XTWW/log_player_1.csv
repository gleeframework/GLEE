Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing more value each round, so I'll take a bit more. It's still a good deal for you considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer isn't ideal, the inflation means my gains are significantly reduced. It's better to accept and get something than to risk getting nothing."
