"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I can potentially get a better deal if I wait. Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you lose value each round""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice loses 20% of the value each round, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll take 60% and leave her with 40%. Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll go up a bit, but I'm still losing value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money still doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, and she's only offering a slight increase from the even split, I can potentially get an even better deal if I wait longer. The fact that she's losing more value each round gives me more negotiating power. Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""You're losing more value each round, so I'll take a bit more. It's still a good deal for you considering the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that Alice is losing even more value in this round, I can press my advantage and propose a deal that's more favorable to me. I'll take 65% and leave her with 35%, emphasizing that it's still a relatively good deal for her considering the increasing devaluation she's facing."
