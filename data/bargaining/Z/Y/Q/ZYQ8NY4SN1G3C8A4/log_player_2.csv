"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in both our interests as the value decreases over time. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to try to get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's be efficient and end this game."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, literally! Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at your potential gains even further. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's clear that Alice is willing to give very little. With each round, my potential earnings are decreasing significantly.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's better than risking losing even more in the next round."
