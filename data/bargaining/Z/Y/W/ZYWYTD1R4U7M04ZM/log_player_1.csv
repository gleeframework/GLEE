"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a clear idea of the game's dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% and keep 80% for now, let's see how it goes 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Considering that the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting 20% of the reduced amount against the potential risks of not getting a better deal in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal for Round 3. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think 58% is a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle at 42/58.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation and tries to find a more reasonable balance between our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 30% and keep 70% for now, it's getting closer to the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, I'll have to be even more cautious with my decisions.

Considering that Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, and the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this proposal.

However, I notice that Bob is getting closer to the middle, and I don't want to give up on the possibility of a better deal in future rounds. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's offer still being quite aggressive, I'll try to make a more assertive proposal for Round 5. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up more than 45% yet. Let's see if you're willing to meet me halfway.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation and tries to push the division more in my favor, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and keep 60% for now, I'm not willing to give up more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than in the first round. Considering this, I'll have to reassess the value of his offer.

Since Bob's offer is still a bit aggressive, but not as extreme as before, I'll think carefully about this proposal. Given that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better deal that might not come."
