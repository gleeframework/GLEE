"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer. With the inflation rates, I'm losing 10% each round, but Alice is losing 20%. This might give me some leverage to negotiate for a larger share. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make an offer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation rates. I'll also try to make the message friendly and encouraging to see if Alice will accept.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. We both get a good amount, and we can end this game early to minimize losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more, so I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Alice is trying to make it sound like a final offer, but we're only in round 3. I think she's trying to create a sense of urgency. Considering the inflation rates, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Alice is losing more value each round, so I'll try to use this to my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","With the inflation rates in mind, I'll make an offer that still favors me slightly, but also acknowledges Alice's concerns about losing value. I'll try to make the message clear and concise, emphasizing the benefits of accepting this offer.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation affects you more, but we both lose if we don't agree soon. This offer balances our needs, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is a compromise, acknowledging the shrinking pot. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the values are decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. We're only halfway through the game, and Alice is losing value faster than I am. Her message tries to create a sense of urgency, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to make a more appealing offer in the next round, considering the decreasing values."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the significant decrease in value for both of us. Since Alice is losing value faster, I'll try to find a balance that acknowledges this while still favoring me slightly. My message will emphasize the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""We're both losing a lot of value. A 50/50 split at this point is the fairest option, considering the inflation. Let's end this game before we both lose even more.""}"
