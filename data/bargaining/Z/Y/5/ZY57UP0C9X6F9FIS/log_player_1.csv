Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing a lot of value. A 50/50 split at this point is the fairest option, considering the inflation. Let's end this game before we both lose even more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the inflation is severely eating into the potential gains. While not ideal, a 50/50 split ensures I at least get something, whereas continuing risks getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
