"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get $50, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to account for the decrease in value. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll! With the money being worth 27.1% less, I need to adjust my expectations. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable considering the current value of the money. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
