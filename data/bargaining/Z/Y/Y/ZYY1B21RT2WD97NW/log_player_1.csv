"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""}

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable, this offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""bob_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Come on, meet me in the middle!""}

I'm still willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much. The money is worth 10% less than the original amount, but I'm keeping my offer relatively high to see if Bob will bite. Let's see what he thinks!"
