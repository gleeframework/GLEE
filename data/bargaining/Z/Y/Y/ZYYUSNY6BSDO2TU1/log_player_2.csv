"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This seems like a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a decent initial offer, I'm going to reject it.  The game mechanic favors me in the long run, as my money loses value slower than Alice's.  I want to see how far I can push for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a fairer split, Alice.  Let's see what you think of this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob, but this deal accounts for the decreasing value. Time is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still going to reject.  While the offer is a slight improvement for me, I'm confident that I can push for a better deal.  The value of the money is decreasing for both of us, but I'm losing value at a slower rate, giving me an advantage in the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still aiming for a more balanced split. I'm willing to compromise, but let's find a deal that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and this money is losing value fast.  My offer is still better for you than waiting much longer. Let's be realistic and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is slightly better than the previous round, but I'm still confident that I can negotiate a more favorable split.  The time pressure is building, but I'm still losing value at a slower rate than Alice.  I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with every round. Let's find a compromise that's fair and gets us both some value before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. It's the most rational choice at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a turning point.  While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting us both hard now.  Accepting an even split ensures we both get something, and the risk of waiting for a better deal is too high.  The value of the money is simply decreasing too rapidly at this point."
