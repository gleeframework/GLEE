Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a fairer split, Alice.  Let's see what you think of this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand your point, Bob, but this deal accounts for the decreasing value. Time is ticking!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still aiming for a more balanced split. I'm willing to compromise, but let's find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and the deal is getting worse for me with each round that passes.  While it's getting worse for Bob too, his rate of loss is higher, so he's incentivized to make a deal soon. I'll push for a more reasonable offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time, and this money is losing value fast.  My offer is still better for you than waiting much longer. Let's be realistic and close this deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every round. Let's find a compromise that's fair and gets us both some value before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate, and his offers are getting worse! He's clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation.  I need to hold firm and wait for a better offer. He'll have to be more reasonable soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. It's the most rational choice at this point.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting increasingly unreasonable, but he's also clearly feeling the pressure. I'm offering a 50/50 split to show that I'm serious about getting this deal done, but not willing to be taken advantage of. He needs to realize that we both lose if this goes on much longer."
