Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I'm being generous here. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53

**Reasoning:**

Even though the offer seems closer to the middle, the inflation is severely hurting Bob. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain. It's worth risking a counter-offer, pushing for a slightly better split, and hoping Alice feels the pressure of the shrinking pot."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and end this before inflation eats away any more.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a strong play.  The inflation is significantly impacting Bob, and while Alice is also affected, it's not as drastic. Offering a 50/50 split:

* **Highlights fairness:**  It directly addresses the shrinking pot and emphasizes the shared loss due to inflation.
* **Creates pressure:**  Alice might be tempted to drag this out, but the longer it goes, the less valuable the money becomes for both. This offer gives her a clear choice: take a fair deal now or risk getting a worse outcome later. 
* **Avoids a stalemate:**  Continuing to inch up offers could lead to a point where neither side is willing to budge, resulting in a lose-lose scenario."
