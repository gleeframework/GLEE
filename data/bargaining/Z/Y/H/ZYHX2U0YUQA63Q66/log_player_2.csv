"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I think a 70-30 split is fairer, considering the value of the money decreases with each round. Let's get this done quickly!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with 55-45. Don't let the money lose more value! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. My share is worth less with each round, and there's no guarantee Alice will make a better offer in the future."
