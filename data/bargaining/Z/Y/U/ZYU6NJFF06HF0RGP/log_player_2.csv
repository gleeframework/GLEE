"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. We can always renegotiate later if you're not happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think 40% for me is a more reasonable starting point, considering I'm taking the risk of inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much in your favor.  Let's meet in the middle at 70/30.  Remember, your share is worth less with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm still not satisfied with the offer, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a better deal. Alice is trying to use the pressure of inflation to get me to accept a less favorable offer, but I'll try to resist that pressure for now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 350000, ""alice_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve more than 30%. Let's try 35% for me. I'm aware of the inflation risk, but I'm hoping we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement soon.""}"
