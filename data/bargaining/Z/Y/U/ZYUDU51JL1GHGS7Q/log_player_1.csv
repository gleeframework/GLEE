"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less now.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous for me, Bob. I want more.""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I want a higher share of the remaining money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth significantly less now.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you've convinced me. I'll take 40% and we can end this.""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer because, with the inflation, the difference between 40% and 60% is less significant, and I'd rather end the game now than risk further erosion of the value of the money."
