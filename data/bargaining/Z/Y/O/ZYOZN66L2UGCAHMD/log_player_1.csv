"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving away too much.""
}
```

This offer gives me $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm offering a more equitable split, but I'm not giving away the farm. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I would gain in this offer is worth 20% less than the $1,000,000, which is $800,000. And Bob's gain is worth 10% less, which is $540,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there yet, Bob. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, and I'll make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less than the previous round, which is 0.8 * $800,000 = $640,000. And the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, which is 0.9 * $540,000 = $486,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk I'm taking.""
}
```

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
