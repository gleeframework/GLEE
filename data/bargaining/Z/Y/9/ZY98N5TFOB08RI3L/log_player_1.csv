Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount. You can't expect everything to be split 50/50 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
