"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering I'll be taking the risk of being rejected and losing money in the next round. Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, remember the inflation factor. In the next round, if I reject this offer, I'll be the one proposing, and the money will be worth 5% less for me, but 20% less for Alice. This means I can potentially get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you want to share fairly, but with the inflation factor, this deal works better for both of us. I'm taking a smaller risk by offering you more now, as you'll lose a significant portion of your share in the next round.""}
