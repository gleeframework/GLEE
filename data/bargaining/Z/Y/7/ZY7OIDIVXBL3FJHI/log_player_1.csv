"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm going to try and get as much as possible in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less for me in subsequent rounds.  I'm offering Bob $1, hoping he'll take it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something, the 400,000 I'd get is significantly less than the 999,999 I was hoping for in the first round. I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but still trying to secure a larger share for myself.  I'm factoring in the inflation and hoping this offer is attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Even with inflation, 300,000 is less than the 550,000 I was offering in the previous round. I think I can still get a better deal if I hold out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to finally reach a compromise. I'm willing to take a bigger hit from inflation, but I think this offer is fair considering the diminishing value of my share and the risk of getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. With the inflation, my share is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.  While I'm not getting the ideal amount, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round.  It's time to cut my losses and take what I can."
