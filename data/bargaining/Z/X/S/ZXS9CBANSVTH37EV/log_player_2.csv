"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
This is a very unfair offer, and it's likely that Alice will not accept any proposals that leave her with less than 900,000.  It's worth seeing if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
Let's start with a more equitable offer. I'm willing to give Alice 100,000, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20000 
# Alice gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still being very greedy, and her offer isn't much better than the first one. It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal, as there are still many rounds to go."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but I still need a significant share to make this worth my time. It's important to secure a deal quickly as Alice's gains are decreasing with each round."
