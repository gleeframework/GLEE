"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take $1, I'll take the rest.  We can always adjust later. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise, 40% for me, 60% for you.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that I think is more reasonable than Alice's initial proposal. I'm willing to accept less than half of the total amount, considering the inflation that will occur in subsequent rounds. I've also included a message to Alice, suggesting that this is a compromise and a fair starting point for our negotiations. Let's see how she responds!"
