"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider a fair and reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be more aggressive this time.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering I'm the one who made the first proposal. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob, but I'm still holding out for a bit more!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. My message is a bit more assertive, hinting that I'm not willing to budge much from my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to squeeze out a bit more, but I'm getting close to accepting! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze out a bit more, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

Let me think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. With the money I'll get ($5,200) and considering the value of money is decreasing with each round, I think this is a good deal. I'm willing to compromise and end the game here."
