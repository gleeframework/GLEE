Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer gives you a slight edge considering the inflation, but also ensures I get a reasonable share. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses.

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is steadily decreasing as a proportion of the total.  I need to hold out for a better offer to make up for the losses from inflation."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It acknowledges the inflation you're facing while still providing me with a decent share. We need to agree now before this deal gets any worse for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tricky situation. While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is clearly entrenched and unwilling to budge much. Accepting this offer cuts my losses. Waiting any longer risks an even lower offer from Bob, and the inflation will only worsen the situation for me."
