"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair share!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, and leaving 20% for Bob. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm looking forward to Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the 40% gain for me, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept this offer.
