"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my potential gain of $5000 in this round is worth only 80% of its original value, which is $4000.

I accept Bob's offer:
{""decision"": ""accept""}"
