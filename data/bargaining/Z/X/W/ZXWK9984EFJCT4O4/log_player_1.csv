"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get something rather than risking a worse deal in the next round."
