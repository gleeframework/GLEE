"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a significant portion to settle this quickly. Time is money, after all. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I know the money will be worth less in future rounds if we don't reach a deal. I'll see if I can get a better share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm taking a slight risk here, but I believe I'm offering a fair split considering the inflation factor. Let's finalize this before the money loses more value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both value a fair deal. Let's split this evenly and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to budge further. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money, and with the inflation factor, any further rounds would only decrease my share further."
