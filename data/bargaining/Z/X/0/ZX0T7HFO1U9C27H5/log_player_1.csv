"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I would actually receive $480,000 (60% of $800,000, which is 80% of the original $1,000,000).

I will reject this offer since I would prefer to get more than $480,000. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of the original value due to two rounds of 20% inflation, I will aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the remaining $400,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to three rounds of 20% inflation, I would actually receive $520,000 (60% of $850,000, which is 85% of the original $1,000,000).

I will accept this offer since it's better than my previous offers and the inflation has reduced the value of the money.
