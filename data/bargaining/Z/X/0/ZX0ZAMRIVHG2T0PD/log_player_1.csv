"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the money evenly, giving each of us $500,000. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a small share, but I'm taking the majority 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'm not getting as much as I would have in the previous round. On the other hand, Bob is offering me a smaller share, but it's still a significant amount.

I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, take the crumbs if you want 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm getting a much smaller share than I was hoping for.

However, I don't have much choice at this point. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or risk going into the next round with an even smaller potential gain.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise in future rounds.
