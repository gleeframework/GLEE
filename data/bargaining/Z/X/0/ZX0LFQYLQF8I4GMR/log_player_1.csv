"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and we don't know how many rounds we'll play."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $6,400 (80% of the original $8,000). Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'd be getting $5,700 (85% of the original $6,700).

Considering the new numbers, I'd like to reject Bob's offer and propose a new one.
