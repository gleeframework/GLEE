"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining 60%. This way, we both get a significant amount of money and can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a more balanced split, let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll consider the adjusted amounts. 

In this round, I'll gain $400,000, but it's worth 10% less than in the previous round, so it's equivalent to $360,000 in the first round's value. Bob will gain $600,000, but it's worth 20% less, so it's equivalent to $480,000 in the first round's value.

Considering the adjusted values, I think this is a more balanced split, and I'm willing to accept the offer.
