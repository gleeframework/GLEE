Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep $95 and give Bob $5. This is a fair offer as it accounts for the fact that I will be making the first offer and the money will be worth less to me in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'll offer Bob $10 and keep $90 for myself. Even though the money is worth less to me now, I'm still confident in being able to secure a majority of the funds. This offer is fair, given the potential of further inflation in future rounds."
