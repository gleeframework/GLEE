"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this gives Bob a decent amount, and it leaves me with a large majority of the money. Since I'm the one making the offer, I'll take advantage of the fact that I'm the only one aware of inflation for now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept this offer. The inflation is hitting hard, and this will give me at least something. If I reject, I have no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything in the next round, and I might end up with nothing."
