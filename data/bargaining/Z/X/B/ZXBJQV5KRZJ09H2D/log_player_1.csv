I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent share while still allowing me to receive the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share to 80% and increasing Bob's to 20% to incentivize acceptance.  While I'm still getting the majority, this demonstrates a willingness to compromise and move towards a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is still heavily skewed in Bob's favor, and with the inflation rate, it's not a good deal for me. I will continue to propose offers that are more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to compromise, this time offering Bob a 30% share. While the inflation is starting to take a toll, I believe this offer shows a genuine attempt to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more balanced split, it's still significantly in his favor. The inflation is making his share more valuable than mine, and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm now offering Bob a 40% share, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, even with the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob is getting closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is making his share worth significantly more than mine. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With the inflation severely impacting both of us, I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option at this stage, as we're both losing value with every round.  It's time to compromise and secure something before the money becomes worthless."
