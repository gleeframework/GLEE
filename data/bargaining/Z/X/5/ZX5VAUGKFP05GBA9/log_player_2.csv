"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm happy to share 60% with you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer seems fair at first glance, I know that the value of the money will decrease with each round, and I can potentially get a better deal for myself later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this time. I'm offering you 40%, which is still a fair share considering the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm still concerned about the inflation. Let's split it 55/45, with you getting the bigger share this time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
Considering the inflation and the fact that Alice is offering me a larger share, accepting this offer seems like the best option. It's a significant improvement from the first round, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round."
