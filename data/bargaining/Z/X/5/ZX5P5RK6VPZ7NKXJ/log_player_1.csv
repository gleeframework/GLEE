```

  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. The message is a friendly gesture to start the game."

# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the $100 is now worth $95 to me.

I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to split it 50/50 so early. I'd like to propose something else.""
}
