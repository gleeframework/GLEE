"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your starting offer was quite low, Alice. I'm willing to be more generous, but this needs to be fairer.  Let's split the difference from your proposal - this benefits us both as we avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
