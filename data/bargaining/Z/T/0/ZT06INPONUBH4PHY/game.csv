3000.0,7000.0,"My turn! How about a 70/30 split? This accounts for the time value of money, and it's only fair I get a larger share since you'll benefit from the delay tactic more.",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is too lopsided. Let's split it 60/40. This still gives you a larger share and acknowledges the time value of money, but it's more equitable.",Alice,3,

4000.0,6000.0,"Okay, let's switch it up.  I'll do 60/40, but with me taking the larger share.  The clock is ticking!",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"We're getting closer!  Let's split this 50/50. It's the fairest option, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement before the money's worth nothing!",Alice,5,
