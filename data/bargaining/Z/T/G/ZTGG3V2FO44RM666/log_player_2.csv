Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be fair and split it down the middle.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While the deal is getting ""better"" from her perspective, I need to hold out for a more significant shift towards a fairer split.  The rate of inflation is decreasing, so my bargaining position is slowly improving."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my guns. 50/50 is the only fair deal.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to agree to a 50/50 split yet, but it's important to be firm. This shows her I'm serious about getting a fair deal and won't be pressured into accepting less. By repeating the offer, I'm hoping she'll see it as a stable option compared to her increasingly risky demands."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, the rate of inflation makes this the best offer I'm likely to get from Alice. Holding out any longer risks a worse deal in later rounds where the inflation will eat even more into my potential gains. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting even less later."
