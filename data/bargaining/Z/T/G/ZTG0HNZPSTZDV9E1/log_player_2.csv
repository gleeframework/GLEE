Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with this offer. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is devaluing faster for her. While her offer might seem ""generous"" given the inflation, it's important to remember the original value. She's still getting a significantly larger chunk.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally moving closer to a more even split, likely realizing time is running out. However,  she's still angling for a larger share even though the value is plummeting faster for her. I need to hold firm and push for a better deal while it's still worth something."
