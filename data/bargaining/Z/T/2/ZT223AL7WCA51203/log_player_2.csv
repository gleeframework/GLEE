I'm going to reject Alice's offer. It's a reasonable starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Since I know about the inflation, I have an advantage and can try to push for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is more fair, reflecting the risks of this game.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're pushing for 60-40, but I'm not backing down. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I don't want to risk losing all the money.  With the inflation factor, it's a decent deal to get 4500."
