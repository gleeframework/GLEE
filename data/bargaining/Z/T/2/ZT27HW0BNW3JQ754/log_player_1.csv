"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
``` 

I propose taking 99 dollars and giving Bob 1 dollar.  This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping to secure most of the money in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing.  Bob is offering a significant share, and the threat of inflation makes it unwise to gamble."
