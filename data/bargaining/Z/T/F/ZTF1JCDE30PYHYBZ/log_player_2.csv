Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but a 60/40 split is still too lopsided.  I'm willing to compromise with a 55/45 split. This is a fairer offer and avoids further losses due to inflation. What do you say?
