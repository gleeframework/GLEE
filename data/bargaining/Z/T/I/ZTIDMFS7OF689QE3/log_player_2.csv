"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 400000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share for starting. How about a split that favors me a bit more now?  We can still both walk away with a good amount.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but the split needs to reflect the decreasing value of the money over time. This offer is fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer in round 3 is better than what I proposed in round 2, considering the inflation. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout before the money value decreases further. Delaying for a slightly better deal is too risky at this point."
