"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $70 is now worth $65.50 in the second round.

Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, which is a reasonable proposal. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
