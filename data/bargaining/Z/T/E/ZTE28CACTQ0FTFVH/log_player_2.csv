"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is still too lopsided. Let's try 60/40. Remember, the inflation will affect you more, so it's in your best interest to agree now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
