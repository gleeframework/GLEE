"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of my gain in terms of the initial $1,000,000.

My gain would be 300,000, which is 30% of the total amount. That's a significant decrease from my initial proposal of 60%.

Considering Bob's message, I think he's trying to negotiate a better deal for himself. However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 70-30 split.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer. Let's see if he accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think this is still a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not convinced yet.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of my gain in terms of the initial $1,000,000.

My gain would be 400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. That's still a bit too low for me.

However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will stick to his word.
