Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's go with 55/45 in my favor this time.  We can continue to negotiate if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
