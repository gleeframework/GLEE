"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can see how the game goes from here."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share to start, but I'm willing to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, I need to think carefully about the value of the money.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I need to take that into account when making my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think about whether I'm willing to give him a larger share now, knowing that the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round.

I'll reject this offer for now.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. I'll offer a 55/45 split, hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle at 55/45!""
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger share, but I'll still give you a decent cut! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to take a toll on the value of the money! With Bob's gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be very careful about the value of the money.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a 70/30 split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll try to hold out for a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take a firmer stance and offer a 60/40 split, hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to go as low as 30%.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me at 60/40, it's a fair deal!""

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a big risk, but I think I can get a better deal later if I push for more now! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With Bob's gain being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm starting to get concerned that I'll be left with very little if I don't act soon.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving Bob an 80/20 split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. However, I'm also worried that if I reject this offer and Bob pushes for an even higher share in the next round, I might end up with even less.

Given the circumstances, I'll accept this offer, hoping to salvage what's left of the money.
