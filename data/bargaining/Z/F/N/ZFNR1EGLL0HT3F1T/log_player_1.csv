"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total, and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You gave me too little last round, now it's my turn to make a strong offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $3,200.

I don't think Bob's offer is very generous, considering the inflation. I'd like to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $6,400 is worth 64% of what it was in the first round, which is $6,400 / 0.8 = 8,000, but due to the inflation from the first round, it is actually 64% of 8000, so 5120. However, since we are calculating the value of the money at each round, I will calculate it as 6400. I'll keep that in mind and make a new offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this round, but don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,600, which is 36% of the total, and keeping $6,400 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I want a bigger share this round 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,500 is worth 44.8% of what it was in the first round, which is $4,500 / 0.768 = 5846.05, but since we are calculating the value of the money at each round, I will calculate it as 4500.

I'm not sure if this offer is better than my previous one, considering the inflation. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal.
