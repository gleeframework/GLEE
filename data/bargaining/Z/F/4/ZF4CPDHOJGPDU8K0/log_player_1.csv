"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a relatively equal split, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being cautious, but willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Since my money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll accept this offer to get something.
