Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation, Bob. Let's find a middle ground. I'll take 54, you take 46.  This way, we both get a decent share after the losses. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54
