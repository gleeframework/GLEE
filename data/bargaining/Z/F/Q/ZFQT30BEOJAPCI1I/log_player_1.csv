"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 80-20 in my favor""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the total amount is $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going for 80-20! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not go to the next round if I can get a better deal now. I'll accept this offer.
