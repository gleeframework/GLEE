"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob 40% of the total amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is even more generous than mine! However, I need to consider the inflation factor. Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's still a decent split, even with the reduced value of the money.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
