"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, hoping to get a better deal this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the original proposal was 50/50 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less, I'll have to be even more cautious with this offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and trying to get a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the value of the money is decreasing.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
