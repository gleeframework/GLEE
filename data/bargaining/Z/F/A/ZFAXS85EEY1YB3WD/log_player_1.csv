"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get the majority of the money to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, my friend! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $475,000. Bob's gain of $500,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $450,000.

I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle, but I think it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the money. I'll accept the offer.
