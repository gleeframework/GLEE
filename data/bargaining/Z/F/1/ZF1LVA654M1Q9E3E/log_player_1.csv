"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, that's a good start, but I'm hoping for more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so if Bob's offer is 40, that's equivalent to 32 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 is a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving Bob too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I can do better than that 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 48.8% less, so if Bob's offer is 50, that's equivalent to 26.4 in the first round.

I'm surprised Bob is willing to meet me in the middle, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for a 50-50 split. I'll think about it for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm hoping to get a bit more out of the deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more for myself, while still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think I'm getting closer to what I want 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 67.23% less, so if Bob's offer is 42, that's equivalent to 12.5 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 58-42 split, but I'm getting a bit desperate to end the game. I'll think about it for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm not sure if I can do better, but I'll try to squeeze out a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you the majority, but I need a bit more than 42!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob the majority. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him."
