"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, a fair and simple solution 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better deal, especially considering the inflation that's affecting my gains. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me a slightly larger share than before. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not willing to give away too much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much either 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer this time. Although I was hoping for a better deal, I'm starting to realize that the money is losing value due to inflation, and I don't want to risk going to another round and getting an even worse deal. The 45-55 split is not ideal, but it's better than the 48.8% loss I'd face if I rejected this offer and went to the next round."
