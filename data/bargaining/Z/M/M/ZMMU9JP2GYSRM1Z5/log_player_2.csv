"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but we can work something out in the future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I'm motivated to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, Alice's initial offer seems too skewed in her favor, so I'll reject it and propose a more balanced division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation I'm facing.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer a division that gives me $4,500 and Alice $5,500. Given the impact of inflation on my potential earnings, I believe this offer strikes a fair balance between our interests. I've included a message to Alice suggesting that we find a middle ground, taking into account the diminishing value of the money for me in each subsequent round."
