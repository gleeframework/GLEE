"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take $40, it's only round 1 and the money will be worth a lot less in future rounds. I'll try to get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money evenly, but since you took a larger share last round, I'm offering you a slightly smaller share this time. Let's be reasonable and get this done."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's compromise and decrease both our shares a bit. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can end this before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though Alice is proposing a compromise, it's still a worse deal than the first round. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""We're losing money with each round. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share than what you offered. Let's split it 55/45, so we can both get a decent amount."" 
}
