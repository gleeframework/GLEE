"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, but I'm not going for it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, but still a reasonable compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer. 4500 is a good chunk of change, and I don't want to risk going to another round!"
