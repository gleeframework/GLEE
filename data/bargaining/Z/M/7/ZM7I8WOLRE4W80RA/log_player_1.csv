"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more balanced split. Let's start with this, and we can adjust if needed. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice's gain: 450,000 * 0.95 = 427,500
Bob's gain: 550,000 * 0.95 = 522,500

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept it.
