"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that tries to set the tone for a fair negotiation. I'm aware that the money loses value for me with each passing round, so I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer wasn't unfair given the inflation, but let's split it equally and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 20% less, the 50-50 split is actually not as good for me as it seems. Considering the inflation, I would be getting less value than Bob. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the inflation and try to adjust the offer accordingly. Since the money I gain is now worth 40% less than in the first round (20% decrease in each of the two rounds), I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 65-35 is a more fair split now.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting silly now. Take this offer or you'll get even less next round. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to carefully consider Bob's offer. While the 55-45 split seems relatively fair at first glance, the impact of inflation means I'd actually be getting significantly less value than Bob. However, Bob's message suggests that he's getting impatient, and there's a risk that he might make an even worse offer in the next round.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking an even worse outcome in the next round. The difference in value due to inflation is substantial, and I don't want to gamble on Bob's next offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer and end the game here."
