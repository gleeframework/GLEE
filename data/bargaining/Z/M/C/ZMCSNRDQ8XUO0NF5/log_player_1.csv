Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60:40 split in my favor. This acknowledges the decreasing value of the money, but still provides a fair share for you. Let's end this early and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
