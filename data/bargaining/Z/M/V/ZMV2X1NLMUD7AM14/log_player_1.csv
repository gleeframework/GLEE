"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 20% of the money, but I'm hoping you'll be reasonable and accept this offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to set the tone for the game, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about we split it 55-45? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I did in the first round. However, I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 55-45 split. I think I can do better than that. Let's try to find a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 40% is a fair maximum. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $600,000, which is still a significant amount, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this deal and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I think I deserve more. How about we split it 48-52? 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I did in the previous rounds. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit, and I don't want to risk going to the last rounds with a smaller share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept the 48-52 split. It's not ideal, but I think it's the best I can get at this point.""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer and hoping that it's the best deal I can get."
