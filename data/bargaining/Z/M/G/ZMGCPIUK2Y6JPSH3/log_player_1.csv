"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, my proposal is now more favorable to me. I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
