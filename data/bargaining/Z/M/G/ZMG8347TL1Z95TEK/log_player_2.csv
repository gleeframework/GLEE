"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and we can negotiate from there.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate will affect us both differently. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go for a simple 50/50 split. Inflation is a factor for both of us, so it makes sense to compromise and divide the money evenly. This way, we both get something, and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
