"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Considering the decreasing value of money for me, this is a good deal for both of us.  Accept and we can end this game.   
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
