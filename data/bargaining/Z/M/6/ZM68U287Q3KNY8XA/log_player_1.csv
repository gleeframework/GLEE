Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10.  I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'm getting less than my initial offer, it's still a decent amount, and with the inflation, I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round.  It's time to take what I can get!"
