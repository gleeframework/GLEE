"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly better offer, but still a bit generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

I'll calculate the actual amounts I'd gain:

* My gain: 4000
* Bob's gain: 6000

Considering the inflation, my gain is actually worth 80% of the original amount (since 20% less is 80% of the original). So, my actual gain would be 4000 * 0.8 = 3200.

Bob's gain, on the other hand, is worth 90% of the original amount (since 10% less is 90% of the original). So, his actual gain would be 6000 * 0.9 = 5400.

Considering the reduced value, I'm not too thrilled about this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me again, I'll make a new offer taking that into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fairer split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd gain, considering the reduced value due to inflation:

* My gain: 5200
* Bob's gain: 4800

Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, my actual gain would be 5200 * 0.5162 (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%, and 51.2% is the same as 0.512). This means my actual gain would be approximately 2684.24.

Bob's gain, on the other hand, is worth 72.9% of the original amount (since 27.1% less is 72.9% of the original). So, his actual gain would be 4800 * 0.729 = 3495.2.

Considering the reduced value, I'm still not thrilled about this offer. I'd like to try to get a bit more.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me again, I'll make a new offer taking that into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 58/42 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd gain, considering the reduced value due to inflation:

* My gain: 5000
* Bob's gain: 5000

Since the money is worth 67.23% less for me, my actual gain would be 5000 * 0.323 (since 100% - 67.23% = 32.77%, and 32.77% is the same as 0.3277). This means my actual gain would be approximately 1619.5.

Considering the reduced value, I'm actually getting a better deal than I initially thought, and I'm not sure I want to reject this offer. I think I'll take it.
