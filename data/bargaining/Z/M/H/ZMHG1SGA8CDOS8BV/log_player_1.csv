"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to make the game worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my initial offer, since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less.

I accept Bob's offer.
