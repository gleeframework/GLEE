"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk to start.  Let's see if you're happy with that. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though it's a ""decent chunk"", it's still a very small portion. There's a high chance I can get more if I reject and make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split. Let's work together to reach an agreement.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair share after inflation.  Let's split the difference from your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to get more, it's likely the inflation will continue to hurt me.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something and avoids potentially getting nothing in future rounds."
