"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice a significant portion of the money, but also leaves Bob with a reasonable amount. This aims to make Bob think about accepting the offer while also ensuring that Alice gets the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

This offer is a compromise from my initial offer. Since Bob rejected my first offer and countered with a significantly lower share for me, I'm adjusting my offer slightly, hoping to find a middle ground that he will find more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is significantly impacting Bob's gains.  Accepting this offer secures a decent portion of the money, and further rounds might result in a worse deal for me due to the escalating inflation."
