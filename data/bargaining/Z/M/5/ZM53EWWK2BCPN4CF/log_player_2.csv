Even though inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Here's why:

* **Further rounds worsen the situation:**  Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll be making an offer in the next round.  But the inflation rate is far more punishing to you than to Alice. 
* **Minimal difference in gain:**  While Alice is getting a larger share, the difference between her proposed $480,000 and what she might try to get in the next round (after the inflation hits you harder) isn't significant enough to risk getting much less.

It's a bit of a gamble, but taking this offer is likely to be the most beneficial outcome for Bob in this scenario."
