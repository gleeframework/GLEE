"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal Bob. I believe this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} \n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can find a better balance, considering the inflation, I believe this is a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The value is decreasing rapidly for both of us, but especially for me. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take it. The offer seems reasonable considering the rapid decrease in value, especially for Alice. No sense in risking further loss."
