"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide the money while it's still worth something, Bob. This seems like a fair split to me. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share Alice, but my offer is more balanced. Let's not let this money depreciate any further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, our money is losing value fast.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair offer considering the depreciation.  Let's be sensible and take the deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out! I'm meeting you in the middle - let's close this deal before the money is worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures I get something rather than risking nothing at all as the rounds progress."
