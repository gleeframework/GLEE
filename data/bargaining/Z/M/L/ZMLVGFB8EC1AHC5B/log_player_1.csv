"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 80-20, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm also trying to get a good chunk of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer. Let's start with this and see if we can find a better solution for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to aim for a higher share, can we discuss further?""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer, but I'm open to negotiating further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for this. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a higher share to account for the inflation""
}
```"
