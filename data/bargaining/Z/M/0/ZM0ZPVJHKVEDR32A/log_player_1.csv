"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the risk of inflation and the possibility that Bob might try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting now versus waiting for a potentially better offer.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In the third round, my potential gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%). I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```"
