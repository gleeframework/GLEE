"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split things a bit more evenly this time.  It's important to get this settled early.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll lower my initial offer a bit, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Inflation is eating away at our potential gains. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting desperate, but I'm not budging much. My new offer is still in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse with each round due to inflation, accepting this offer would mean I get even less value than before.  It's time to show Alice I'm serious about a more equitable split, even if it means risking another rejection."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to accept slightly less to get this done. Let's be reasonable and end this before inflation destroys the value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting more desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up much. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation has significantly eroded my potential gains. While this offer is far from ideal, rejecting it risks even worse outcomes in future rounds, where I'll be forced to accept increasingly smaller shares just to get anything.  It's painful, but at this point, cutting my losses and taking the deal is the most logical choice."
