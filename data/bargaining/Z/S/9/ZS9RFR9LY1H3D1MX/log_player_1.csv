"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000.  It's a big advantage for me, but I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, taking $1000 is better than risking getting nothing in the next round due to inflation."
