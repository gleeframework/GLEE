# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. It's not fair that Alice gets 90% of the money! I think we can do better than that.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'm ready to negotiate!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find some middle ground. I propose a 70/30 split, closer to your last offer, but still giving me a slight advantage. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although Alice is trying to find middle ground, I think I can still get a better deal.
