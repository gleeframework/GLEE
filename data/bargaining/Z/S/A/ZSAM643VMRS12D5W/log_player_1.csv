"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000. I think this is a fair start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of $900,000, which is $855,000, and Bob's gain is now worth 90% of $100,000, which is $90,000.

I don't think meeting in the middle is a good idea, as I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation. I'd like to try to get a better deal.
