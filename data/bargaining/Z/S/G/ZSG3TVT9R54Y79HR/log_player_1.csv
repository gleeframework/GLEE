Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it right down the middle.  We both get a good share, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
