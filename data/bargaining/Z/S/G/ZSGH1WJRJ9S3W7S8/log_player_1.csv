"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  A 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the 50/50 split. I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the money is worth less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less again! I need to be strategic.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a fair share too.  Let's aim for a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the 55-45 split. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than risking going into further rounds with the money's value decreasing even more."
