Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, how about a compromise? 55/45 seems fair considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting late, and this is a reasonable offer considering the inflation. Let's split the money and move on."
