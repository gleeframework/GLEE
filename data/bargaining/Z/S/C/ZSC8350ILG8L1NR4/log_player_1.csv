Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think 80/20 is a more reasonable split considering the current market conditions. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
