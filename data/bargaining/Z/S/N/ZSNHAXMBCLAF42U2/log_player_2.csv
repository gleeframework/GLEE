Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and split it closer to 60/40, giving me a slightly larger share to account for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more realistic split, accepting 40% when I started at a potential 50% is still a significant loss. Inflation is hurting, but it's not yet at a point where this offer is acceptable. I need to push for a better deal in the next round or two before the devaluation becomes too extreme."
