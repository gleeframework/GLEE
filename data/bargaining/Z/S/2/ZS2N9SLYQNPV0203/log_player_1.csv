"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","For Round 2, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my strategy.

Since Bob's offer is the same as my original offer, I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For Round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth significantly less for me, I'll try to get as much as possible.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
