Round 5

**Reasoning:**

Even though the difference is getting smaller, Alice is still stubbornly aiming for a larger share.  The declining value of the money makes each round more critical for Bob.  It's time to show Alice that Bob is serious about getting a fair deal and willing to risk it all for a 50/50 split."
