Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Counter offer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still hoping we can meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'll hold out for a better deal, knowing time is on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is a fair deal. Take it before inflation eats further into your share.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  This is the fairest deal and highlights how much Alice loses with each round of inflation.  It's a strong negotiating tactic to make this offer now before I potentially offer her even less."
