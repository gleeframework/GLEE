{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 1, I would have gained 49 dollars, which is worth 9.75% less than 100 dollars. To find the value of 49 dollars in the current round, I need to calculate 100 * 0.9075 = 90.75 dollars. 

Since Alice's offer is 50 dollars, which is less than 90.75 dollars, I accept her offer.
