Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on your offer from last round.  60/40 is still a fair split, and I think we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems generous on the surface, the rapidly increasing inflation rate for her means I need to push for a better deal now. Accepting a 40/60 split in round 3 would be a significant loss for me in the long run."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and every round costs us. I'm sticking with a slightly advantageous split for me, but I'm meeting you closer to the middle.  55/45 - take it or leave it!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases, especially for Alice. I need to convey a sense of urgency.
* **Stronger Position:**  My inflation rate is much lower, putting me in a stronger bargaining position as the game progresses. 
* **Slight Concession:** I'm reducing my demand slightly to signal a willingness to negotiate, but not by much. I still aim for a slightly advantageous split."
