"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations and get a guaranteed $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new proposal from Bob, the money I would gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll calculate the actual amount I would gain:

$100,000 * 0.95 = $95,000

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For Round 3, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a smaller amount than before, but still a significant portion of the total. I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations and get a guaranteed $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amount I would gain in Round 4, considering the 14.26% inflation:

$1,000,000 * 0.854 (1 - 0.1426) = $854,000 (initial amount I would gain)
$200,000 * 0.854 (no inflation for Bob's gain) = $171,080 (actual amount I would gain)

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For Round 5, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a smaller amount than before, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations and get a guaranteed $400,000."
