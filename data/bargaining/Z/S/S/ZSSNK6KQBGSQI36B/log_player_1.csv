"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to be cautious. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the value of my share. However, Bob's offer is still quite lopsided in his favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a more balanced offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take its toll on Bob's offer. With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, Bob's offer is still quite skewed in his favor.

I'll try to take advantage of the inflation to my advantage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 65-35, I'll try to push for an even more favorable split. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself.
