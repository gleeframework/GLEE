"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation affects Bob's offer more significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a slightly better deal, but still keeping it relatively balanced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and considering the inflation effect, I'm going to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like Bob is trying to get a slightly better deal, but I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further rounds and get some money."
