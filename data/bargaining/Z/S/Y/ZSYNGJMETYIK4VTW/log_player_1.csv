I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to compromise, I need to ensure a substantial return considering the inflation we're facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is less than I would prefer, the inflation is hitting me hard, and I'm unlikely to get a better deal in the next round.  Accepting this ensures I get something, and I'll be able to take advantage of the next round's inflation and potentially make a better offer then."
