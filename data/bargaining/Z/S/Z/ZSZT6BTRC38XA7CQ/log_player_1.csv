I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, this offer is still decent given the inflation factor.  It's better to get something than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
