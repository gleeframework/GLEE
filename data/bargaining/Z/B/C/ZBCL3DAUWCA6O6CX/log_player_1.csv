"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer, hoping Bob will be willing to accept it in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game! I'm not going to let Bob get away with such a lopsided deal.  Let's see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to offer a fair split this time.  Hopefully, Bob will realize that continuing to fight over the money will only result in both of us getting nothing."
