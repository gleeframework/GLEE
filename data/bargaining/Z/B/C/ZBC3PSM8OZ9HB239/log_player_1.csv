"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this initial offer, I, Alice, propose to take $60, leaving $40 for Bob. The message emphasizes the importance of a fair division, especially considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money as the rounds progress. This division gives me a slight advantage but is reasonable enough to encourage Bob to accept, given the decreasing value of money over rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60/40 split, accounting for inflation.  This should give us both a decent outcome.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer because accepting a 40/60 split where I get the smaller share doesn't seem favorable, especially considering the inflation affects me less than Bob. The fact that the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob motivates me to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, let's adjust the split to make it more mutually beneficial. This way, we both get a decent share, and the quicker we agree, the less we lose to inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I slightly reduce my initial proposal to account for the passing rounds and the effect of inflation. By giving Bob a bit more, I aim to make the offer more appealing while still maintaining a favorable position. The message emphasizes the mutual benefit of agreeing sooner rather than later, as inflation continues to reduce the value of our potential gains."
