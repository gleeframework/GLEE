**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting worse for her with each round due to the inflation.  While her tone suggests desperation, there's still a significant gap between her offer and what would be a more even split considering the inflation working in my favor.  I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get a better deal."
