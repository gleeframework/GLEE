"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values I'd get from Alice's offer are:

* My gain: 45 * 0.8 (80% of original value) = 36
* Alice's gain: 55 * 0.81 (81% of original value) = 44.55

I'd rather get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Since Alice's offer was 55-45, I'll try to get a slightly better split for myself.
