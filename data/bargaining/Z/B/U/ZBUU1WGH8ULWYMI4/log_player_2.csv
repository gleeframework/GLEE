"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront since the value decreases for me over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand the time pressure, but let's find a more balanced split. This offer reflects the diminishing value over time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is decreasing, but let's settle this before inflation eats away at the pot. This is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4750, ""alice_gain"": 5250, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the deadline. This offer is a fair compromise considering the time pressure and diminishing value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My offers are getting lower. Meet me in the middle before we both lose! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a slightly better split, Alice is right - this is getting ridiculous. The longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for her, and it's clear she's willing to walk away with nothing if I push too hard. This offer is the same as my Round 2 offer, and repeating that strategy at this point seems unlikely to work. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
