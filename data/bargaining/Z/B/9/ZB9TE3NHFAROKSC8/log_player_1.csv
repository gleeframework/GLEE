"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is still quite generous to Bob, but I'll have to consider the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money's value decreasing by 20% each round, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 42% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob gets 58%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! Bob's offer is quite one-sided, and I'll have to think carefully.

However, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'll decide to accept this offer.
