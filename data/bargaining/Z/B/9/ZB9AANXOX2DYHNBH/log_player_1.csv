Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  We both need to get a good share of the money.  I propose a 60/40 split, which is still better for you given the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
