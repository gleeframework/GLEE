**Reasoning:**

While Alice is suggesting a middle ground, the inflation is working heavily in my favor. It's still better for me to hold out for a better deal, even though we're approaching the halfway point."

# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and rightly so. The value of her potential winnings is plummeting. I need to hold firm, the next few rounds should bring me a much more favorable offer as the deadline looms."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Time is running out, this is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close to the end. I'm pushing my advantage with a strong offer, but framing it as my ""final"" one to try and get Alice to concede.  She's likely to be very hesitant to let the game reach a point where she gets nothing."
