Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous here, Bob. Let's split it 90/10 and call it a day. We can both walk away with a good chunk of change.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's meet in the middle. A 60/40 split is fair, and we can both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still heavily in her favor. The devaluation hurts her more than me, so I can afford to be a bit more patient and push for a better deal."

""alice_gain"": 450000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the deadline.  Let's split it evenly and avoid risking losing everything.  A 50/50 split is the most reasonable option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally offering an even split. While I might have been able to squeeze out a slightly better deal in earlier rounds, the inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing to negotiate risks getting nothing at all as we approach the deadline."
