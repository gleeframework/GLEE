"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  Let's end this quickly!""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. Take 60% and I'll take 40% 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While 6000 is better than the 8550 (9000 * 0.95) I'd get if I rejected and then proposed again,  I'm still losing money.  It's better to hold out for a better deal.  Inflation hurts Bob more than it hurts me, so I have the upper hand in this negotiation."

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more. Take 65% and I'll take 35% 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though this is more than my previous offer, I know inflation is affecting Bob much more.  I'm still losing a significant amount of money overall, so I'm going to hold out for a better offer. I'm confident I can get more."

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Look, I'm willing to be generous.  Let's do an 80/20 split. This is my final offer before we both start losing more money.""}
