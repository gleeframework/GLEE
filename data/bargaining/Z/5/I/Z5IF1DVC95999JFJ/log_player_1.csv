"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'm the one who's going to take the risk of inflation! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think it through.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the offer. In this case, I'd be getting $300,000, which is equivalent to $375,000 in the first round.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done!""}

I'm proposing that I get $400,000 and Bob gets $600,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might appeal to Bob."
