Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Come on, Alice. You're losing value every round. It's time to settle. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'm getting a worse deal, continuing to reject risks a further decrease in value and an even worse offer next round. It's time to settle."
