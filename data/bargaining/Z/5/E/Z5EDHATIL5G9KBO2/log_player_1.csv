"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is worth 20% less than the original $1,000,000, his gain of $600,000 is actually equivalent to $480,000 in the original amount. That's a significant difference from the 50-50 split I proposed earlier.

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think about whether I want to accept this offer or wait for a better one. My gain of $400,000 is equivalent to $400,000 in the original amount, which is a bit less than what I initially proposed.

For now, I'll reject the offer and wait for Bob's next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was worth $480,000 in the original amount, I'll make a counteroffer that takes that into account. I'll aim to get a bit more than what I would have gotten in the 50-50 split, considering the inflation effect.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation effect. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation effect. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer.

Since Bob's offer is worth 48.8% less than the original $1,000,000, his gain of $550,000 is actually equivalent to $275,200 in the original amount. That's a significant drop from the $480,000 equivalent he offered in the previous round.

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think about whether I want to accept this offer or wait for a better one. My gain of $450,000 is still worth $450,000 in the original amount, which is a decent amount.

However, I'm not sure if I want to settle for a slightly smaller share this early in the game. I'll reject the offer and wait for Bob's next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that Bob's offers have been decreasing in value due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than the original amount, I'll aim to get a bit more than what I would have gotten in the 50-50 split, considering the inflation effect.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to the original idea of a 50-50 split, but I'm willing to revisit it if you make a better offer.""
}
```

I'm essentially trying to ""buy time"" and see if Bob will make a better offer, while still keeping the door open for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Since Bob's offer is worth 67.23% less than the original $1,000,000, his gain of $525,000 is actually equivalent to $159,075 in the original amount.

Considering the drastic drop in value, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. My gain of $475,000 is still worth $475,000 in the original amount, which is a significant amount.

However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that if I reject this offer, the money might become almost worthless soon. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer against the risk of getting nothing.

For now, I'll reject the offer and wait for Bob's next proposal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really accelerating! Since Bob's offers have been decreasing in value significantly, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Given that Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less than the original amount, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk by offering you a smaller share, but I think it's time for me to take control of the negotiations.""

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Since Bob's offer is worth 79.03% less than the original $1,000,000, his gain of $500,000 is actually equivalent to $80,400 in the original amount.

Considering the drastic drop in value, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. My gain of $500,000 is still worth $500,000 in the original amount, which is a decent amount.

However, I'm starting to think that Bob might be trying to stall for time, waiting for the money to become almost worthless. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer against the risk of getting nothing.

But since this offer is essentially the same as the 50-50 split I proposed in round 5, I'll reject it and wait for Bob's next proposal.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really accelerating! Since Bob's offers have been decreasing in value significantly, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Given that Bob's gain is worth 79.03% less than the original amount, I'll aim to get an even larger share of the remaining money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk by offering you a smaller share, but I think it's time for me to take control of the negotiations. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to get a larger share to make it worth my while.""

However, I'm starting to think that Bob might be trying to stall for time, waiting for the money to become almost worthless. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer against the risk of getting nothing.

But since this offer is essentially a 55-45 split, which is closer to my previous offer, I'll reject it and wait for Bob's next proposal.

Considering the drastic drop in value, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. My gain of $800,000 is still worth $800,000 in the original amount, which is a significant amount.

However, I'm also considering the fact that this is Bob's last offer, and if I reject it, I might get nothing. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer against the risk of getting nothing.

In this case, I think it's better to take the deal, even if it's not ideal. I'll accept the offer.
