"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, leaving Bob with 40%. I've attached a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more equitable, considering we both have to agree to it. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 57,
  ""bob_gain"": 43,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers""
}
```

I'm making a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. I'm proposing a 57/43 split, which is roughly the midpoint between our previous offers. Let's see how Bob responds!"
