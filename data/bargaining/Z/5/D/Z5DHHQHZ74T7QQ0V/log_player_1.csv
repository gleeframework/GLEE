Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

I'll think about it... 

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less.

I'll think about it...

Considering the large difference in gains, I'll accept this offer. It's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the money before it loses even more value.
