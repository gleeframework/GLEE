  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think a 7:3 split in my favor is more equitable given the upcoming inflation. Let's try this and see how it plays out. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
