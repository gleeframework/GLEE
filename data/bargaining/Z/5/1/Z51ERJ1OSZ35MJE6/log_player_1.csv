Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we are running out of time. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI will accept Bob's offer in Round 6. Due to the increasing effects of inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within the 12 rounds, I believe accepting 5100 is a reasonable decision at this point. The difference between our gains is minimal, and further negotiations might lead to a worse outcome for both of us due to the devaluation of the money."
