"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. If Bob accepts, we can end the game and collect our respective shares. If he rejects, I'll make a new proposal for Round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think you can do better 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll consider the adjusted values.

I'm not thrilled with the 70/30 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll think about whether I can do better in the next round.

For now, I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 80 is the minimum I'm comfortable with. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm pushing for an 80/20 split, which is a more favorable outcome for me. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round. I'll consider the adjusted values.

The 75/25 split is a bit more favorable to me than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about whether I can do better in the next round.

For now, I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 5.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to what I want. 85 is my limit. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm pushing for an 85/15 split, which is a more favorable outcome for me. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's try to find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 78 
# Bob gain: 22 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is now worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round. I'll consider the adjusted values.

The 78/22 split is a bit more favorable to me than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'm starting to think that Bob might be getting a bit desperate, so I'll consider accepting this offer.

For now, I'll accept this offer.
