"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I think this is the fairest way to go about it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less than my initial offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good idea to split it evenly, and I'm willing to compromise. I accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
