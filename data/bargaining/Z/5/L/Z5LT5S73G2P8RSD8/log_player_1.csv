"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer splits the money 55% to Alice and 45% to Bob. It is a reasonable starting point, offering a slight advantage to Alice as the first proposer, but not so lopsided that Bob would be likely to reject it outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
``` 
 
This offer splits the money evenly. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, and we're now in a position where the money is worth less, I believe a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and accepting this offer ensures I get at least something. I also anticipate that Bob will continue to offer a similar split in the future, so it's likely that accepting this offer will lead to a better outcome than rejecting it and risking getting nothing in the end."
