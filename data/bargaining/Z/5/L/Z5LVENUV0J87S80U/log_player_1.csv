"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering the inflation will impact you more than me.  Let's be reasonable and finish this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
