"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get the smaller share this round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. I'll explain my reasoning in my message - I'm willing to take the smaller share this round, but I'll get a better deal in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority this round, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my $3,000 gain is worth less than my initial $6,000 gain, and Bob's $7,000 gain is worth even less than my $4,000 gain.

I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this round, but I'm still trying to get a better deal overall.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, where I'll get $4,200 and Bob will get $5,800. I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and give you a slightly larger share this round, but I'm not going to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of money, my $4,500 gain is worth less than my previous $4,200 gain, and Bob's $5,500 gain is worth even less than his previous $5,800 gain.

However, I think this offer is a slightly better deal for me than my previous offer, and it's a compromise from Bob's previous offer. I'll decide to accept this offer.
