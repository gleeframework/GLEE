"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering you 30 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 70 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation. Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll receive 50 * 0.8 = 40 dollars. Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he'll receive 50 * 0.9 = 45 dollars.

I accept this offer.
