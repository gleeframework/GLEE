"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time to switch the roles.  I'll give you a bit less, but I'm sure we can still find a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the original value, so $60 is now worth $48.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 40-60 split, especially since I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, hoping to meet Bob in the middle and find a compromise."
