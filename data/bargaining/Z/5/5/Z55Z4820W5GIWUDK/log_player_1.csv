"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is now worth 10% less than his initial offer, so he's actually offering me $3,600 now.

I'm not impressed with the compromise, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down! You're getting a smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a smaller amount than his previous offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is now worth 27.1% less than his initial offer, so he's actually offering me $3,674.90 now.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I think it's getting closer to what I want. I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50/50 split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money losing more value.
