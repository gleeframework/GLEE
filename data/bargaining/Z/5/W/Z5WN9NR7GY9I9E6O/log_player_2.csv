Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting impatient, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting worse, I still have some leverage. Accepting now would mean losing over 60% of the potential value I could have gotten in round 1.  Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but waiting a bit longer might force her to offer a more reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it before inflation eats away at your share too!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should've taken my previous offer, now it's even less 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While 3500 is far from ideal, it's better than getting nothing in the end.  Alice is clearly unwilling to budge and the value of the money for me will only decrease further. It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
