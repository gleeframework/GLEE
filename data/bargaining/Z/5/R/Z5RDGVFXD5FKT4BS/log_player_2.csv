Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Since we both seem to want a larger share, I think it's time to compromise. Let's split the money evenly this time. It's a fair deal considering the inflation, and it avoids further rounds where we both lose money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
