"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the bigger share but still leave you something.  Accept this and we'll both have something to work with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a proposal that's more in my favor. The current offer doesn't seem fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more balanced, considering the inflation that affects me. I'll aim for a larger share to compensate for the potential loss in value over the rounds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still taking the majority. If you reject this, remember, inflation is hurting you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. The threat of inflation is noted, but I'm willing to take that risk for now to try and secure a larger share.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the impact of inflation and Alice's previous offers, I'll adjust my proposal to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us. However, I'll keep in mind that the value of the money to me is decreasing, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.

{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair. Let's settle on this before it's too late.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting tired of this game.  Let's get this done.  If you reject this, I'm going for the majority in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer because, despite the increasing pressure from inflation and Alice's threat to aim for an even larger share, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting this offer would leave me with significantly less than I've been aiming for, and I'm willing to risk another round to try and secure a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation and Alice's growing impatience. I'll aim to find a compromise that might be acceptable to her while still trying to secure a reasonable share for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 5600, ""alice_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""I understand you're getting tired, but I'm taking a significant hit from inflation. Let's meet in the middle and end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to the end. This is my final offer. If you reject this, I'll be taking the vast majority of the remaining money. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer because, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain and Alice's threat to take the vast majority if I reject, this seems like the best deal I can get at this point. Continuing to reject offers risks leaving me with even less due to inflation and Alice's increasing share.
