"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Will you accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is the same as mine, but since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll need to adjust my calculation.

The original offer was $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Bob. With 5% inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000. Similarly, Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $570,000.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as my original offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% total inflation so far (5% in the first round and 5% in the second round).

My offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. Will you accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's calculate the value of the offer considering the 19.26% total inflation (5% + 5% + 9.26% from the 14.26% increase in the last round).

My gain of $450,000 is now worth 80.74% of its original value, which is $361,730. Bob's gain of $550,000 is now worth 80.74% of its original value, which is $443,070.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as my previous offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 24.26% total inflation (5% + 5% + 14.26%).

My offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 490000, ""bob_gain"": 510000}

I'm offering you $510,000 and keeping $490,000 for myself. Will you accept?"
