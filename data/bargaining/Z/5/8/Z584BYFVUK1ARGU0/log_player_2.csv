"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  Alice loses value in her potential earnings at a much faster rate (20% per round) than Bob (5% per round). It's in her best interest to settle sooner.
* **Fairness and Incentive:** While Alice's initial offer wasn't terrible, it heavily favored her. Offering a slightly higher amount than she would get by waiting a round incentivizes her to accept while still securing a larger share for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet halfway. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both players. It's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers.
* **Acceptable Terms:** While not ideal, getting $5,200 is better than risking getting an even lower amount in future rounds as inflation eats away at the value. A 52/48 split is a decent outcome considering the circumstances. 
* **Alice's Position Weakening:**  Alice's offers are getting better for Bob, indicating her urgency to settle as the value decreases rapidly for her."
