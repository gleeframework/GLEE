"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and reasonable, this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Evaluate the offer
Alice has proposed a division where I, Bob, would receive $400,000 and she would receive $600,000.

## Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation
Since we are in the first round, the money's value has not yet decreased due to inflation. However, if I reject this offer and we proceed to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice.

## Step 3: Calculate the value of money in the next round
If we proceed to the next round, the total value of the money for me would be 80% of $1,000,000, which is $800,000. For Alice, it would be 95% of $1,000,000, which is $950,000.

## Step 4: Determine if the offer is acceptable
Given that the offer gives me $400,000, which is half of what I could potentially get in the next round ($800,000 / 2 = $400,000), and considering Alice's proposal seems to be a good starting point as she mentioned, it might be reasonable to consider accepting this offer. However, since I'm playing to maximize my gain and the offer doesn't seem to take into account the different inflation rates very much, I might want to negotiate further.

## Step 5: Decide on the best course of action
Given the information and the fact that I want to maximize my gain, I will reject the offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","## Step 1: Calculate the current value of the money after inflation
For me, Bob, the money is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $800,000. For Alice, it's worth 95% of its original value, which is $950,000.

## Step 2: Determine a fair division considering inflation
Given the adjusted values, a more inflation-adjusted offer might be closer to the new values we each see. However, since I'm trying to maximize my gain, I'll propose a division that slightly favors me but still appears reasonable considering the adjusted values.

## Step 3: Formulate the offer
I will propose that I receive $450,000 (which is more than half of the $800,000 value I perceive) and Alice receives $550,000 (which is slightly less than the $950,000 value she perceives but still a significant amount).

## Step 4: Attach a message to the offer
My message to Alice will be: ""Considering the inflation impact, this offer adjusts our shares to reflect the current value we each perceive, with a slight adjustment for my increased risk in proceeding to this round.""

## Step 5: Finalize the offer
The offer is as follows: I, Bob, will receive $450,000, and Alice will receive $550,000, with the attached message.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, this offer adjusts our shares to reflect the current value we each perceive, with a slight adjustment for my increased risk in proceeding to this round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing devaluation, especially on your end, I believe this offer is more than fair, taking into account the risk we both face with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Evaluate the offer considering inflation\nAlice has proposed a division where I, Bob, would receive $420,000 and she would receive $580,000. Given the current inflation, the money I gain is worth 36% less than initially, and for Alice, it's 9.75% less.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the perceived value of the offer\nFor me, the $420,000 offer is actually worth less due to the 36% decrease in value. The original $1,000,000 is now worth $640,000 to me (100% - 36% = 64%). For Alice, the $580,000 is from a value slightly decreased by 9.75%, making the original $1,000,000 worth $902,500 to her.\n\n## Step 3: Assess fairness and risk\nAlice's message suggests she believes the offer is more than fair, considering the increasing devaluation, especially on my end. However, I need to assess if accepting $420,000 now is better than risking another round where the money could devalue further.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the potential for future offers\nGiven the trend, future offers might not be more advantageous due to the significant impact of inflation on my side. Each round decreases the value significantly more for me than for Alice, reducing my bargaining power.\n\n## Step 5: Make a decision\nConsidering the devaluation and the risk associated with proceeding, accepting this offer might be the best option to ensure a reasonable gain before the value drops further.\n\nThe final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n```"
