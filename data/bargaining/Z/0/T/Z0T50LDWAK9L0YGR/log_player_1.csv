"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob will accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough for me. I'll make a new offer!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a good compromise. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the reduced value, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering the decreased value of the money, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too low for me. I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough for me. I'll try to negotiate further!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's finalize!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob. I'm hoping this will be the one that sticks!"
