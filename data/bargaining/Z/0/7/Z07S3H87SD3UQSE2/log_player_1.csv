Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I know Bob will be tempted to reject it, but hopefully, he'll see that I'm willing to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  Even though it's worth less due to inflation, I still have a chance to get a better deal in the next round. I'll try to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split this round.  I'm willing to compromise to avoid risking getting a worse deal in the next round, but I'm still aiming for a larger share than Bob's last offer."
