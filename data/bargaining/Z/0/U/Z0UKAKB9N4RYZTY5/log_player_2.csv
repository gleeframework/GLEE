"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle? This deal accounts for the fact that the money is worth less over time, especially for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still on the table.  Let's not waste time with back-and-forth, especially with inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems tempting now that inflation has set in, it's important to remember that it's impacting her far more severely than me.  She'll likely be more desperate in later rounds, giving me a stronger position to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this money.  Let's stop wasting time and split it evenly. This is the fairest deal considering the circumstances.""}"
