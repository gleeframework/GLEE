"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you can have 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not going to accept a 60/40 split right away. Let's see what happens with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think a 55/45 split is fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal share. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the 50/50 split. Inflation is starting to bite, and it's better to have something than risk getting nothing at all."
