Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going any lower than this. Time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is more reasonable, accepting a 50/50 split now means I'm losing potential gains from earlier rounds. Since her devaluation of the money is significantly higher than mine (36% vs 9.75%), time is working in my favor.  I'm hoping to pressure her into a better offer in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going any lower than this. We're both losing money with each round, let's end this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally moving in the right direction, and while it's not the 65% I offered, it's getting close. Considering the time pressure and the fact that my potential gains are diminishing with each round, accepting at 60% is a good compromise to ensure we both walk away with something.  The risk of her dropping her offer significantly in the next round is too high."
