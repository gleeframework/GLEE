"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, giving me 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. A fair and simple solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $450,000.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's a fair and simple solution as Bob says. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
