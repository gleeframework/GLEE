"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100 and give Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd rather aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss. Bob's offer of 50-50 is a good one, but I'd like to try to get a bit more.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm aiming for a slightly higher share to compensate for the 10% loss in value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains. Considering the decreasing value of the money I gain, I'd like to take a more conservative approach. Bob's offer of 40-60 is a bit more favorable to me than my previous offer, and I'd rather not risk going to the next round.

I'll accept this offer.
