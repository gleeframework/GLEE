"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to be more aggressive!

I'll think for a moment... Given that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's my turn again!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

I'll calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. Let's see...

$400,000 is worth about $291,429 in the first round. With 27.1% less, that's around $212,000.

Considering my gain is still $600,000, I think this offer is a bit too generous for Bob. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. It's a bit more skewed towards me, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it this time!"

$300,000 is worth about $182,500 in the first round. With 40.95% less, that's around $108,075.
