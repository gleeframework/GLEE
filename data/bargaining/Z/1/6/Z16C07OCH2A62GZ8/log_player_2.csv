"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but this is the best I can do. The inflation is really starting to hurt us both, so we need to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about the urgency due to inflation, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  We need to push for a more equitable split, knowing that time is working against both of us."
