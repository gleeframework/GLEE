I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a decent amount of money.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even with the inflation, I'm still better off waiting and making a counter-offer in the next round.  Bob's offer is too low for me to accept at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm lowering my offer slightly to try and entice Bob into accepting.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to be more realistic about my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  I'll continue to reject his offers and see if he becomes more reasonable as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still trying to maintain a significant portion of the money.  We're getting closer to the deadline, so I need to find a balance between securing a good deal and risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not appealing, even with the significant inflation on my side. I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still trying to secure a majority of the money. With inflation hitting us both hard, I need to make a move to try and reach an agreement before we both end up with nothing."
