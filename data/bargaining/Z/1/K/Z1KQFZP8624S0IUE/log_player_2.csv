**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit my desire to avoid losing everything to inflation. While the offer is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show I'm serious about my position and willing to risk it all for a fairer deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""I'm sticking to my guns, Alice.  Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm repeating my previous offer to demonstrate resolve.  Alice needs to understand I'm serious about getting a fair deal and not going to be bullied by the threat of inflation. By holding firm, I'm hoping she'll concede in the next round, especially as the shrinking pot becomes a more significant factor for both of us."
