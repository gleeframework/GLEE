"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI am offering a 60-40 split, with me (Alice) receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000. I believe this is a reasonable and fair offer, considering we are equal players in this game. I'm hoping Bob will see it the same way and we can conclude the game quickly, avoiding the negative effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the upcoming inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Given that the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round and Bob's offer gives me the smaller share, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that benefits me more. Additionally, the fact that Bob's money is only worth 5% less than in the first round gives me leverage to negotiate further, as the impact of inflation is less severe for him. I will proceed to the next round and make a new proposal.\n\n### Next Round (Round 3)\nMy new proposal will be:\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway""}\n\nI propose a 55-45 split, taking into account the impact of inflation on both of our gains. This offer is more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer but still gives Bob a significant share, considering the decreasing value of the money. I hope this offer will be more acceptable to Bob, allowing us to conclude the game before the value of the money decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Round 3
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway""}\n\nAs previously calculated, I am offering a 55-45 split, with me (Alice) receiving $550,000 and Bob receiving $450,000. This offer takes into account the impact of inflation on both of our gains and is a compromise between our previous proposals. I believe this is a reasonable offer that should be acceptable to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
