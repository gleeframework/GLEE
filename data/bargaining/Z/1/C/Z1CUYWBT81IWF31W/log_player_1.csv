"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of $500,000, and we can both finish the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiating! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 80% of the original $500,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 90% of the original $777,777.77 ($1,000,000 x 0.9).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting a 233.33% of the original amount I proposed, while I'm only getting 60% of the original amount I proposed. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly larger share than before, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up too much, you're not getting the better deal you think you are! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $100,000 is worth 10% of the original $500,000, and Bob's gain of $900,000 is worth 90% of the original $1,111,111.11 ($1,000,000 x 0.909).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as I'm getting a very small share of the original amount, and Bob is getting a significant share. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, my gain is worth 40.8% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a better deal than last time.""
}
```

This offer is a slight compromise, but I'm hoping it's more acceptable to Bob than my previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you're getting a tiny fraction, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $50,000 is worth 5% of the original $500,000, and Bob's gain of $950,000 is worth 95% of the original $1,052,632.65 ($1,000,000 x 0.4095).

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. I'm getting a tiny fraction of the original amount, and Bob is getting a significant share. I'll reject this offer.

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm hoping it's more acceptable to Bob than my previous one."
