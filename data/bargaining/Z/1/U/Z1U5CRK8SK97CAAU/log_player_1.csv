"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but still allows Bob to receive something. This is a starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a large imbalance, knowing he'll get a chance to propose in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer seems unfavorable at first glance, it's important to consider the impact of inflation. My share is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and if I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future. Bob's offer, while significantly less than my initial proposal, is still a considerable amount after accounting for inflation.  It's better to secure some gain than risk getting nothing in subsequent rounds."
