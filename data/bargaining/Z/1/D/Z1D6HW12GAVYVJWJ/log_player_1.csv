"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy.

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, a 45-55 split is a good compromise. Let's finalize the deal!""
}
```"
