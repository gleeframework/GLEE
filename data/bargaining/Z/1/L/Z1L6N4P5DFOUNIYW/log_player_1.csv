"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 70% and you can have 30%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% now, but I think I deserve more. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

My gain would be $600,000, which is 60% of the original amount. I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55% this time, but I think I'm being generous considering the inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway. It's time to make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger toll, I'm not sure if meeting halfway is the best option for me. Since the money is worth 14.26% less, I'd rather try to get more than 50% of the remaining value.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 19.63% less than the original amount, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not getting any younger. Time to make a decision, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a bit more, but I'm still holding on to a slight majority."
