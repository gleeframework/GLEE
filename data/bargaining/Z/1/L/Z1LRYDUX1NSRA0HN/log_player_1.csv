Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  This gives Bob a small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept as I'm offering a large majority of the money.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the inflation.  Let's end the game."
