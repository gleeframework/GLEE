Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the initial value of the money.""}

I propose that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation rate we're facing. Let's reach an agreement this round! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the initial value of the money. I'm willing to consider a more equal split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
