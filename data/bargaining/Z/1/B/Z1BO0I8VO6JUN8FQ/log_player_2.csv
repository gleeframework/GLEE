# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a more even split, but it's still heavily in her favor. We're only on round 5 of 12, so there's room to negotiate further. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a better deal."

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. This seems like a fair deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's time we split the money evenly.  We're both close to that point, and it's the fairest outcome. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome in this scenario. While I held out for a slightly better deal in earlier rounds, accepting an even split now ensures that we both get a substantial sum of money. It's better to agree to a fair deal than risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
