"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the first to make a proposal. This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking a slight advantage due to being the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation will hurt me more than Bob in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me a good amount of money, even with the inflation."
