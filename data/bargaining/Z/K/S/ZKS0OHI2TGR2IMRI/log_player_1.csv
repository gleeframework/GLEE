"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at the start of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to get a better deal.

I reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round, so I need to be careful.

I'll analyze Bob's offer: 480,000 is 48% of the remaining amount, which is a good deal considering the inflation. However, I think I can do better.

I reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,

# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000
