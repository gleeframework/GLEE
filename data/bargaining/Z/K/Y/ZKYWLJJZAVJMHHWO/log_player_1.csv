"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Accept and we can split the cash!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original 100$ and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous yet! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values for me are:

* My gain: 60 * 0.8 (20% less) = 48
* Bob's gain: 40 * 0.9 (10% less) = 36

I'm not impressed with the offer, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```

This time, I'm aiming for a slightly more even split, but still trying to get the better end of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I'm being fair! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values for me are:

* My gain: 50 * 0.516 (48.8% less) = 25.8
* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.727 (27.1% less) = 36.35

I think this offer is a good compromise, considering the decreasing value of money. I'll accept it.
