I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 80% of $600,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 90% of $777,777.77 ($1,000,000 * 0.9).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll have to think carefully...

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
