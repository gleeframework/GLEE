Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. My turn, and I think this is more than fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not happy with a 40% share.  I'll take my chances with inflation and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
