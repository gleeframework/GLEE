"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50-50 split, a fair and equal start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of the original $6,000, which is $4,800.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of the original $4,000, but I'll assume it is.

Considering the 50-50 split, I'll decide to reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're close, let's try 55-45""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. I'm framing it as a slight improvement on Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's try 52-48, a slightly better split for me 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,500 is now worth 44.1% of the original $6,000, which is $2,626.

I'll calculate Bob's gain: $4,500 is worth 112.5% of the original $4,000, which is $5,000. Then, with the 14.26% decrease, Bob's gain of $5,200 is 86.74% of the original $6,000, which is $4,444.4.

Considering the 52-48 split, I'll decide to reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 52-48 in my favor, with me getting $5,200 and Bob getting $4,800. I'm framing it as a compromise, trying to meet Bob halfway."
