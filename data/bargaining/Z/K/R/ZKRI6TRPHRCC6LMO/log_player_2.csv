Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get worried. We're running out of time. This is my best offer. Let's come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is showing signs of worry, indicating we might be able to push for a better deal. While her offer is somewhat better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  We're getting into the later rounds, so increasing the pressure with strategic rejections might work in our favor."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This offer is a fair compromise. We're getting close to the wire, let's seal the deal.""

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to the deadline.  Let's split this evenly and call it a day. It's the only way we both get anything. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  A 50/50 split is a fair deal, and Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the deadline. Accepting now guarantees we both get something substantial instead of risking walking away with nothing if we push further and run out of rounds."
