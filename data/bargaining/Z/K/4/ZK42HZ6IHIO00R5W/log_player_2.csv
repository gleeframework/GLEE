"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we take the larger share upfront, given the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what I can get with my own offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more equitable split, considering the inflation factor. Let's work together to get the most out of this deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is working against you. I'm offering a reasonable deal, but my patience is not unlimited. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is getting to me. Accepting this offer will at least ensure some profit."
