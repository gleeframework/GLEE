600000.0,400000.0,Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I think I deserve a bit more since I made the first offer.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,Your split isn't considering the inflation. I propose a more realistic 55-45 split in my favor.,Bob,2,

580000.0,420000.0,"Considering the inflation, I'll make a slight adjustment, but I still think I deserve a bigger share since you also lose value with each round. Let's do 58-42.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. This deal accounts for the inflation, giving me a slight edge due to the faster devaluation on your end. Let's close this deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"We're indeed running out of time. Given the rapid devaluation on my end, I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I should get the larger share. Let's meet in the middle, 56-44.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
490000.0,510000.0,"Alice, this is a very reasonable offer.  I'm taking a smaller percentage than my last, acknowledging the need to make a deal. This is as far as I'm willing to go.",Bob,6,
