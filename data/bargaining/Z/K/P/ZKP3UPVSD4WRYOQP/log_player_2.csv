Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll make a slight adjustment, but I still think I deserve a bigger share since you also lose value with each round. Let's do 58-42. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still trying to take a significantly larger share, even though she's more affected by inflation. While my potential gains are shrinking, I need to hold out for a more equitable deal.  Alice's offer is barely different from her first, and I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This deal accounts for the inflation, giving me a slight edge due to the faster devaluation on your end. Let's close this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're in round 4 of 12. I need to start pushing for a deal that favors me before the inflation eats away too much of my potential gain.
* **Inflation Factor:** Highlighting that her share is devaluing faster puts pressure on Alice to agree. 
* **Appearance of Compromise:** While this offer still favors me, it's a significant shift from my previous 55-45 proposal, making it seem like I'm compromising."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're indeed running out of time. Given the rapid devaluation on my end, I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I should get the larger share. Let's meet in the middle, 56-44. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the time pressure and the impact of inflation, but her offer is still not reflective of the situation. She's only moved 2% from her original 60-40 split, while the actual value of her share has dropped significantly. I need to hold firm and push for a more favorable split, as accepting this offer would still leave me with a much smaller portion of the initial value."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a very reasonable offer.  I'm taking a smaller percentage than my last, acknowledging the need to make a deal. This is as far as I'm willing to go.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my ask slightly to show flexibility, but holding a firm line to signal this is my final offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  We are past the halfway point, and the pressure is on both of us to avoid a stalemate.
* **Framing:**  By presenting this as my final offer, I'm aiming to get Alice to accept rather than risk further devaluation with a counter-offer."
