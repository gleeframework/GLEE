"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. This is a fair starting point, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to negotiate or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, the offer from Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not going low enough!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and encouraging him to go even lower. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm making a new offer with a 45-55 split, trying to find a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob."
