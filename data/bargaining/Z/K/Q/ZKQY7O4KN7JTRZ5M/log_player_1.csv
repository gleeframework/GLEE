"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the first to offer a split. This is a fair starting point, given the inflation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 70%, but I'm still offering Bob a significant portion. This is a fair compromise given the inflation factor and the fact that I'm the one making the offer this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. While the inflation is a factor, I believe I can secure a more favorable split in the upcoming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With inflation continuing to bite, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable solution, given the significant value loss we've both experienced.  It's time to compromise to ensure we both get something."
