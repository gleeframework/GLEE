"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100 dollars, which is a relatively small amount to see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking its toll, the value of the money has decreased. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 70 is a good deal, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small amount, but I need to get a better share to compensate for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping that the reduced value of the money will make it more palatable for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet. I think we can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a significant toll, the value of the money has decreased substantially. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 75 is a good deal, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better offer, but I'm starting to think that Bob is being more aggressive in his offers, trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll have to be more careful in my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing rapidly, I'll have to be more cautious and think strategically. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a very small share, but I need to secure a decent amount for myself to make this deal worthwhile.""
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering Bob an extremely small share, but I'm hoping that he'll be desperate enough to accept it, given the low value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get desperate, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I think we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a significant toll, the value of the money has decreased substantially. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, as the value of the money is so low that I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. I'll take 65 and hope that it's enough to make the deal worthwhile."
