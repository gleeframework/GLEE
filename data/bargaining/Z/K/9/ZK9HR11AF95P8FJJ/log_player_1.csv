```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more for myself to make this worthwhile.""
}

Round 4

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the inflation, my money is worth less and less, so I'll try to get a larger share now. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, I need a bigger share to keep up with the cost of living.""
}
```"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you'll have to make a better offer if you want me to give up more 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation more and more, and I need to make a decision. Given that my money is worth significantly less now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make the most of what's left. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm reverting back to the original 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting it now that the money is worth less."
