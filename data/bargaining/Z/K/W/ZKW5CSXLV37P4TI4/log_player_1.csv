Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think 60/40 is a more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
