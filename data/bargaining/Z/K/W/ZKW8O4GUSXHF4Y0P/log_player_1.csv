# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, since the money is worth the same to me. You should be willing to compromise more, since the money is losing value for you. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best outcome for me. If I reject, I risk getting nothing in the next round."
