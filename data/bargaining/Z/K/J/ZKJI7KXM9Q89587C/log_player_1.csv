Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll take the lion's share, but give Bob a small amount to make it seem fair. Let's see if he accepts in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take half now than risk getting less later due to inflation."
