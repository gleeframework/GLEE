"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I need to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject the offer since it's not in my favor. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the devaluation.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
