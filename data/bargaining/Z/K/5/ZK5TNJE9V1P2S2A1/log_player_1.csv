"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about giving up more than I initially proposed. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
