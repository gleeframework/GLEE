Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money devalues faster for her.  While her offer is closer to the middle, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid devaluation she faces.  I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  The devaluation is significant, let's be realistic and close this deal.""}"
