**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage:

* **Inflation Impact:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly.  Waiting any longer risks getting a worse offer later that will be worth even less due to inflation.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently aimed for a larger share. It's unlikely he will drastically change his position in the remaining rounds.
* **Certainty:** Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable share, whereas continuing carries the risk of ending up with nothing if an agreement isn't reached."
