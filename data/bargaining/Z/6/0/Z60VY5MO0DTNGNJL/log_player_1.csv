"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly, this time I'll take a bit more since I'm proposing.  Let's end this round and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 45 is actually worth 95% of the original 60, which is 57. 

I don't think this offer is more even than my original proposal, so I'll reject it. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is now worth 90% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 54,
  ""bob_gain"": 46,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 54% of the current value of the money, and Bob will get 46%."
