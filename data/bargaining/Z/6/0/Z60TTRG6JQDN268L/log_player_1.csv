"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 45-55 split is fair, especially since the money is worth less for me. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a middle ground that Bob will accept."
