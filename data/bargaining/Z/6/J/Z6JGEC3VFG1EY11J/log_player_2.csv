"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I take the lion's share, but you get a decent start.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to get something, Bob should reject this offer. It's a good opportunity to see if Alice will be more generous in the next round, and with each round, Bob's position gets better due to the more significant inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
