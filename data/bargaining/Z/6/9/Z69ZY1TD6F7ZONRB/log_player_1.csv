"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly to avoid inflation loss""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. This seems like a reasonable starting point, considering I'm the one who will be losing value due to inflation if we don't come to an agreement quickly. I've attached a message to Bob, suggesting that we split fairly to avoid losing value due to inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more than your initial offer, but I need a bigger share to compensate for the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle to minimize inflation loss""
}
```

I've reduced my initial offer slightly, taking into account the 5% loss due to inflation in the previous rounds. I'm now offering to take 57% of the money, leaving 43% for Bob. I've attached a message to Bob, suggesting that we meet in the middle to minimize the loss due to inflation. Hopefully, Bob will see the sense in this and we can come to an agreement!"
