Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, reconsider? 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against Bob. While the offers are getting closer to an even split, Bob should still hold out a little longer.  There's a good chance Alice will get more anxious as the rounds progress and the risk of both getting nothing increases."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is running out, this is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We need to start getting more agreeable to avoid disaster. This offer is still slightly in Alice's favor, but the firm ""final offer"" message might push her to accept. It's a risky move, as future rounds will hurt Bob more, but it might be enough to get Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance before I take more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Alice is playing hardball. Let's analyze:

* **The Offer:** 4200 for Bob, 5800 for Alice.  Heavily favors Alice.
* **Inflation:** The value for Bob is dropping drastically. This offer is worth much less than it appears.
* **Alice's Tone:**  ""Last chance..."" implies she'll become even MORE demanding if Bob rejects.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  Only 3 rounds left after this. The risk of getting $0 is very high now.

**Decision:** This is a gamble, but I think Bob has to **{""decision"": ""reject""}**.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Calling the Bluff:** Alice might be bluffing about taking even more. She knows the clock is ticking for Bob.  If she's bluffing, she might be more reasonable in Round 10.

2. **Slight Chance of a Better Deal:** While unlikely, there's a tiny chance Alice panics as the deadline nears and makes a last-minute better offer.

3. **Principle:** Accepting now would mean Alice gets her way entirely due to Bob's disadvantage. There's a psychological element to holding on a little longer, even if the odds are bad.

**Important Note:**  This is a very high-risk rejection. If Alice isn't bluffing, Bob is in for a worse deal or even $0."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""This is the best I can do. Let's end this before it's too late.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's officially panic time.  We have to make a serious move to avoid total loss. 

* **Conceding to Reality:**  Alice is clearly the dominant player due to the inflation setup.  Trying to get anything close to an even split is unrealistic at this point.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  Holding out further has a very small chance of a slightly better deal, but a much larger chance of complete failure.  This offer cuts Bob's losses.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the danger they both face. Alice might be more receptive if she sees Bob is finally being realistic about the situation.

This is a last-ditch effort to salvage something. The odds aren't good, but it's the most logical play given the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Back to my original offer, it's only fair now 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is in a terrible position, but he has to {""decision"": ""reject""} one last time.

Here's why:

* **Alice is Exploiting the Situation:** She knows Bob is desperate. Going back to her original, heavily skewed offer proves she's just trying to maximize her gain, fairness be damned.
* **One Tiny Chance:** There's a minuscule possibility that Alice, in a moment of panic or overconfidence, offers something slightly better in the very last round. The odds are astronomically low, but it's still *slightly* better than accepting this awful deal.
* **Pride (Maybe?):** At this point, it's about more than the money. Accepting means letting Alice win entirely due to the unfair advantage. Rejecting, even if it means $0, is a final act of defiance.

It's 99.9% certain Bob will get nothing, but there's that 0.1% where Alice slips up.  It's a long shot, but it's the only play left."

Round 12
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""You win, Alice. Take it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is it, the final stand. And it's a complete and utter surrender.

* **No Leverage:** Bob has none. Inflation has eaten away at his potential gains, and time has run out. 
* **Alice Knows She's Won:** Her going back to the original offer proves she'll squeeze every last drop. She has no incentive to offer anything better.
* **Better Something Than Nothing:** Rejecting means BOTH get $0. There's no heroic last stand here, just the cold reality that Bob needs to salvage something.

This isn't a negotiation anymore; it's damage control. This message is as much about preserving a sliver of dignity as it is about the money. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but it's the only one left."
