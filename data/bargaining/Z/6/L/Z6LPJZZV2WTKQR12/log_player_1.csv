"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of the original amount, so I'll be getting $70 * 0.95 = $66.50.

As for Bob's offer, he's proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even split than my original offer. I'm inclined to accept this offer.
