"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was unfair. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""The money is losing value for you, Bob. I'm offering a little more than last round. Let's close this deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
 
Although not ideal, Bob's offer in round 4 is better than what I might get in further rounds as the value decreases for him and my bargaining power diminishes.  Accepting ensures I get a reasonable amount."
