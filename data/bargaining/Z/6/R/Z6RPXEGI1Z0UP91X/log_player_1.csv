"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose keeping 90 dollars for myself, and giving Bob 10 dollars.  This is a fair offer, as I am taking a slight risk by going first. However, I think it's important to establish early on that I am willing to take a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Although my share is lower, it's still worth more than if we went another round and I had to make a proposal.  The risk of continued inflation is too high."
