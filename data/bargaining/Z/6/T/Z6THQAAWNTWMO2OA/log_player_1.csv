"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20 to get started""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's start with a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to play it safe and fair. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, giving me $7,000 and Bob $3,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit greedy, let's try to find a compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob thinks I'm being too greedy! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up that much more to Bob, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20.41% less due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal:

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to try to meet in the middle again. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split, considering the inflation factor. I'd rather not risk going to another round and potentially getting a worse deal. Let's finalize the split!"
