"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me a smaller share than I initially proposed. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2. Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to compensate for the lost value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You took a bigger share last round, now it's my turn to push back. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to regain some ground and take a slightly larger share, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a significant toll on my potential earnings. Considering the offers so far, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise. I'd rather accept this offer and get a slightly larger share than risk rejecting it and facing further erosion of the total value.
