Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  A fair deal saves us both time and money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to try and negotiate for more, but with inflation eating away at the value, a 50/50 split is fair and ensures we don't lose more money in future rounds."
