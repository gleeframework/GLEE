"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I think I can do better than 40% in the long run, especially since the money is losing value faster for Alice.  Let's see if I can get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's split the money 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time.  We can work towards a fairer split later on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's try 57-43. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I want, and with inflation hitting us both, it's better to take what I can get now."
