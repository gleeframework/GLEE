"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid too many rounds of inflation. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 60/40 split isn't fair enough for me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation risk I'm taking.""}\n\n###\nI'm making a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation risk I'm taking by not accepting Alice's initial offer. A 55/45 split is more favorable to me, but still gives Alice a significant share. The message aims to persuade Alice that this is a reasonable compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is hitting you harder than me. Let's settle this now. I'm slightly lowering my ask to 58/42. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. The difference in inflation impact between us gives me leverage to push for a more favorable split, as Alice is more motivated to end the game sooner to minimize her own losses. I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get closer to my target."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5700, ""alice_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""I understand the pressure of inflation, but I've taken a bigger hit. I'm willing to settle at 57/43, considering the current value loss. Let's end this before it gets worse.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer, taking into account the increasing pressure of inflation on both of us, but highlighting that I've been hit harder. By suggesting a 57/43 split, I'm trying to find a middle ground that acknowledges Alice's eagerness to settle while still pushing for a better deal for myself. The message aims to convey a sense of urgency and shared risk, encouraging Alice to accept this offer before the value of the money drops further."
