Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer was more than fair. Let's be realistic, inflation is working against you. I'm willing to compromise, but this is my bottom line.

# Alice gain: 800000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or we both risk walking away with nothing. Inflation is not your friend here. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the situation is getting tighter, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss compared to what I could have gained earlier.  I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to try and secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Every round that passes hurts us both, even if it hurts me more.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball and appeal to Alice's self-interest. A 50/50 split might seem like I'm conceding a lot considering the inflation, but:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and Alice knows that continued stalling increases the risk of a zero-sum outcome. 
* **Fairness:**  Even with inflation, a 50/50 split is objectively fair. It removes any argument of greed from my side.
* **Inflation Reminder:**  While the message emphasizes fairness, it subtly reminds Alice that every wasted round is a loss for both of us, even if it impacts me more."
