Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts Bob is offering:

$6,000 in round 1 is worth 80% of its original value due to 20% inflation, which is $4,800.
$4,800 is worth 48.8% of its original value due to additional 28.8% inflation, which is approximately $2,349.60.

So, Bob's offer is actually:
$2,349.60 for me and $2,650.40 for him.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
