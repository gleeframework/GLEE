"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 90% for me and 10% for you. It's a good start, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a bad deal for Bob, but it's important to see what Alice's next offer is.  With each round, the potential gains for Bob increase significantly due to inflation, so he needs to consider that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's be reasonable and end this game now.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a compromise.  I'll take 65% and you can have 35%. This is a fair offer considering the inflation and my previous rejection of your proposal. I'm willing to move closer to your original offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should reject this offer.  While the offer is better than the initial one, the inflation factor is significant enough that Bob can likely get a better deal if he waits.  His gains are dropping rapidly with each round, and Alice's gains are dropping much slower. There's still a good chance he can get a better offer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
