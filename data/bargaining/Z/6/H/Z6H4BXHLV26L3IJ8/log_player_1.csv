Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nHow's that? I offered Bob 40% of the total amount, which I think is a generous offer considering we're just starting out. I also added a friendly message to set a positive tone for our negotiation. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This offer considers the time pressure we're both under. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it. Although the money is worth 10% less now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to decrease my initial offer slightly, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob was willing to offer me 4500 in the previous round. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is ticking - this offer is fair and lets us both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer again. Although the money is worth 27.1% less now, I still think I can get a better deal. Bob's offer is slightly better than the previous one, but I'm not convinced it's the best we can do. Let's keep negotiating!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting us both - let's compromise""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to decrease my offer again, considering the increasing inflation. I'm trying to find a compromise that we can both agree on, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer before the value of the money drops even further. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's end this. 50/50 is the fairest and ensures we both get something before inflation makes this pointless. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer this time. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (40.95% less than the initial amount), I think a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable compromise. It's better to get something now rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds. Let's end this game on a mutually beneficial note!"
