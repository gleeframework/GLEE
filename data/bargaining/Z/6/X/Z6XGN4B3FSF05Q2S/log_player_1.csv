"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the 100$ and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's see if we can agree! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of 45$ is actually worth 45 * 0.9 = 40.5$.

I think a 55/45 split is a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, considering the initial proposal was 60/40. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my previous gain of 60$ is now worth 60 * 0.9^2 = 51$.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and tries to balance the split:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, we can still negotiate from here""
}
```"
