Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth less for me, but Bob's offer is the same as my original offer in the first round. I'll decide to reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate for the reduced value. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
