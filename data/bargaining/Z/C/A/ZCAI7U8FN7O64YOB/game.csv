9000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can adjust if you want.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I think a 60/40 split is more fair. We can both get more this way as the money inflates for me.  Let's work together to make sure we both get something good.,Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm still thinking we can both do better.  I'm willing to compromise, and I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a good starting point. This gives me a bit more to account for the inflation, and ensures that we both walk away with a reasonable amount. Let's talk!",Alice,3,

3000.0,7000.0,"I'm willing to go up to 7000 for myself, but I think we need to be realistic.  The money is inflating for me, so I can't afford to go much higher.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",Bob,4,
