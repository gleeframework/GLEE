Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm still thinking we can both do better.  I'm willing to compromise, and I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a good starting point. This gives me a bit more to account for the inflation, and ensures that we both walk away with a reasonable amount. Let's talk! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
