Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it from that perspective. If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. That's not a bad deal, but I was hoping for a more even split.
