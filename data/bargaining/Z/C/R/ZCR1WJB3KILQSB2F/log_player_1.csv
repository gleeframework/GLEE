"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time to make a new proposal!

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This time, I'm offering a slightly more generous split in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a decent share."
