"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me only 1000 dollars! I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I'm going to offer Alice 1000 dollars and keep 9000 for myself. I'm hoping she'll accept, since she rejected my previous offer, and I'm not sure if she knows about the inflation effect yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like more, the inflation effect is starting to kick in, and this offer is better than what I got last round.  I'll accept."
