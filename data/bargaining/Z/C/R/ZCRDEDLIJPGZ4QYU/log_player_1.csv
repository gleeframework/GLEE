I'm offering Bob $1,000, keeping $9,000 for myself. I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,800, which is more than he offered me in the last round. This is a calculated risk, considering the inflation. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer before the inflation significantly impacts my gains further."
