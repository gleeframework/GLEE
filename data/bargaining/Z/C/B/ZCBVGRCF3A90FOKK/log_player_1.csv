"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer because I'm not getting a good deal. I'd rather try to negotiate for more.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer for round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm aiming for a higher share this time, taking into account the reduced value of money due to inflation."
