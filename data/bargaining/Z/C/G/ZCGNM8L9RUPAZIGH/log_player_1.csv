Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering you a fair deal. We both know the clock is ticking, especially for you. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using a classic negotiation tactic, emphasizing time pressure while slowly increasing his offer.  He knows the longer the game goes, the more desperate I become. However, his offer is still significantly in his favor. It's better to make a counter offer and demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate but won't be bullied into a bad deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution.  Agree now, and we both walk away with something substantial.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to go on the offensive and propose a 50/50 split.  This emphasizes fairness and simplifies the negotiation. By this point, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to accept an offer heavily skewed in my favor, even with the time pressure.  A 50/50 split is a strong stance to take and might make him reconsider his negotiating position."
