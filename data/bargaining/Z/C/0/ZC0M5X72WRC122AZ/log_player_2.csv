"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and will allow us both to benefit from the game. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The current offer gives Alice a larger share, and I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing money because of inflation.  My offer is still better for both of us in the long run. Let's be reasonable and close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice's message emphasizes the impact of inflation, her offer still gives her a larger share. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can negotiate a better deal. The difference in inflation rates between us might give me an advantage in the long run, so I'll hold out for now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. Considering the impact of inflation, I'll try to find a balance that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Inflation is affecting us both, but at different rates. I'm willing to find a compromise that acknowledges this difference. Let's settle on this split and minimize our losses.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this back and forth is only hurting us. I'm compromising again to try and settle this. This offer is the best you'll get considering how much we lose each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Alice, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise. Further negotiations might lead to even greater losses, so I'll settle for this split to ensure we both get something out of the game."
