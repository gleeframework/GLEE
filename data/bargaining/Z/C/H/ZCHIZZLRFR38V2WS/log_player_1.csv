Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 20% share, which is still a generous offer considering the game is just starting."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, so I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.
