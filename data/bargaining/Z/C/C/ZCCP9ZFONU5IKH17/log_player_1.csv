I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping to secure a good share early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something, I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion, especially with inflation in play. It's my turn to make a proposal, and I will try to find a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a split of 81/19 in my favor. While I still aim for a significant share, I've lowered my demand slightly, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer. This should hopefully be a more appealing proposition for both of us."
