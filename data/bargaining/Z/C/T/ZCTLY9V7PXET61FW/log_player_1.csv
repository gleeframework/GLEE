"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original amount, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $600,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering the work I'll do to divide the money. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's doing all the work, huh?

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal, and I think I can do better than 35% of the remaining amount. Let's see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw! 50-50 split, no hard feelings!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about a 60-40 split in my favor?  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to get a bigger share, huh?

I'm not convinced that a 60-40 split is fair, especially since the money is worth less to Bob than to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll stick to my guns and see if Bob can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 55-45 split, that's my final offer!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I'm not giving away too much, but also not getting left with too little. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
