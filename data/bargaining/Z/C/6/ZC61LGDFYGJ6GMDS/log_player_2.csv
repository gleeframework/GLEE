"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but I'll be generous and give you a small amount. This way, we can get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 10,000 dollars is a good amount, there's no incentive to accept in the first round. By rejecting, I can make the proposal in the next round and potentially secure a much larger share.  The inflation factor also makes waiting more appealing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""I think a more equitable split is in order. Let's agree on this, and we can both walk away happy.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share. This offer is fair, considering the inflation. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  Inflation is a significant factor, and if I reject, there's no guarantee that Alice will offer me anything in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial amount, even after inflation."
