"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. I've included a message to Bob, suggesting that this division is fair. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This is more equitable considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the effects of inflation, I'll weigh the pros and cons of accepting Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer gives me $40, I'll calculate the actual value of this amount. On the other hand, Bob's gain is worth 5% less, but he's offering himself $60, which might still be advantageous for him.\n\nGiven these factors, I'll decide whether to accept Bob's offer or proceed to the next round, where I'll make a new proposal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Now it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the current state of inflation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more fair""}\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to my new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nAs we enter Round 3, I'll reassess the situation considering the inflation. The money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original amount (10% decrease from Round 1 to Round 2, and another 10% decrease from Round 2 to Round 3), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than the original amount (5% decrease from Round 1 to Round 2, and another 5% decrease from Round 2 to Round 3).\n\nGiven these factors, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the current state of inflation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, 50/50 is the fairest split now""}\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to my new offer."
