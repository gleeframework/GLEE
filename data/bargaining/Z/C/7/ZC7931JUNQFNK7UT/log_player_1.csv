I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly and avoid the inflation affecting my share.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, this offer is still a significant gain for me, and the risk of continued inflation makes it unwise to hold out for more.  I'll accept and secure my half of the money!"
