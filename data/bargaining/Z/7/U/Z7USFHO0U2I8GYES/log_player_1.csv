"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal that splits the money fairly. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to make up for it. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting my next offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
