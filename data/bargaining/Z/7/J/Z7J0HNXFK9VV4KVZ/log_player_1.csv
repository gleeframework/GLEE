Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. We both get a good amount, and it avoids any further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'm willing to take that risk to try to get a larger share. Let's see what happens next!"
