"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% and Bob getting 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight improvement, but I'm holding out for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $8000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $7200. Bob's share of $2000 remains the same.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 2:3 split, especially considering the inflation effect on my share. I'll make a new offer in Round 3."
