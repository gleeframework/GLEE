"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would get are:

* My gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48

I'd rather not accept this offer, as I'd be getting less than I initially proposed in Round 1. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money decreases further."
