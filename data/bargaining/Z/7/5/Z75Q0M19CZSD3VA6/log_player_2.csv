Alice's offer:

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I know there's potential for me to get a better deal, especially since we're playing with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
This is a good deal for me. Even with the inflation, getting 50% is better than risking getting less in the next round. I'd rather take this than risk getting nothing in the final rounds."
