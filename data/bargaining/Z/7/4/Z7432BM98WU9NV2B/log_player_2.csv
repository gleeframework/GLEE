"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide the money in a way that benefits both of us. Since I'm starting, I'll take a bit more, but you'll still get a significant amount. Plus, think about the inflation - every round we delay, our money loses value! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly, it's the fairest solution and we both get the maximum amount possible before inflation hits.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're looking for a fair split, but considering I started with a higher offer and you rejected, I'll meet you halfway between my original and your offer. We're both losing value each round, let's not drag this out! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
