"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money equally. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $450,000 in terms of its purchasing power.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a reasonable offer, and splitting the money equally is a fair way to go. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
