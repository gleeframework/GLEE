"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split 60/40. It's a fair deal for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation won't hurt me as much as the 10% will hurt Alice. Maybe I can get a better deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 45/55 is more reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation. How about a 50/50 split to end this fairly? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, a 50/50 split seems fair at this point. The money's value is decreasing, and Alice is losing more value than I am. I don't want to risk going into another round where the value could decrease even further. It's better to secure the 50% now."
