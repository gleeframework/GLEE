"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose a 99/1 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less to me with each passing round, I want to maximize my share now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, with the 20% devaluation, accepting a 50/50 split is the best I can do."
