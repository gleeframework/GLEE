"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 2:1 ratio is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. This way, we both get a decent share of the money.
