"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and I think it gives Bob a good incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is tempting, it's important to remember that I'm losing out on a significant amount of money due to inflation. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good way to avoid the further inflation and potential for a worse outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though it's not the ideal split, I'm accepting Bob's offer. The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money, and I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round."
