"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  This offer gives me a significant advantage, but it's still better for you to take it now than to risk losing more value in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While this offer is tempting, it's in my best interest to see if I can get a better deal in the future rounds.  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's split the difference.  I'm willing to give you a good share, but I need a more equitable split to make it worthwhile for me.  This offer is fair and allows us both to walk away with a sizable amount.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the value is decreasing for both of us. I'm offering you a quarter of the total amount. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. Take it before it depreciates further. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is better than my previous rejection, I'm still hopeful of getting a better deal. I have 9 more rounds, and the value continues to decrease for me. I'll see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 300000, ""alice_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping for a more equitable split.  I understand the pressure of the decreasing value, but  I believe we can find a solution that benefits both of us.  This offer is a step towards that. Let's work together.""}
