"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get the remaining 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a lot better to try and negotiate a better deal, especially since the value of the money will decrease with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be more reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split.  This is a fairer division that allows us both to get a significant amount.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a more even split, but considering the inflation, I believe a 60/40 split is a fair compromise.  Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
The inflation is hitting hard, and getting a 40% share is still a good outcome.  It's time to end this game."
