"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later if needed. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's early in the game, and since inflation is a factor, I want to see if I can get a slightly better deal. I'll try to propose something more favorable to myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the potential impact of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60% is a bit too high for me. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor this time, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better split, I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent sum, and it's likely that further rounds will only reduce my gains further."
