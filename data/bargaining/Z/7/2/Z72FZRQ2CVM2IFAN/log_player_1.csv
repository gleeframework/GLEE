"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the potential impact of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll need to consider the value of the money more carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60% is a bit too high for me. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor this time, but I'm open to negotiations.""
}
```

I'm trying to counter Bob's previous offer by proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm still open to further negotiations."
