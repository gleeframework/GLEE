Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. You still get a decent amount, and it's more than what you offered me last round. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100
