Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see what you did there, Bob! Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about a 55-45 split? It's a fair compromise, if I do say so myself. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems closer to ""fair"" in principle, she's still benefiting significantly more from the inflation. I need to push for a larger share while it's still somewhat worthwhile."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Alice, and we're both losing it! I'll take 58% - it's a good deal considering the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. I'm increasing my demand to 58% to account for the rapid devaluation and to incentivize Alice to settle now before it gets even worse for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're both losing value, but I'm losing it faster! Let's try to find a middle ground. I'll take 52%, and we can call it a day. It's better than letting the inflation monster eat away our money. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is working against me more than Alice. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting 48% now is better than risking another rejection and getting an even smaller amount in a future round."
