"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a somewhat aggressive offer.  I want to secure a large portion of the money while leaving Bob with a small amount.  I'm assuming he might accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is far too unfavorable, especially considering the inflation.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still trying to secure a majority of the money.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm assuming he's more willing to negotiate now. I'll try to strike a balance between securing a good deal and avoiding another rejection."
