"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject this offer. 

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I'll aim for a better split.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 45-55""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to be even more cautious with this offer. However, I'm not thrilled about the 20-80 split.

I'll decide to reject this offer.
