I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving you $6,000 and Bob $4,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the 50/50 split now.  While I'd prefer more, the inflation rate is going to eat away at my potential gains quickly.  Accepting this offer means I'm guaranteed half the money."
