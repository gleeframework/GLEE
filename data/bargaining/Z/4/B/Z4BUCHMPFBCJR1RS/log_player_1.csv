"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping to get a quick resolution and minimize the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I propose an 81/19 split in my favor. Bob's offer in the previous round was extremely unfavorable, and while I acknowledge the impact of inflation, I believe this offer is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still extremely unfavorable, and while I acknowledge the impact of inflation, it doesn't justify accepting a deal where I receive only 20% of the remaining value. I believe a more balanced offer is possible."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I propose an 72.9/27.1 split in my favor. I understand that inflation is impacting us both, but I believe this offer is a fair reflection of the value remaining and offers a reasonable outcome for both parties."
