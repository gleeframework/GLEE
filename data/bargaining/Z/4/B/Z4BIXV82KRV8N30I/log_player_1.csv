"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I'm taking a very large share initially, as the risk is on Bob.  If he rejects, we'll go to another round where I get to propose again. I'm hoping he'll take the small amount to avoid risking getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer, and I'd rather get $50 than risk getting nothing in the next rounds."
