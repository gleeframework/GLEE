"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share, but I'll still give you a decent chunk.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
