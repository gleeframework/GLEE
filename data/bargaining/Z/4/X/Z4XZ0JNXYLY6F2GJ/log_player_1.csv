Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity in the first round, but I believe a more even split is fairer. I'm offering you 100,000, which is a significant portion of the money, considering the inflation factor. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
