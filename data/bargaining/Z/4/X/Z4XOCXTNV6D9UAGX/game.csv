900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can adjust things later if you're not happy with that.,Alice,1,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Considering the inflation, accepting now is in your best interest for a good deal.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I see you're getting greedy. I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split in my favor is the best I can offer.  Remember, every round we delay hurts you more than me with inflation.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. A 55/45 split in my favor is more than fair considering the significant inflation we're facing. If you decline, I'm willing to gamble on a later round, even with the losses.",Bob,4,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, it seems we're both stubborn. Let's split the money evenly this time. It's the fairest option given the circumstances, and we can both walk away with something.  I'm not sure how much longer we can keep playing this game without both of us losing out.",Alice,5,
