{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. I propose a 55/45 split, which is still generous considering the inflation.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round. My 60/40 split was fair, yours wasn't. I'm willing to compromise slightly at 58/42, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
