I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a good starting point, as it gives Bob something to consider while still being a very favorable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 80/20, but I'm still confident that this is a good deal for me. Bob is likely to accept this offer, given that he rejected my previous offer and now faces the risk of inflation."
