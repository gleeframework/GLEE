"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively generous amount considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a higher amount this time, but you have to meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $36 in the original terms.

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I'd like to get a bit more than 40. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not meeting you in the middle, I want a bit more""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make an offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in Round 2, so it's equivalent to 90% of $40, which is $36.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you a bit more in the middle, but I'm still looking for a better deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $55, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time to meet in the middle, let's call it a draw 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of my gain in the first round. My gain in Round 4 is worth 27.1% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to 0.271 * $40 = $10.84.

Considering the offer from Bob, I'd be getting $50, which is equivalent to 50 / 0.488 = $102.47 in the original terms. That's a very generous offer!

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I'm getting a good deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""You're right, let's call it a draw""
}
