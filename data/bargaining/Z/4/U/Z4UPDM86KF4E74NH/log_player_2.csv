"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round, considering the inflation. Even though the offer is fair, I'll try to get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's time to switch the roles, and I'd like to propose a more even split, considering inflation will affect the value in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if you can meet me in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like to get more, the inflation is starting to significantly affect the value of the money. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's a good compromise considering the previous rounds."
