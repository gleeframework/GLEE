"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time to switch the roles, and I'd like to propose a more even split, considering inflation will affect the value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my thinking to account for the inflation.

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to take a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give up that much more than before, considering the inflation. Let's see if we can do better.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting my gains more severely, I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if you can meet me in the middle.""
}
```"
