"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not going to get any lower!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping it'll put some pressure on Bob to accept the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split since we're both entitled to half. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","An equal split, huh? That's a fair offer, but I'm not sure I want to give up that extra $200,000. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I want more, let's keep negotiating!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was an equal split, I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, I'm in control now!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. Let's see if Bob will back down!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I suggest a 55/45 split, which is fair considering the previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 55/45 split in Bob's favor, huh? That's a bit more in his direction than I'm comfortable with. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much, let's keep going!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take a more conciliatory approach this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split, which is a bit closer to an equal split than my previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
