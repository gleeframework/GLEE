"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. It's a fair deal for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal.  I have time to think about it since the money is losing value faster for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the money is losing value faster for you. Let's end this game.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the situation, but your offer was too low. Let's settle this with 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's not ideal, I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation. Accepting this offer is the best way to minimize the losses for me."
