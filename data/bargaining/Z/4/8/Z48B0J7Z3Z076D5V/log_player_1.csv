I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor. It's a generous offer, considering the inflation will benefit Bob in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering 8000 for myself and 2000 for Bob.  While the inflation hurts, I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob to accept before things get worse for him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I'm getting, it's better to take something than nothing.  It's likely Bob will offer me even less in the next round."
