"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, so I'm proposing a 52-48 split.  Let's settle this quickly before inflation eats into our gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation hurts me. I need to push for a more significant concession in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is hurting us both. I'm proposing a 55-45 split. This is a fair deal that lets us both walk away with a significant sum.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make a small concession, but I still believe I deserve the larger share. Inflation is hurting you more than me, so let's settle this soon. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is right, time is running out, and inflation is a significant factor now. However, her concession is too small. I need to hold firm and push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 470000, ""alice_gain"": 530000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to be realistic. Inflation is eating away at this deal with every passing round.  A 53-47 split is fair and lets us both leave with something substantial.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious about inflation, but I'm not budging much. This is my most generous offer yet, take it before things get worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The pressure is on.  While this offer is still far from ideal, it's the best one I'm likely to get.  Continuing to hold out risks getting a worse deal or even nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
