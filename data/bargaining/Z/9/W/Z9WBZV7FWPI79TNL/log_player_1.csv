"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 4:1 in your favor. This allows us both to benefit while accounting for the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the value of the money decreases more for you in subsequent rounds. This allows for a more even distribution of the remaining value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
