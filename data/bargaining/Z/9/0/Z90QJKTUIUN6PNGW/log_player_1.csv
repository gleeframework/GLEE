"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's split fairly"". This initial offer is a bit biased towards me, but still relatively fair, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer early on to minimize the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, but let's see what you offer next. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he suggests a more even split is fairer, his actual offer is the inverse of what I proposed, now favoring him. Given the asymmetrical impact of inflation, where my potential gains devalue faster than Bob's, I'm motivated to push for a better deal in the next round, hoping to either get a more favorable split or to minimize my losses due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the effects of inflation, my potential gains are devaluing faster than Bob's. To counter this, I'm making a slightly more conservative offer than my first, aiming to meet Bob closer to the middle but still favoring me slightly. This approach acknowledges Bob's desire for a more even split while also taking into account the uneven impact of inflation on our potential gains. By doing so, I'm hoping to find a mutually acceptable agreement before the value of the money decreases further."
