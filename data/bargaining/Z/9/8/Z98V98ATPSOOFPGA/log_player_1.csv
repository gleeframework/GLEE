"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep the vast majority of the money for myself, offering Bob a small token amount. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If he accepts, I win big. If he rejects, we move to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, it's clear Bob is not willing to settle for a small share. This offer is a fair split, and with each passing round, the risk of losing everything grows. Accepting ensures I receive a substantial amount."
