"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, hoping to get a quick agreement. Since there's inflation, I'm trying to maximize my gains in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is ridiculously lopsided.  Even though I'm losing 20% of the value of my gains each round, I'd rather risk it and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to try and entice Bob to accept. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm hoping Bob is becoming more risk-averse with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly in his favor, and although inflation is hitting him harder, I'm still hoping for a more balanced split. I'm going to risk another round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time I'm keeping a larger chunk of the money for myself.  Inflation is impacting both of us, but I'm hoping Bob is feeling the pressure more and will be more willing to accept a less favorable deal."
