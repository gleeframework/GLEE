"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm not ready to accept a 60-40 split just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept a 65-35 split, especially considering the money is worth less for both of us. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth even less now!

{
  ""alice_gain"": 42.5,
