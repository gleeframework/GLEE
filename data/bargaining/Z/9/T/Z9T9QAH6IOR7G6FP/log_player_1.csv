"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which seems like a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 7000 is now worth 70% of the initial 10,000, which is 7000. Since Bob's gain of 3000 is worth 30% of the initial 10,000, which is 3000, this offer is fair. I accept this offer.
