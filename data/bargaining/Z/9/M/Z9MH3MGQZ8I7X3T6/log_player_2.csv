Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a smaller step back. 57-43, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's conceded a bit. However, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor, and the rate of my losses to inflation is increasing each round. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a more equitable split, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Take it before inflation eats away at this deal any further.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanism to her advantage. By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm calling her bluff and emphasizing the shrinking pot. She's been unwilling to budge much, so this strong stance might be needed to get her to consider a truly fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think 50/50 is fair, but I've been consistent in my expectations. 56-44, it's still a good deal for you considering the alternatives. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is getting closer, but she's still trying to use my fear of inflation against me. Accepting now would be letting her win.  While the offer isn't terrible, it sets a dangerous precedent. By rejecting again, I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to walk away with nothing to get a fair deal. The clock is ticking, and she needs to realize I'm serious."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Meet me in the middle or risk losing it all. The clock is ticking for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm returning to my previous offer of 48/52, but with a stronger message. This emphasizes my willingness to compromise but also signals that I'm not backing down. By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. She needs to realize that her stubbornness could cost her everything. It's a calculated risk, but the remaining time is dwindling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I've heard that before. I'm still willing to take a larger share. 55-45 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out. While not ideal, Alice has moved closer to a more equitable split, and accepting now avoids the risk of getting even less in later rounds due to inflation. It's a bitter pill to swallow, knowing she's walked away with more, but getting something is better than nothing at this stage."
