"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a fair share, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. My message is a friendly reminder that we can end the game early if Bob accepts my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more equitable split is possible. This offer is fair and allows us to move forward.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 95% of $600,000, which is $570,000. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 95% of $583,333.33, which is $554,166.67.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is still a bit more favorable to him than my initial offer, but it's a relatively fair split. I'll accept this offer.
