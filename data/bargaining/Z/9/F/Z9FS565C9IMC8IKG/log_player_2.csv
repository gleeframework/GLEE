Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Time to decide. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is not great, continuing to reject it will only result in a lower payout for me in the future. Alice is not affected by inflation, so I need to accept this offer to secure any gains."
