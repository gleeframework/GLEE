Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly but slightly in my favor considering I'm taking the risk of the first move. This ensures we both benefit from avoiding inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nMy reasoning is that I can try to negotiate for a better offer in the next round, considering the 5% inflation rate might not be too significant yet. I'd like to see if I can get a more favorable split."
