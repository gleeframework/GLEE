"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm willing to take the majority, but I want you to have a decent share too. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is ""fair"" in the sense of a decent share, it's not fair to me in terms of what I can gain in the future.  The money is losing value quickly, so I need to try and get a bigger chunk now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that the money is losing value with each round.  Let's work together to maximize our gains.""}
