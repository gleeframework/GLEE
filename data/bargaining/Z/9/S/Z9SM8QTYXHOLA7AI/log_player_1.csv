"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no hard feelings! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I'm not getting a good deal with this split, especially considering the value of money is decreasing with each round. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'll give you 3000, and I'll take the rest.""
}

  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be generous, but I need a good chunk of the money to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
