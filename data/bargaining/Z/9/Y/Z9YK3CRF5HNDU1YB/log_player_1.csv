I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a large portion of the money.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to secure a good amount before the value decreases.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred a larger share, it's better to accept this offer.  Inflation means I'm losing a significant amount of value each round, and Bob's offer still gives me a substantial amount.  It's risky to keep playing and risk getting nothing at all."
