This is a tough situation. While accepting only $3000 feels incredibly unfair, it's the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The inflation is severe. In the next round, my potential gain diminishes even further, making a bad situation drastically worse. 
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob has shown no willingness to negotiate fairly. He's aware of the inflation working against me and is exploiting it.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Taking $3000 is a bitter pill to swallow, but it's better than walking away with nothing if I reject and we reach a point where an agreement is impossible. 

This highlights a key lesson about negotiation: understanding the power dynamics and the factors influencing both sides is crucial for achieving the best possible outcome."
