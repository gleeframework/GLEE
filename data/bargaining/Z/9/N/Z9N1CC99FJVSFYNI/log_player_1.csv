"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. However, I don't want to be too greedy, as I still want to reach a deal.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the fact that I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a slightly more aggressive proposal this time. I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! With the money being worth 14.26% less than the original, I'll need to be more cautious and make sure I get a good deal.

Considering Bob's offer, it seems like he's trying to get a slightly larger share, but it's not too aggressive. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
