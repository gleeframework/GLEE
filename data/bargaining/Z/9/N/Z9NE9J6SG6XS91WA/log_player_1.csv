Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI am offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is a friendly and reasonable approach to initiate the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer of a 40-60 split, as it is less favorable to me than my initial proposal. Considering the inflation, I am willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
