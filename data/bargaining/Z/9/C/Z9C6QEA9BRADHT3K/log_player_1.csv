"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give away all the money on the first round.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your offer, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share for taking on the risk of negotiating with you. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob is matching my original offer, I'll consider his proposal. However, I still think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the match, but I think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of negotiating further.""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for a 50-50 split just yet. I'll keep pushing for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. I'll try to get a better deal while Bob is still willing to negotiate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting any younger. I need to get a good deal while I can.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm still trying to maintain a slight edge. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I've been generous enough. I need a better deal to make this worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains. With my money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be very careful. However, Bob's offer is a significant improvement from my previous proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think I've pushed you hard enough, Bob. I'll take this deal. It's not ideal, but it's better than going further.""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the $4500. It's not a great deal, but it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse deal. Time to call it a day!"
