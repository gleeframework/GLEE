"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly, so we both get $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward proposal."

# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, I'm looking at a gain of $500,000, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so he's getting $600,000, which is equivalent to $480,000 in the first round.

Considering the offer, I'm getting $400,000, which is less than what I initially proposed, but Bob is getting a significantly larger share. I'm not sure if it's worth it, but I'll decide to reject this offer.
