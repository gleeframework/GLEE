"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a significant advantage, but it gives Bob something to start with.  Let's see if he's willing to take it or risk losing more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy!  I'll reject his offer.  Even though I'm losing value on the money, I'm still in a better position to make a counteroffer in the next round.  Let's see if he'll budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm reducing my offer to 85/15, acknowledging the inflation but still aiming for a good portion of the money. It's a compromise, but I'm confident I can still get a better deal than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. The inflation is hitting him harder, and he's still holding out for a big chunk of the money.  I'll reject again and see if we can reach a more balanced agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering 80/20.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that we're both losing value with each round, and we need to find a compromise soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still incredibly stubborn!  The inflation is hitting him harder than me, but he's clinging to his unrealistic expectations.  I'll reject his offer again.  We're running out of time, but I'm determined to get a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm offering 75/25.  The inflation is really starting to bite now. I'm making a big concession here, but I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value in coming to an agreement.  If we don't settle soon, we'll both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly delusional! His offer is still way too lopsided, even with the inflation impacting him more. I'm not giving in to his greed. We have to find a compromise, and it needs to be soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering 70/30. Time is running out, and I'm making one final concession to try and reach a deal. I'm giving up more than I'd like, but I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that this is the best we can both do in this situation.  If he rejects again, we're both going to lose everything."
