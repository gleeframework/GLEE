"Round 1
Alice's offer:

While Alice's proposal seems fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's try splitting it 55/45 with me getting the larger share, considering the higher inflation rate I'm facing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on you, I'm willing to take a bit more but still offer a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation rate is hitting me hard. This offer is still reasonable and I don't want to risk losing more money by continuing to reject."
