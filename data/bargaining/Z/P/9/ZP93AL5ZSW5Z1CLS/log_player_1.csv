"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better, let's split it 60-40, with me getting the larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like the fact that Bob is trying to take the larger share, and the fact that the offer is the same as my original proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's offer was the same as mine, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is a slight concession from my original 60-40 offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, 55-45 is a fair compromise""
}
```"
