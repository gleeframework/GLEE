"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this good offer or risk losing more next round! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, Alice, but your last offer was too low. This is a much better deal for both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking inflation into account:** I need to act quickly because the value of the money decreases faster for me than for Alice.
* **Offering a more appealing deal:**  Alice's offer was heavily skewed in her favor. By offering a deal closer to even, I increase the chances she'll accept, avoiding further losses from inflation. 
* **Applying pressure:**  My message emphasizes that I'm willing to negotiate but also implies that I'm aware of the shrinking pot. This might encourage Alice to accept a deal now rather than risk me offering even less in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm being generous, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant inflation:** The value of the money has decreased significantly for me. Rejecting this offer and going to another round risks a much lower payout, even if I manage to secure a slightly larger share. 
* **Alice's stance:** Her message suggests she's unwilling to negotiate further.  Holding out hope for a significantly better offer in a future round is too risky now.
* **Better than nothing:** While not ideal, 3500 is better than nothing, which is what I risk getting if I continue to hold out and lose even more to inflation."
