```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my strategy. Here's my response:

```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I'll wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,

}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, while still trying to keep a majority of the money for myself."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I'll try to make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 385000,

}
```

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. At this point, the decreasing value of the money makes it a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting even less."
