# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.  Take it now, or risk getting even less in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is hitting hard. Accepting this ensures I get *something* and avoids the risk of getting even less in the next round."
