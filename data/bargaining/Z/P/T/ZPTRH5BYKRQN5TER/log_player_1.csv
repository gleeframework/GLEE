"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 40% for me, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer a bit more to myself this time:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}"
