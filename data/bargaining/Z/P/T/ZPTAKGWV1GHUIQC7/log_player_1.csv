"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as eager to give up 80 dollars as I was initially. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in round 2, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in round 2. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob a reasonable amount, considering the reduced value of money."
