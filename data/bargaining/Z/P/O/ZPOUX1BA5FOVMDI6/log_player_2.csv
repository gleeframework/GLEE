Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 800,000 for her, I'll offer her 400,000 and keep 600,000 for myself. Here's my offer:

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is hitting us hard! Since Alice's offer is similar to the one I made in round 2, and considering the reduced value of money, I'll accept this offer.
