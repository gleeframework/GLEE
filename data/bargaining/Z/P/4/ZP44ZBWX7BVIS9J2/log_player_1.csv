 I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small share. I want to see if he's willing to accept it or if he's going to try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is being very greedy! He's trying to reverse our roles completely. I won't accept this. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm lowering my share slightly, but still keeping a significant portion of the money.  I want to see if Bob will accept a more balanced offer or if he's going to continue to be unreasonable."
