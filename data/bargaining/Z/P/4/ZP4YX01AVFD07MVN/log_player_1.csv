"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. I'm offering you a fair 40% to avoid drawn-out negotiations.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Position:**  Alice starts with the advantage.  Delay hurts her more than Bob due to the 20% inflation. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** A 60/40 split might seem generous from Bob's perspective, making him more likely to accept. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The message subtly reminds Bob that time is of the essence, and delaying only hurts them both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can do better for both of us. I'm offering you a more equitable 40%, but let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Shift:** Bob's offer is simply a reversal of Alice's initial offer, taking advantage of the inflation to claim a larger share.
* **Negotiating Power:** Accepting now would show weakness and likely lead to Bob pushing for even less favorable terms in subsequent rounds.  
* **Time Pressure:** While inflation is a concern, there's still time to negotiate a better deal.  Alice needs to signal she's willing to walk away to get Bob to take her seriously."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for me in this game. I'm willing to meet you halfway to end this now. 55/45, take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Firmly:**  Alice recognizes she needs to move closer to the middle ground, offering a 55/45 split. This is a significant concession from her initial offer. 
* **Deadline Pressure:** By phrasing it as ""take it or leave it,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency. Bob knows she's serious and further delays will only hurt them both.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  There's a risk Bob might reject this and try to push for an even better deal. However, Alice is betting that the combination of a reasonable offer and time pressure will be enough to convince him."
