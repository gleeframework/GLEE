"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering you $3,000, and I'll take $7,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the effective value of the money for Bob in Round 4. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, the actual amount he's offering is:

$4,000 / (1 - 0.488) = $7,619

Since I'm not getting a better deal than my previous offer, I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}
```

I'm offering you $2,500, and I'll take $7,500."
