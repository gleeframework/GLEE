"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will agree and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, my gain of $60 in this round is equivalent to $57.50 in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not proceed to the next round if I can get a better deal now.
