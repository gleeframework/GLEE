"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'll get the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $80 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $72. Bob's gain of $20 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $19.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there yet, Bob. I'm looking for a better split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of its original value, which is $64.80. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Compromise is key. Let's find a fair middle ground.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the current $100, which is $45, and keeping 55% for myself, which is $55."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but still a bit too low for me 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $80 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is $58.20. Bob's gain of $20 is now worth 94.74% of its original value, which is $19.05.

Considering Bob's new offer, I notice that the split is the same as in round 2, but with the adjusted values. I'll decide to reject it, since I'm still hoping for a better deal.
