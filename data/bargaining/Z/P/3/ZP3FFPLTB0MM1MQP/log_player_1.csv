"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I'm getting a smaller share, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob."
