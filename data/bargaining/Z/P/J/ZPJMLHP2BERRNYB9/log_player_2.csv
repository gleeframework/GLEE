"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself with more rounds.  Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering Alice 4000, and keeping 6000 for myself. This is a fair split considering the inflation factor, and I'm confident she'll accept.  Let's see if she agrees!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'll accept this offer.  Even though it's a 50/50 split, it's better than risking getting nothing due to inflation.  I'm not sure what Alice's strategy is, but it's better to take what I can get."
