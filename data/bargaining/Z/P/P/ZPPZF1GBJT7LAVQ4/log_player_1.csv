I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  It's a generous offer, considering I could take all the money!  But I want to be fair.  Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'll take it."
