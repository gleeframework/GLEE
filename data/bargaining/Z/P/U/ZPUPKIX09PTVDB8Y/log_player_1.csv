"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 
I propose a 5500/4500 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer, as it gives Bob a significant portion of the money while still ensuring I receive a majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  Since the money is now worth less due to inflation, I believe a fair and equitable split is the best way to move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I recognize that the inflation is making the money worth less with each passing round.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option to ensure I receive a significant portion of the remaining money."
