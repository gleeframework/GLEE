Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm not willing to give up that much. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise, considering the shrinking value of the money. Let's end this before we both lose more.

# Alice gain: 600000
