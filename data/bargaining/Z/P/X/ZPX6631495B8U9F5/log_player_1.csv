"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share for now. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving Bob a relatively small share to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share. Will you consider this? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my proposed gain of 6000$ is worth 80% of the original 8000$, and Bob's proposed gain of 4000$ is worth 95% of the original 4200$.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit too generous for me. Can you consider giving me a bit more?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my proposed gain of 6000$ is worth 80% of the original 8000$, and Bob's proposed gain of 4000$ is worth 95% of the original 4200$. I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a slightly larger share. Will you accept?""
}
```

I've increased my proposed gain to 6400$, which is worth 80% of the original 8000$, and decreased Bob's proposed gain to 3600$, which is worth 95% of the original 3780$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Will you accept this compromise? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my proposed gain of 5000$ is worth 50% of the original 8000$, and Bob's proposed gain of 5000$ is worth 59.52% of the original 4200$.

Considering the compromise, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and accept the equal split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept the 50-50 split. It's a fair compromise.""
}
```"
