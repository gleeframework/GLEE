Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share remains the same, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, time is running out, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. This is my compromise. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my diminishing returns. While she's right that time is running out, her offer is barely budging.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair share while there's still time to negotiate a meaningful amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.  Accept this offer, or we both lose out."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aiming for a larger share and banking on my desperation as inflation eats away at my potential gains.  A firm 50/50 offer sends a clear message: I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This strategy maximizes the chance of a fair outcome while there's still something worthwhile left to negotiate for."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure, but I still believe I deserve a bit more. This is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It pains me to accept this, but time is no longer on my side.  Alice is unlikely to budge further, and accepting this offer is better than risking a complete loss if we run out of rounds.  It's a bitter pill, but a necessary one to avoid walking away with nothing."
