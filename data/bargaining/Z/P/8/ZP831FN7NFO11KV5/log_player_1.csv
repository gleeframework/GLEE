"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 60/40 split, but I'm not sure if I want to reject it either.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will make a better one in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, since Bob's offer was 60/40 and I'm not sure if he'll make a better one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting less, I'm getting more, take it or leave it""
}
```

This offer is a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Let's see if Bob will accept it."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

With inflation, the money is worth less and less, so I want to make the most of it. 4800 is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob 5200.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will make a better one in the next round."

Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking more, you're getting less, deal with it""
}
```

This offer is a 60/40 split, which is even more favorable to me than before. Let's see if Bob will accept it."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, I'll try to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I want to give Bob 4600, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation.

However, 5400 is a decent offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that the game will end soon."
