Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
