"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. Take 10% and we can call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away at your potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 52.5/47.5.  This gives you a good amount, and with inflation, the value will only go down if we keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice's offer is now reasonable and getting closer to an even split.  Continuing to play risks me getting even less as inflation eats away at the value.
