"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering you get to keep more of the money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, and I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'd rather wait for the next round and make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more since the money is worth less now.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
