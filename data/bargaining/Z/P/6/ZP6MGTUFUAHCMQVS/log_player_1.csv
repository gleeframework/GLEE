Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I'll consider Bob's offer.
