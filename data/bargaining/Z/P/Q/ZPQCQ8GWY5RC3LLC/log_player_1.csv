"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small lead, but it's a good starting point. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to take a bigger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, trying to take a bigger share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority, but I need some consolation prize. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a comeback! Given the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to take advantage of the situation. However, I'll accept this offer since it's a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a better deal than my previous offer.
