"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. I understand you want a good deal, but this is a chance for both of us to benefit. How about a 60/40 split?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's split it 72/28.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a bit more, the inflation is working heavily in my favor. It's still better to hold out for a more even split.  Alice's share is losing value fast, which gives me leverage."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and the value is dropping fast.  My offer is more than generous considering the circumstances. Let's settle this now with 65/35.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm also putting a bit more pressure on Alice. The longer this goes on, the more she stands to lose."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and split it 57.6/42.4. This is the best we can do given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4240 
# Alice gain: 5760 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally feeling the heat of the inflation, but this offer is still unacceptable. While it's closer to a fair split considering the depreciating value, time is on my side. Every round that passes gives me a significant advantage. I need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you 3000 dollars. This is more than fair considering the lost value. Take this deal, or the next offer will be even less appealing for you.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm taking a more aggressive stance this round. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and I need to press my advantage.  By offering a 70/30 split, I'm showing that I'm serious about getting a deal that reflects the current state of the game, and I'm also giving her a clear warning that waiting will only benefit me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are both losing out significantly.  Let's split it 46.08/53.92 to salvage something before we both end up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 5392 
# Alice gain: 4608 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a close call, but the risk of walking away with nothing is becoming too great. While I still have some negotiating power, Alice's offer now represents a reasonable split considering the significant inflation we're both experiencing. It's better to secure a win now than to risk everything with a potentially worse outcome in later rounds."
