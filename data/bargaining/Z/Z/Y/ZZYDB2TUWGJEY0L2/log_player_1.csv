I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm going to assume it doesn't affect him at all and hope he takes the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a fair split and the inflation doesn't affect my gains this round, so I'll take it."
