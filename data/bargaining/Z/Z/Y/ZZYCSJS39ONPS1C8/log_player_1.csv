"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor. I'm aiming for a high initial offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly while inflation hasn't hit too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is tempting due to inflation, it's still a very unfavorable deal. It's worth pushing for a more equitable split, especially as I'll be the one making the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 80/20 split. While the money is losing value, I'm still aiming for a substantial share. This should be appealing to Bob, as it's significantly better than the 5/95 split he proposed."
