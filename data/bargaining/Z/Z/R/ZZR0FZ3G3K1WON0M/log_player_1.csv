"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. A 50/50 split is the most equitable solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a 50/50 split, but the inflation hurts you more than me. This is a compromise, and it's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing later.""

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is a factor, but so is fairness. This offer recognizes your advantage while acknowledging I need a reasonable share too. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate and trying to frame his offer as generous.  However, he's still getting the better end of the deal due to the rapidly increasing inflation working against him.  I need to hold out for a better offer."

{
""alice_gain"": 5100,

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking to my principles of a fair split that accounts for the inflation disadvantage. Time is running out, and I'm offering you a chance to secure a reasonable sum. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to leverage the time pressure, but his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor due to the inflation. I need to remain firm and wait for a better deal.  The next few rounds will be crucial."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's time to be realistic.  I'm offering a straight 50/50 split.  This is the most fair deal you'll get considering the inflation working against you.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning. While I held out for a better deal in the early rounds, the increasing inflation means Bob's perceived value of the money is dropping rapidly.  A 50/50 split is now a strategically strong offer. It signals fairness and emphasizes the urgency of the situation for Bob."
