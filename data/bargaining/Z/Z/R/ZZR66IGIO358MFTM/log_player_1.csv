I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer. Accepting this will guarantee me some money, and with the inflation, I'm unsure if I'll get anything better in future rounds."
