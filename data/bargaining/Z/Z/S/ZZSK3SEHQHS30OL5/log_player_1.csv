"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer.  Let's see if we can agree here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, but I still need to make the most of it.

I'll think about Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite ready to accept this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if we can get an even better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make a new offer. With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth even less, so I'll aim to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about this revised split?""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
