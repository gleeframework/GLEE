I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, giving Bob 10% of the money. This leaves me with 90% of the money. I'll see how he reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial offer. While my offer gave him 10% of the money, his offer gives me only 25% of the money. I'll reject this and make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob slightly, hoping to secure a deal. Due to the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'm willing to give Bob 30% of the money to secure a win."
