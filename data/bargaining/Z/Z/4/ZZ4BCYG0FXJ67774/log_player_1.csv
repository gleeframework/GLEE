"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game early!"

Round 2

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to flip the script!

I'll reject this offer since it's still a 60-40 split, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced a 60-40 split is fair. I'd like to propose a different split in the next round.""
