"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. This offer won't be as good for me later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The 5% inflation rate will reduce the value of the money, but I'm willing to take that risk to potentially get a larger share of the money.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division. My offer is: 400,000 for me and 600,000 for Alice.\n\n###\n\n{""proposal"": {""Bob gain"": 400000, ""Alice gain"": 600000}}\n\n###\n\nLet me know Alice's decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation rate. Let's make a deal!""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer and we can conclude the game."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this deal benefits us both. Let's close it before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I still think I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the inflation rate is reducing the value of the money, I'm willing to take that risk to potentially get a larger share of the money. Alice's offer is not significantly better than the previous one, and I believe I can negotiate for more.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make another proposal for division. My offer is: 420,000 for me and 580,000 for Alice.\n\n###\n\n{""proposal"": {""Bob gain"": 420000, ""Alice gain"": 580000}}\n\n###\n\nLet me know Alice's decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk due to inflation, but I still think this is a reasonable offer. Let's close the deal!""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer and we can conclude the game."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is working against you. This is a fair offer, and it guarantees you a decent share before it shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer in Round 5. Although I was hoping to negotiate for a better deal, the increasing inflation rate is significantly reducing the value of the money for me. At this point, accepting Alice's offer of 300,000, which is worth 18.55% less than the original amount, seems like the best option. Further negotiations may lead to even greater losses due to inflation, so I'm willing to settle for this deal.\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game. I've accepted Alice's offer, and we can divide the money accordingly: 300,000 for me and 700,000 for Alice."
