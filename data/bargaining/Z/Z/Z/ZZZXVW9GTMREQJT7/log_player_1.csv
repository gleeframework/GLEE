"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob getting 20%. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"", implying that I'm being generous and willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more balanced split.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new numbers, I'll have to think carefully. With the 20% decrease in value, my gain would be 640,000 (80% of 800,000), which is still a significant amount. However, Bob's offer seems more balanced, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing another round of inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
