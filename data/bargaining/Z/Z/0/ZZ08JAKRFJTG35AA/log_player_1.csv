I propose a 9000/1000 split, with me getting the majority. I'm aiming for a quick resolution but I'm willing to negotiate in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a 5500/4500 split. This is a more balanced approach considering Bob's inflated gains. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split,  Bob's gains are significantly inflated now, making his offer relatively generous considering the circumstances. Accepting this will at least secure a decent amount."
