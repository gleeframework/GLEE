"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the adjusted values.

For round 2, my gain of 50 is actually worth 50 * 0.9 = 45 (since it's 10% less than the original 50).

Bob's gain of 50 is worth 50 * 0.95 = 47.5 (since it's 5% less than the original 50).

Considering the adjusted values, I'll decide:

```
