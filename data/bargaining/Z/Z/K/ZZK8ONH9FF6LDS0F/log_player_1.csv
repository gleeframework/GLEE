"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a more balanced split. This offer is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gains are worth 10% less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gains are worth 10% less than in the previous round, due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Consider this offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but still a fair split considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. This offer is fair and reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing my gains by 27.1% compared to the first round, I need to be cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this offer is fair and reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it. A 50-50 split seems like a good compromise, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
