Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. This offer is more balanced and gives us both a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a tough one! Let me calculate. 

Right now, Bob is offering me $400,000. If I reject and win a similar deal in the next round, it will only be worth $320,000 due to inflation (400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000). 

Bob is losing money faster than me, so waiting might seem good. However, there's a risk he'll offer me even less next round. 

This offer is heavily skewed in Bob's favor.  I need to take a risk to try and get more.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more fair considering the inflation we're facing. Let's close the deal before we lose more money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting frustrating. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. Let's analyze:

* **Current Offer:** Bob offers $450,000, which is a far cry from my initial proposal.
* **Inflation Impact:**  If I reject and manage to secure the same amount next round, it'll be worth only $364,000 due to inflation (450,000 * 0.8 = 364,000).
* **Time Pressure:**  We're already at Round 4, and the clock is ticking. The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. 

I need to decide if I'm willing to risk getting even less in later rounds.  Bob is being stubborn, but he also risks losing more than me with his higher share.

I'll take a calculated risk and reject this offer. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a better deal.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's be practical and settle on a split that's fair to us both, considering the inflation.  This offer is a step closer to my previous proposal. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is getting closer to a reasonable split, but the clock is ticking. Let's analyze:

* **The Offer:**  $480,000 isn't ideal, but it's better than his previous offer.
* **Inflation's Bite:** If I reject and get this same offer next round, it'll only be worth $387,840 (480,000 * 0.8 = 387,840) due to inflation.  
* **Time Crunch:**  We're past the halfway point! The risk of getting nothing is increasing rapidly.  

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure too, and his offer reflects that. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting now guarantees a decent amount and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing. 

This is a tough call, but I think it's time to cut my losses and secure a win.
