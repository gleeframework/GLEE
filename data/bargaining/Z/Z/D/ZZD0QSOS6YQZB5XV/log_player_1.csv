Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get 60 dollars and Bob will get 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a slightly larger share to account for the inflation, but still leave you with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I understand Bob's reasoning about accounting for inflation. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and proceed to the next round. I hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the reduced value of money due to inflation. I hope Bob will consider this offer and accept it."
