I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is making things difficult. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option in this situation, as I'm unlikely to get a better offer in the next round."
