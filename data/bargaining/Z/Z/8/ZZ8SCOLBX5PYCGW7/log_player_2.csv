"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""My turn to propose a fair split considering the inflation. This offer will benefit us both.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Considering Inflation:** It's crucial to factor in the decreasing value of the money. While Alice's offer might seem fair at first glance, Bob loses value faster.
* **Strategic Offer:**  Offering Alice slightly more than she would have received in the previous round (6000 * 0.9 = 5400) creates a strong incentive for her to accept.
* **Future Rounds:**  If Alice rejects this offer, the value decreases further. In the next round, Bob would need to offer even more to make it worthwhile for himself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've taken the inflation into account, let's settle this! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both players, especially to Bob.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a marginally better offer in future rounds is becoming increasingly risky. The potential gains are shrinking rapidly due to the inflation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  While not ideal, Alice's offer is relatively close to a fair split considering the inflation rates. Accepting now secures a decent amount before it depreciates further."
