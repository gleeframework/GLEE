"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable offer, considering we're both trying to maximize our gains. I'll attach a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it evenly! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, Bob's offer of $400,000 is actually equivalent to $320,000 in the previous round. Considering this, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the inflation and try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less to me than in the first round, and another 20% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.\n\nI'll offer Bob $500,000 and keep $500,000 for myself. However, considering the inflation, my $500,000 is actually equivalent to $400,000 in the first round, and $320,000 in the second round. I'll attach a message saying ""Meet me in the middle"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nLet's see how Bob responds!"
