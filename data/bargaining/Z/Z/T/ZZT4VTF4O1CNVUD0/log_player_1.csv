Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  Let's see if Bob is happy with that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept this offer.  It's a fair split, and I'd rather get something than risk losing even more money with inflation."
