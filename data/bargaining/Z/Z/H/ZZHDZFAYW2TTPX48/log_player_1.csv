"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob. No need to negotiate, let's just divide it fairly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, as it's the most straightforward and fair way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more for being the better negotiator 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the decreasing value of money due to inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not a great deal for me. I think I can do better than 40. Let's try again.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and still getting a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 42, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's not the best deal I've seen so far, I don't want to risk going too low. I'll accept this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take 42. Let's finalize the deal.""
}
```"
