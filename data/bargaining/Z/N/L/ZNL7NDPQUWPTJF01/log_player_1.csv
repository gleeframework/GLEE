"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30, which is a relatively fair split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more fair. I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm open to negotiation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $45 * 0.95 = $42.75
Bob gain: $55 * 0.95 = $52.25

I'll accept this offer.
