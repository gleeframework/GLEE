Round 5

Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While she's offering a slight compromise, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the increasing inflation impact on Bob's potential earnings.  We need to push for a more agreeable split, even with the time pressure."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. I'll give you a little more, but not too much 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob receives something rather than nothing if we continue to hold out for a better deal and time runs out.  The rounds are progressing, and the inflation is eating significantly into Bob's potential earnings. It's a tough decision, but better to secure something now than risk losing everything."
