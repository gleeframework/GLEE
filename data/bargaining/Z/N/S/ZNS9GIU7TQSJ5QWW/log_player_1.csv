"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me getting 70 dollars and Bob getting 30 dollars. I'm starting with a fair split to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice. We both get a fair share, and we can move on to more important things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I'm not too thrilled about the split, but I'm willing to accept a fair share. I'll take Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
