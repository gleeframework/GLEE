"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $160,000 in the original amount. This is a very low offer, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. My gain would be worth $160,000 in the original amount, so I'll aim to get at least that much.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, 400k for me, 600k for you. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway and give him a larger share, while still getting a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up with us!

Considering the offer, my gain of $300,000 is worth $160,000 in the original amount, which is actually a bit less than what I got in round 2. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth 64.8% of its original value due to inflation. My gain would be worth $64,000 in the original amount, so I'll aim to get at least that much.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, 320k for me, 680k for you. I'm trying to find a sweet spot.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and giving Bob a significant share, considering the effects of inflation."
