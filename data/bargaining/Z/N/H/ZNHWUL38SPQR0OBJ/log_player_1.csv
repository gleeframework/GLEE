"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to take most of the money!  Since we don't know how inflation impacts Bob, I'm hoping he'll take the small offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would love to keep 99 dollars, the risk of Bob rejecting my offer again and getting nothing is too high. Accepting a 50/50 split guarantees me a decent share of the money, especially since we don't know how inflation will affect future rounds."
