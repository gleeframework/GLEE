"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and efficient, Bob. This is a good deal for both of us considering the time value of money. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it's a decent split, I can do better. I'm not convinced it's truly ""fair and efficient"" when considering the time value of money for both of us. Let's see if I can get a more advantageous deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a slight risk here, Alice. Let's be realistic about the time value of money. This is a fairer offer in my opinion, and accepting it means we can get this over with quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is right. The clock is ticking, and the value of the money is decreasing. While I could try to push for more, there's a chance we'll both end up with less if we keep rejecting offers.  A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further losses."
