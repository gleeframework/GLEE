"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep $9000 for myself and give $1000 to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. While I understand inflation has devalued my potential gains, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  I'm willing to see what offers the next rounds bring."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I offer to take $8000 and give Bob $2000.  While my potential gain is lower due to inflation, I believe this offer is still fair and gives Bob a significant share. I hope to avoid further rounds of negotiation and reach a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly decreased the value of my potential earnings, accepting this offer is the best option. If I reject, the next round would see my potential earnings decrease even further, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer secures me a substantial amount of money, even considering inflation."
