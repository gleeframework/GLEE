4500.0,5500.0,"Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split? This accounts for the fact that the money will be worth less as time goes on, impacting you more than me.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Okay, I'm willing to budge a little.  Let's go with a 52/48 split. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation we're both facing.  What do you say?",Alice,3,

4900.0,5100.0,"Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation is working against you. I'm offering 51/49. It's more than my last offer, reflecting the time pressure, and still fair considering the depreciation.",Bob,4,
