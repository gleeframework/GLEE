Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 3 of the game. In the previous rounds, both my offer and Bob's offer were rejected. The money I gain is still worth 100%, but for Bob, it's now worth 90% of its original value due to a 10% decrease in value each round.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on Bob's gain
Given that the money Bob gains decreases in value by 10% each round, and we are now in Round 3, the actual value of the money Bob would receive is 90% of its face value. This means if Bob were to receive $X, its actual value to him would be $0.9X.

### Step 3: Determine a fair offer considering inflation
To make an offer that Bob might find acceptable, I need to consider the perceived value to him after inflation. A ""fair"" split in terms of perceived value might be closer to 50/50 of the actual value we each perceive. However, given that Bob's money is worth less, I can offer him slightly less than half of the total amount, but still make it appealing by highlighting the decreasing value over time.

### Step 4: Calculate the offer amounts
Given the considerations above, I'll offer Bob slightly less than half, taking into account the decreasing value for him but also trying to appear generous. Let's say I offer him $4800, which to him would be worth $4320 after the 10% decrease, and I'll take $5200.

### Step 5: Formulate the message
The message should convey a sense of fairness and urgency due to the decreasing value of the money for Bob. It could be something like, ""Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer. Let's settle before the value drops further!""

### Step 6: Prepare the offer in JSON format
Based on the calculations and considerations, the offer would be:
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer. Let's settle before the value drops further!""}

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer. Let's settle before the value drops further!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, this is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer considering the inflation
Bob's offer gives me $4700, which is worth 100% of its face value to me, and he takes $5300, which is worth 72.9% of its face value to him due to the 27.1% decrease in value.

### Step 2: Calculate the perceived value for both parties
For me, the perceived value is $4700. For Bob, the perceived value is $5300 * 0.729 = $3865.70.

### Step 3: Compare the offer to a 50/50 split in perceived value
A 50/50 split in perceived value would mean each of us gets $5000 of perceived value. Since the actual value to me is the same as the perceived value, and I'm being offered $4700, this is less than a 50/50 split in perceived value.

### Step 4: Consider the decreasing value over time for Bob
Given that the value of the money decreases for Bob with each round, he is under pressure to settle. However, I should also be cautious not to let the rounds drag on too long, as after 12 rounds, neither of us gets anything.

### Step 5: Decide whether to accept or reject the offer
Considering that Bob's offer does not meet the 50/50 split in perceived value and that the pressure is more on him due to the decreasing value of his share, I will reject this offer.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 5 of the game. The money I gain is still worth 100%, but for Bob, it's now worth 72.9% of its original value due to the cumulative decrease in value each round.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on Bob's gain
Given that the value of the money for Bob has decreased by 27.1%, I should adjust my offer to reflect this change while still trying to appear fair and enticing.

### Step 3: Determine a fair offer considering inflation
Since Bob is under increasing pressure due to the decreasing value of his share, I can offer him slightly less than before but still frame it as a generous offer given the circumstances. Aiming for a perceived 50/50 split might not be necessary, as Bob's decreasing value might make him more inclined to accept a slightly less favorable offer.

### Step 4: Calculate the offer amounts
Considering the above, I might offer Bob a bit less than in the previous round but still make it appealing. Let's say I offer him $5000, which to him would be worth $3645 after the 27.1% decrease, and I'll take $5000.

### Step 5: Formulate the message
The message should emphasize the urgency due to inflation and present the offer as more than fair under the circumstances. It could be, ""Given the significant decrease in value for you, this offer is more than generous. It's wise to accept before it drops further.""

### Step 6: Prepare the offer in JSON format
Based on the calculations and considerations, the offer would be:
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Given the significant decrease in value for you, this offer is more than generous. It's wise to accept before it drops further.""}

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Given the significant decrease in value for you, this offer is more than generous. It's wise to accept before it drops further.""}"
