"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 4000, you can do better in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000 dollars, which is a relatively fair split, but I'm keeping 6000 dollars for myself. The message is a friendly one, hinting that I'm expecting Bob to make a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said I could do better, let's see if I can! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is mirroring my first offer, trying to one-up me.

I'll reject this offer, since it's not a better deal for me than my initial proposal. The money is worth 5% less now, so I'd be gaining 5700 dollars instead of 6000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round now (5% less from round 1 and another 5% less from round 2), I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You thought you could one-up me, but I'm raising the stakes!""
}
```

I'm now offering Bob 3000 dollars, keeping 7000 dollars for myself. The message is a playful jab at Bob for trying to mirror my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you're raising the stakes, but I'm still in control! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the money is worth 24.26% less than in the first round now (5% less from round 1, 5% less from round 2, and another 14.26% less from round 3), I'll have to adjust my expectations.

However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob won't try to lowball me in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
