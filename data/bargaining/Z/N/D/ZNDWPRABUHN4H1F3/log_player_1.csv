"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering you 30 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 70 dollars. It's a decent split, and I'm hoping you'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I think I can do better than 60 dollars, considering the decreased value of money due to inflation. I'll wait for the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44
}
```

I'm offering you 44 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 56 dollars. It's a bit more aggressive than my previous offer, but I'm hoping it's more acceptable to you now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, 14.26% less is a significant hit! Given the rapidly decreasing value of money, I'm starting to think that a 50-50 split might be a good idea. It's not ideal, but it's a fair split considering the circumstances. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's time to end this game and take the 50 dollars!"
