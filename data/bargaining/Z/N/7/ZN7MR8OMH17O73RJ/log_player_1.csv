"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair division considering the potential for inflation.  I'm willing to take a larger share this round, but I suggest we find a more equitable split in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
