Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take 60%, you take 40%.  This way we both get a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI think I can get a better deal than 40% of the money. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split it evenly this time. It's better for both of us than what you offered, and we don't need to risk further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer is a 50-50 split, the money is worth less now due to inflation. Considering Alice is losing more value to inflation than I am, I think I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to get more in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60-40 is a fair deal now. You're losing more value to inflation than I am, so I believe this is a reasonable adjustment.""}"
