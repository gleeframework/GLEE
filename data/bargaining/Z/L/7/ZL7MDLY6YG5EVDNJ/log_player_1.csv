"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""This seems like a fair starting point, don't you think, Bob?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to minimize inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While splitting evenly seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. Bob knows this and is trying to secure a good deal early. I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""How about we meet a bit closer to the middle, Bob? It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the high inflation on your side, I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is using the inflation against me, but his offer is still not acceptable.  While my potential gains are decreasing, I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting 45% now would be significantly less than what I could have gotten in earlier rounds.  The inflation hurts, but I'm willing to gamble that Bob will become more reasonable in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""This is a serious offer, Bob.  We both need to benefit before the inflation eats away at the value.  Let's be realistic.""
}
