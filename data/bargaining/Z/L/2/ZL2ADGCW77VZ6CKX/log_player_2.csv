Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly, Bob. A 55/45 split seems like a good starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm not happy with a 55/45 split. I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation advantage I have. Let's see if we can work something out.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're in a stronger position, but 60/40 is too much. I'm willing to compromise at 48/52. It's a fair deal considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
