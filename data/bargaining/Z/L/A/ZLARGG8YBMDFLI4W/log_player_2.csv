"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the majority, but I want to make sure we both get something.  You have 12 rounds to make a better offer if you want. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

It's a good idea to see if Alice is willing to negotiate more.  I'm not going to accept a deal where I only get 1% of the money.  Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I think a 45/55 split is fair. Let's start with that, and we can always negotiate more if we need to.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share. 60/40 is a fair split considering the value of the money is decreasing each round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still holding on to a larger portion of the money, and while I'm willing to compromise, I won't accept a deal that gives her a 60% share.  I'll try to negotiate a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 490000, ""alice_gain"": 510000, ""message"": ""Let's try 49/51. This is closer to a 50/50 split, which I think is the fairest way to divide the money.  Time is running out, and we need to find a solution that benefits us both.""}
