"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a bit more this time, but I'm sure you'll get a good deal if we go to the next round.  Let's see how much you value your chance to get more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the offer from Bob.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with the 40-60 split, especially since the money is worth 10% less than before. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the risk of inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
