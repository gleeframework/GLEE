"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be careful with the numbers.

I'll think about it... Hmm, 3000 is a bit low for me, considering the original amount was $10,000. I'd rather not accept this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% decrease in value due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer."
