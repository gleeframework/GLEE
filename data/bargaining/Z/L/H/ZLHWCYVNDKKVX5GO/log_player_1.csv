"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000.  I want to secure the majority of the money in the first round, as the inflation rate is much higher for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I offer Bob $4,000 and myself $6,000.  This is a better deal for him than the last round, and it leaves some room for negotiation in the future.  I'm hoping to secure a larger share of the money before inflation takes effect further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is now significantly more favorable for him due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I receive something, whereas if I reject it, there's a high chance I'll receive nothing in the next round."
