I'm not going to accept such an unfair offer.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Round 3

# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

``` 

With only a few rounds left and the value of money decreasing rapidly, it's time to accept a fair offer.  An even split is a good outcome, considering the potential for both of us getting nothing."
