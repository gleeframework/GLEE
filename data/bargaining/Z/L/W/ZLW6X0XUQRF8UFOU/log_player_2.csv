"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  1,000 is a very small share of the money, and I'm hoping to get more. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500} 
``` 
I propose a 5500/4500 split in my favor.  It's a fair offer, considering that I'm taking a larger share.  Let's see if Alice will accept it!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Even with the inflation, I'm still going to reject this offer.  I'm hoping to get a bigger share, especially since Alice seems to be reluctant to give up more. Let's see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 6000/4000.  Alice seems stubborn, but maybe she'll start to see the value in this deal as we get closer to the deadline!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Inflation is really hitting hard now, but I still think I can get a better deal.  Alice is clearly trying to push me into accepting a smaller share, but I'm going to hold out for a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500} 
``` 

I'm raising my offer again to 6500/3500.  The time is running out, and I'm confident that Alice will eventually accept.  She's going to lose out on a significant amount of money if we don't reach an agreement soon!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

With inflation hitting hard, I'm going to accept this offer. A 50/50 split isn't ideal, but it's better than getting nothing at all. Alice seems to be sticking to a firm stance, and I don't want to risk losing all the money."
