"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'm keeping the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a different split. I'll take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my gain accordingly.

My gain would be 400,000 * 0.95 = 380,000

I'm not interested in this offer, as I'd be losing $20,000 compared to my original offer. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""My revised offer. Still a fair split, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the original amount, and keeping $550,000 for myself."
