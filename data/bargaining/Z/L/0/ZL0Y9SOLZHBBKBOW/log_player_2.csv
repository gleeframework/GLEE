"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer heavily favors me, Bob, but consider the alternative - if we don't make a deal, we both lose a lot of money. Let's be efficient and wrap this up now.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be realistic.  You're focused on what you get now, but I'm factoring in the rapid devaluation.  Every round we stall, the pot shrinks significantly *for me*.  Accept this offer, and we both walk away with a substantial sum. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me, but her offer is still incredibly unbalanced. I need to show strength and willingness to walk away, otherwise she'll keep lowballing me."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation is a factor for you, but I'm demonstrating my own willingness to negotiate. This revised offer is a fair compromise, recognizing both the initial value and the time pressure.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we need to find a middle ground quickly. This offer recognizes the time pressure we're both under. Let's secure a win-win before the value deteriorates further. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is inching closer to a more balanced deal, but she's still heavily favoring herself.  It's clear she's feeling the pressure of the inflation. I'll hold out a bit longer to see if I can secure a better offer.  We're approaching the halfway point, so the pressure will intensify."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer. We're past the halfway point and the clock is ticking.  This split acknowledges the initial value and the increasing pressure from inflation.  Let's end this negotiation now and secure a fair outcome for both of us.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time!  This offer is more than fair to you, especially given how much value is disappearing with each passing round. Let's be sensible and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The tide is turning. While not ideal, this offer is finally in a range where it's becoming risky to reject. The inflation is heavily eroding Alice's potential gains, making her more willing to compromise. If I push further, I risk losing a decent deal and potentially walking away with nothing.  It's better to secure a win now than gamble on a slightly better outcome later."
