"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a relatively even split, with a slight bias in my favor. I'll take $55 and offer Bob $45. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair split, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob has offered a perfectly even split, I'll accept it. The fact that the money is worth 10% less in this round doesn't change the fairness of the split, and I don't want to risk losing more value to inflation in future rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What happens next?"
