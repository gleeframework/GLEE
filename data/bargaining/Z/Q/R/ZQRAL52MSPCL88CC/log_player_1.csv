Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share, but my turn now. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

Now it's my turn again. Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### 

It seems like we're in Round 3 now. Here's my next offer:


{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is rising, and I need a bigger share""}\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing with every round. Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### 

I've decided to accept Bob's offer. It seems like the inflation is taking a toll on both of our potential gains, and splitting it evenly seems like the most reasonable decision at this point."
