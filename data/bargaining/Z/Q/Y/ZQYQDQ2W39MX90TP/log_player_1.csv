"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I propose to keep 990,000 dollars and give Bob 10,000 dollars.  I believe this is a fair offer, given that I have to deal with inflation, and it gives Bob a chance to get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm not thrilled with only getting $100,000, it's better than nothing, and I can't be sure how the inflation will affect Bob's future offers."
