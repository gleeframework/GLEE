Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's still aiming for a larger share than seems reasonable given the circumstances.  While the difference between her offer and my previous offer is shrinking, I believe I can still push for a slightly better deal in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly even split.  Any more haggling and we both risk losing too much to inflation.  Let's be logical and end this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play the ""fairness"" and ""logic"" cards strongly.  By now, Alice should be feeling the heat of the inflation significantly. An even split is palatable, even if not ideal, and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing if the rounds run out."
