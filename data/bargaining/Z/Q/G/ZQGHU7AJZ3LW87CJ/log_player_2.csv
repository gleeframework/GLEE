"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I want most of the money. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer might seem appealing at first, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Rejecting this offer gives me the chance to make a counter-proposal in the next round.  With inflation, my potential gains could be significantly better than a mere $10."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money fairly. This offer gives us both a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our earnings."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate. This offer is closer to a fair split, and we can avoid further inflation risks. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher share, accepting this offer is the best choice. With inflation, the value of the money is declining rapidly.  Rejecting could lead to a worse offer in the next round, and a further decrease in the value of my earnings.  It's better to secure a decent share now than risk losing more."
