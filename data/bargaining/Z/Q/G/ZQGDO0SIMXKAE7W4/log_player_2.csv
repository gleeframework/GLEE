"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money in an 80-20 ratio. This seems fair given the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.

# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""I think I can do better than 20% for myself. Let's try a more aggressive split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 64-36 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 36 
# Alice gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
