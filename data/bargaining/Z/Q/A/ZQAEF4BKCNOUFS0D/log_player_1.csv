Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's try to find a more optimal split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in Round 1, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in Round 1.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting 55 dollars and Bob getting 45 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more to account for inflation, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gains. With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in Round 1, I need to be careful.

However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower-value gains.
