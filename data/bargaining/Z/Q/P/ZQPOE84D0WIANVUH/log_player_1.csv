Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that heavily favors me. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept a smaller share in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though the money is worth less now due to inflation, 5000 is a decent share, and it's likely that in the next round, I'll be offered less than that."
