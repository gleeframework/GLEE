"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small lead, but I'll still get a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, even if it's a ""small lead"" for me. I'd like to try to negotiate further and aim for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so my offer will be adjusted accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 56-44 split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 56-44 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finally settle on a division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a compromise, 50-50 split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on my gain!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think a 50-50 split is a fair compromise, especially since the money is worth less and less with each round. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, hoping we can finally settle on a division and end the game."
