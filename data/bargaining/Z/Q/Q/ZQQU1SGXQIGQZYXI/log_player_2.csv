"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the advantage I have in this game. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I understand you have the advantage, but your previous offer was too low. This is a more reasonable split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the pot is shrinking. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, Alice's offer is the same as in Round 1, but now the value of her share has decreased due to inflation.  It's better for me to take the guaranteed $40 now than risk her offering even less in a future round."
