"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a straightforward and fair way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"

Round 2

# Bob's message: You rejected 50/50, so I'll offer you a slightly smaller share. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

I rejected the 50/50 split, so Bob is trying to take advantage of that. His offer is still a bit generous, but I'm not sure if I want to give him the upper hand.

```

```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Maybe I can get a better deal next round!"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob! I'll give you a bit more, but don't think you're getting off that easy!""

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive in his offers. With inflation taking a bigger hit on his share, I think I can do better than this.

```

I'll take the $1000 and leave Bob with the remaining $999,000. It's a small victory, but it's better than nothing!"
