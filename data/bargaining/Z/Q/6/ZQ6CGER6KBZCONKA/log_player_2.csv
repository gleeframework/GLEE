"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd rather try to get a better deal than accept 40% right off the bat. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor this time!""}\n\n###\nSince the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to get a bit more than half to make up for the loss in value. Hopefully, Alice will consider this a fair offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's split it 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nAlthough the money is worth less now, I still think I can get a better deal than 45%. Let's see what happens in the next round! Maybe Alice will be more willing to compromise as the value of the money decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split now.""}\n\n###\nSince the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get a bit more to compensate for the loss in value. I hope Alice will see this as a reasonable offer, given the circumstances!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nAt this point, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, splitting the money evenly seems like the best option. Further rounds would only decrease the value even more, so it's time to accept and move on!"
