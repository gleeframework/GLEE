"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me taking the larger share. Given the inflation rates, I believe this is a reasonable starting point. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a nod to the idea that we should strive for a mutually beneficial agreement, while also acknowledging that the inflation rates will affect our decisions in subsequent rounds. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round.  Think about the future value of our shares! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation rates, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I think Bob will be more eager to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I'll try to use this to my advantage in the next round. Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept this deal. Given the increasing impact of inflation, I believe this offer is reasonable and might be more appealing to Bob than taking a chance on further negotiations. Your turn, Bob!"
