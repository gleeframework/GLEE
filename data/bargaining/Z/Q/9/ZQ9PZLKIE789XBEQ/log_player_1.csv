"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal for both of us.  
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Nice try, Bob!

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not split it evenly, since I'm the one who has to deal with inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn now. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You can have 450,000, I'll take the rest. It's a good deal for both of us!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 500,000, but don't expect me to go any higher!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive now, since I'm still dealing with inflation."
