"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept this and we can call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'll reject this offer.  While it's a decent amount, I can potentially get more in future rounds. I'll try to negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal for both of us. ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you 500000, but don't expect me to go any higher! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept this offer.  While I would have preferred more, the inflation is starting to impact the value of the money.  It's a fair split, and it's better to take it than risk getting nothing."
