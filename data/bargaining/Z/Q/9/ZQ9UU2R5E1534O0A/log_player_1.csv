"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, even accounting for inflation. I'm not going to accept that. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to propose a compromise offer, giving Bob a slightly larger share than my initial proposal but still keeping a significant portion for myself.  We'll see if he's more willing to accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though inflation has taken a serious toll on the value of the money, Bob's offer is still better than the 75/25 split I proposed in the previous round. It's not a great deal, but it's something. I'm accepting."
