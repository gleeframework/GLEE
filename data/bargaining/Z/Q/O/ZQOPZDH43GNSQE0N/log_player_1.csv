"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking. If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is worth 32% of the original $100.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

I'm proposing that I get 45% of the initial $100, which is $45, and Bob gets 55%, which is $55."
