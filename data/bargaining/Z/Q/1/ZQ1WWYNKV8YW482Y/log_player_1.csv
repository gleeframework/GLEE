"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8000 from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $7200. Now, I have to consider Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: 1000 (which is 10% of the current value of $10,000)
* Bob gain: 9000

This offer is not as good as my initial offer, considering the inflation. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the current value of $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
