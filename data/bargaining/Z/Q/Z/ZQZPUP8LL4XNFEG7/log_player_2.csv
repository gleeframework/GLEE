"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's adjust fairly. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Compromising, but inflation is severe on my end. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging inflation, she's still heavily benefiting from the deal.  Time is working against her far more than me. It's unlikely she'll get a better offer from me in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting both of us.  This is a compromise to end this before it gets worse.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm offering a slight concession from my previous 50/50 offer to show willingness to negotiate.
* **Time Pressure:** Alice needs to understand that time is running out. Each round makes the potential gains less appealing, especially for her. 
* **Maintaining Advantage:**  While I'm conceding, I'm still aiming for a slightly larger share, capitalizing on the fact that inflation is hurting her more."
