"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80, you take 20. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering a relatively small amount to Bob to see if he'll accept a quick and easy deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of the money, but I'll let you have a small share. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. I'd rather not take 10$ if I can get more. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 90% of the original amount, which is $90. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you take 40. It's a fair split considering the reduced value of the money.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small amount to keep negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking 15$ when I could potentially get more. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting even less in the next round. I'll accept this offer to keep negotiating.
