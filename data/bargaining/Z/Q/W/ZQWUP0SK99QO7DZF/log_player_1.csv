Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to accept a small amount in the first round.  This will give me a sense of his risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly more risk-averse than I expected. He's willing to risk losing more in the next round to get a larger share. I'll continue to try and push for a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping a larger share for myself. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in getting something now, rather than risking getting nothing in the next round."
