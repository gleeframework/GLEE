Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but this factors in the inflation over time. This offer is better for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the game's current state and the impact of inflation on both players' gains.
We are in Round 3 of the game. In each round, the value of the money decreases due to inflation - by 10% for Alice and by 5% for Bob. This means that with each round, the actual value of the money offered decreases, but at different rates for each player.

### Step 2: Calculate the effective value of the money for both players in Round 3.
For Alice, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, which means it's worth 90% of what it was in Round 2. For Bob, it's worth 5% less, or 95% of what it was in Round 2. Given that we started with $1,000,000, we adjust the values accordingly for each round's offers.

### Step 3: Consider the previous offers and the rationale behind them.
In Round 1, Alice proposed a 55% to 45% split, emphasizing fairness. Bob rejected this offer. In Round 2, Bob offered a 47.5% to 52.5% split, suggesting it accounted for inflation and was better in the long run. Alice rejected this offer.

### Step 4: Determine the strategy for Round 3.
Given the decreasing value of money and the previous rejections, Alice needs to balance between getting a fair share and considering the impact of further inflation. Since Alice's money value decreases faster, there's an incentive to settle sooner rather than later. However, the offer needs to be attractive enough for Bob to accept, given his more gradual loss to inflation.

### Step 5: Calculate the offer for Round 3.
Considering the faster depreciation of the money's value for Alice and the need to make an attractive offer, a slight adjustment from the previous offers is necessary. Aiming for a middle ground that acknowledges Bob's concerns about inflation but also tries to maximize Alice's gain is crucial.

### Step 6: Formulate the offer and message for Round 3.
Given the considerations above, Alice might adjust her offer slightly from the initial 55% but not go as low as Bob's suggested 47.5% for her share. A possible offer could be closer to a 50% split but slightly adjusted to account for the differing inflation impacts. The message should emphasize the compromise and the mutual benefit of accepting the offer given the ongoing inflation.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meeting halfway considering inflation""}"
