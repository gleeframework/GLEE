"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $100, which is $80, and leaving Bob with 20%, which is $20. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his own proposal in the next round."
