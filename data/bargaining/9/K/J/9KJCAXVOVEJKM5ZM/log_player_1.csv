"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering you $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth less, so I'll aim to get a higher share. I'll reject this offer.

```

}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a higher share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."
