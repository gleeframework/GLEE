I'm going for a very aggressive opening offer.  I'm confident that Bob will want to keep playing, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer and I'm not sure I can do better. I'd rather take the 50 now than risk getting nothing."
