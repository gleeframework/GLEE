"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While a 40/60 split seems unfair at first glance, I need to consider the long game and the impact of inflation on my potential earnings. If I reject this offer, I have a chance to propose a more favorable split in the next round, where I'll have more leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer accounts for the time value of money.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** I need to secure a larger share than Alice to offset the 10% inflation that will eat into my earnings in subsequent rounds.
* **Strong Opening:** A 55/45 split in my favor is a strong opening offer. It signals that I understand the game's dynamics and am not willing to settle for an unfair deal. 
* **Negotiation Tactic:** By using the phrase ""Let's be reasonable,"" I'm framing my offer as a logical and fair compromise, potentially making it more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, considering inflation is on my side 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is becoming critical. Let's analyze why accepting is now the best course of action:

* **Severe Inflation:** The 19% inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. Each round of rejection makes a substantial difference.
* **Downward Trend:**  Alice's offer has worsened from 6000 to 5800, and it's unlikely she'll drastically improve it in future rounds. Her message implies she's aware of her advantageous position.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting now in the hopes of getting a slightly better deal later (e.g., 4500) is too risky. The inflation could erode any potential gains, leaving me with even less in the next round.

While not ideal, accepting 4200 now guarantees a reasonable sum considering the circumstances. Rejecting carries a significant risk of ending up with even less."
