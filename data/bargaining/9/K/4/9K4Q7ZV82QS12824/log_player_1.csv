"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start by being generous and offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept quickly.  This minimizes the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the risk of further inflation makes this a reasonable offer.  It's better to secure a decent portion of the money now than risk getting nothing at all."
