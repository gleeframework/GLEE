# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth 20% less to me with each passing round, I'll try to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nHere's my offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It's time to split it evenly. We both lose value with each round, so let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 36% less to me now, I need to consider the reduced value. Alice's offer of an even split might seem fair at first glance, but considering the inflation impact, I think I can still try to negotiate a slightly better deal.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","In this round, I'll consider the impact of inflation on both of us. Since the money is worth 36% less to me and 19% less to Alice, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.\n\n###\n\nHere's my new offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact on both of us, I think this is a reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement soon."
