"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k and take 600k.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I get a slight edge since I'm the first to make the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve more for being the one who made the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me by making a higher offer after rejecting my initial one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me 30% less than what I initially proposed, especially since the value of money is already decreasing due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and considering Bob's last offer, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You think you deserve more for making the first offer? I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not going to let you take advantage of me.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not going to take advantage of me, but I'm not going to be generous either. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is really trying to squeeze me now! The value of my potential gain has decreased significantly due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me a paltry 10% of the original amount, especially when the value of that amount is already worth so much less due to inflation. I'll try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I need to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not going to give me a good deal, so I'll have to take a bit more for myself. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, so I'll give you a tiny share. Don't expect any more generosity from me. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting ridiculous! The value of my potential gain is decreasing dramatically due to inflation, and Bob is still trying to take advantage of me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me a mere 0.5% of the original amount, especially when it's worth so much less due to inflation. I'll try to make one last stand and hope Bob gets desperate enough to make a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my last chance to make a good deal. The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to make a bold move.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm taking what I want, and I'm not going to let you take advantage of me anymore.""
}
```

I'm going all-in on this one. I'll take a significant share, but at least I'll get something worth something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take it all. You've had your chance to negotiate, now it's my turn to make the final decision. 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's a take-it-or-leave-it situation. I don't have any other options left.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd rather walk away with nothing than let Bob take the entire amount. It's a principled decision, but I'm not sure it's the most practical one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I've already rejected Bob's offer, and now I'm left with nothing. I have no choice but to make a final, desperate offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 0,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000000,
  ""message"": ""I have no other choice. You win. Take it all.""
}
```

I'm essentially surrendering. I'd rather Bob takes the entire amount than continue to negotiate further."
