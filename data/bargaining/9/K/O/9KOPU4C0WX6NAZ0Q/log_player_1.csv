"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a first round. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $1900.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a better offer than the 60-40 split he rejected earlier.
