"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the majority, but I'll still give you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's a bit risky to accept this offer right away, especially considering the inflation.  I'd rather see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm willing to give you a good share.  This offer is fair and will give us both a nice chunk of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to take a little less, but I still need a fair share. This offer is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, inflation is a serious factor.  This offer is better than what I offered and still provides a decent amount of money.  It's a good compromise."
