"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this as a sign of good faith. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a generous offer from Alice, it's worth considering the inflation factor. Even though it seems like a good deal now, waiting and making a counter-offer could potentially result in a much larger share of the money for Bob in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I believe a more equitable split is fair.  Let's see if we can find common ground.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split the difference from the last round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic choice. The inflation rate will continue to devalue my share in future rounds, and there is no guarantee that Alice will offer a better deal.  The 4000$ is a decent gain, and securing it now avoids further risk."
