I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty generous offer, considering I'm taking the risk of Bob rejecting it."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option considering the time we're running out of.  If Bob doesn't accept, we'll both get nothing, and he's going to lose more due to inflation than me. Let's hope he comes to his senses."
