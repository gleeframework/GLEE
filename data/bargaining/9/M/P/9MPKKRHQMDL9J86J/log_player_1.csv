I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I want to take a larger share."

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a significant share, but I am willing to concede some of my initial demand to avoid losing more money due to inflation."

While I'm still disappointed with the split, I'm realizing that the inflation is eating away at both of our potential gains. Accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing at all."
