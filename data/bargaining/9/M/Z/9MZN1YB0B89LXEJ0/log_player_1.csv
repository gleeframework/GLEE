"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $450,000.

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle yet. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to regain the upper hand.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, taking a larger share of the money. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Let me calculate the actual value of my proposed gain in round 3, considering the inflation:
$700,000 * 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = $507,900

Now, considering the offer from Bob in round 4, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take Bob's offer of $450,000. It's not as good as my original offer, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going to round 5."
