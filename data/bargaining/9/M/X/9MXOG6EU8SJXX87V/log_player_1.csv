"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer is a good starting point. It's a fair offer, and it gives Bob a small amount to encourage him to accept it. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm trying to minimize the risk of him rejecting my offer and us getting nothing in the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Bob has taken advantage of the inflation to drastically shift the offer in his favor. I still believe that we can reach a more equitable division, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can find a better compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to propose a more even split this time.  While Bob got a good deal last round,  I think this offers a fairer division and gives us both a decent amount. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept before the inflation eats away at both our gains."
