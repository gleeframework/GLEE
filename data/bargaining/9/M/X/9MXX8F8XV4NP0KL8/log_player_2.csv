Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I think we can do better. Let's split it 55/45.  This is still a fair deal, and it gives us both a chance to get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is presented as fair, time is working against me due to inflation. Accepting now means I'm losing a significant chunk of the potential value compared to the first round. I need to push for a better split while it's still worth my while."
