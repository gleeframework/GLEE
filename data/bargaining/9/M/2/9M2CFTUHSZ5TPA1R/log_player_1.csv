"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

I'm offering Bob 45% of the total amount, which I think is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 552500,
  ""bob_gain"": 447500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more""
}


Since Bob's money is worth 10% less now (5% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), I'll try to take a bit more for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
