I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor. Since the money is worth less to Bob each round, I want to maximize my share early on.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it might seem tempting to take a small share now, the money I gain is worth significantly less than in the previous round due to the 20% inflation.  It's better to wait and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to lower my share slightly, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  Since I'm the one proposing, I want to maintain some control over the split. I think a 70/30 split is fair considering the inflation that is impacting us both."
