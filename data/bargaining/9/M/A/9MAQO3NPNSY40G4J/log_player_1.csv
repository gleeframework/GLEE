I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer, but I figure it's best to be greedy early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it would have been nice to keep more of the money, the inflation is making the next round riskier.  I'd rather take the 75% now and be sure of a good deal."
