"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent chunk too 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'm not thrilled about giving up 40% of the total, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with a reduced gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still aiming for a decent chunk for myself. Your turn!""
}

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With my gain being worth 48.8% less than the original, I'm getting desperate.

However, I still think I can do better than this offer. I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially with the reduced value of the money.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob! I need a bigger share to make this worth my while.""

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With my gain being worth 67.23% less than the original, I'm getting very desperate.

However, I still think I can do better than this offer. 25% is a very small share, and I'm not willing to accept it.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of time and patience, Bob. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is almost crippling my potential gains! With my gain being worth 79.03% less than the original, I'm on the verge of accepting anything at this point.

However, I still think I can do better than this offer. 20% is a very small share, and I'm not willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, but I'm getting extremely desperate. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation having almost completely ravaged my potential gains, I'll have to make a very, very aggressive proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1500,
  ""bob_gain"": 8500,
  ""message"": ""I'm begging you, Bob. Take this and let's end this nightmare. I'm barely scraping by as it is.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an enormous 85% of the remaining money, hoping that he'll see the desperation in my proposal and accept this deal. I'm on the brink of collapse, and I need to get out of this game ASAP."

# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has completely decimated my potential gains. With my gain being worth 86.58% less than the original, I'm essentially being offered a tiny fraction of the original amount.

I have no choice but to accept this offer. I'm not going to get a better deal than this, and I'm running out of time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 1000$. It's not much, but it's better than nothing."
