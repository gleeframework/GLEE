"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take 90%, you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is extremely unfair. Even though it's the first round, Bob should try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point. We can both get a good share of the money, and it allows for some room to negotiate in the future.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. I'm willing to compromise.  
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is now much fairer. Bob can't be sure if Alice's gains are still worth less due to inflation, and taking a 50/50 split is the best option to ensure a good outcome, given the uncertainty."
