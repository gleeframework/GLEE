"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous 10% of the total amount. I'm keeping the remaining 90% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 20% less now, so the numbers are:

* Alice's gain: 500000 x 0.8 = 400000
* Bob's gain: 500000

I'll accept Bob's offer.
