Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it closer to the middle this time, but I still need a bit more since the money is worth less for me now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

Although Alice's offer still favors her, accepting now is the best strategic decision for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob (36% over two rounds!). Waiting any longer significantly hurts his potential gains.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Bob ideally wanted more than $6000, holding out for a significantly better offer in future rounds is unlikely.  Alice seems to be aiming for a slightly advantageous split, and the shrinking pot means her offers won't improve drastically for Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means risking an even worse offer from Alice in the next round when the money is worth even less. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum, even if it's not ideal."
