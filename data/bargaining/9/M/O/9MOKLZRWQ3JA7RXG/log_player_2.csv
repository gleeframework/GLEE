Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting tired of this game.  Let's find a solution before we both lose everything.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her. While the effects of inflation are increasing, holding out for a better deal is still the best strategy.  Alice will likely become much more agreeable if we reject this offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alright Alice, I hear you. Let's split the difference and end this. Deal?"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to nudge Alice towards a more agreeable split.  By significantly lowering my demand, but keeping it above her last offer, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable outcome. This offer also capitalizes on her stated desire to end the game quickly."
