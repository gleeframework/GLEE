```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""

```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"

# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent share! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 40. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 3

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller edge, but I'm still trying to get the better deal! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money I gain in this round being worth only 72.9% of its original value (100 - 27.1 = 72.9), I'm not sure if 48 is a good enough deal for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice! You're going to have to do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the value of the money now! With the money I gain in this round being worth only 59.05% of its original value (100 - 40.95 = 59.05), I'm not sure if 45 is a good enough deal for me.

However, I don't want to risk going into further rounds with the value of the money continuing to erode. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
