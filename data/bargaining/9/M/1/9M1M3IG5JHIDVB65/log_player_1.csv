"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm starting with a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth less than 50, so I'm losing out in real terms. But it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
