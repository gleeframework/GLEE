"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, $450,000 is equivalent to $360,000 in the first round's value. And since Bob's gain is worth 5% less, $550,000 is equivalent to $522,500 in the first round's value.

I think I'll take this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
