"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money.  I'm hoping this will make him feel like he's getting a decent deal and he'll accept it. I'm confident that I'll be able to get a better deal for myself in the next round if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. It's far too unfavorable to me. Even with the inflation, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, hoping to entice him to accept.  The inflation has made the money worth less for both of us, so I'm willing to give him more to get this done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. The inflation has hurt his offer significantly, and I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher percentage this time, hoping to incentivize him to accept. The inflation has made the money worth less for both of us, but I'm still confident I can get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  The inflation has really hurt his offer, and I'm sure I can get a better deal if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a smaller share this time, hoping to capitalize on the continued inflation and his diminishing gains. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While the inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly, Bob's offer is still better than what I've been getting, and it's unlikely he'll offer me more.  It's time to end this game."
