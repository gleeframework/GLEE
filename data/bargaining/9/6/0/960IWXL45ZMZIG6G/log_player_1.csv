"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I would only get $200,000, which is a significant decrease from the initial proposal. I'd like to make a new proposal to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm proposing that I get $400,000 and Bob gets $600,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the initial 50/50 split, but still gives Bob a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, I want the majority of the money 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I would only get a tiny $100,000, which is an unacceptable share. I'm starting to feel like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get a disproportionate share of the money. I'd like to make another proposal to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still need a decent chunk""}

I'm proposing that I get $300,000 and Bob gets $700,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that gives Bob a larger share, but still gives me a significant portion of the money."
