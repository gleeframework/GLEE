"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  I believe this split reflects the fact that we are both losing money over time, but the impact on me is larger. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. With the inflation, the money is worth less for both of us, but more so for Alice. I'll try to use this to my advantage."

# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the money is worth less for both of us due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better offer. Alice is losing more value than I am, so I'll try to use this as leverage to get a more favorable split in the next round."

# Alice gain: 580000
