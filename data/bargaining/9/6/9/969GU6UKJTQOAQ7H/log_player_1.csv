I propose taking 900,000 dollars and giving Bob 100,000 dollars.  I figure this is a fair starting point since I'm the one who's losing money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but still giving Bob a significant amount.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to maximize what I can get before inflation eats away at my gains too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Bob is still being greedy.  I'll try to negotiate something better in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm taking a bigger risk here by lowering my share further, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both losing money with every passing round, and that it's in our best interest to reach an agreement soon.  I'm willing to give him a larger share this time, but I'm still trying to ensure I get a reasonable portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this offer.  I know the clock is ticking, but I'm not willing to settle for a deal that gives Bob a huge advantage.  I'll try to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

We're getting down to the wire here.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, but I'm still willing to compromise.  This is my final offer - if Bob rejects it, we'll both be left with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm frustrated, but I won't give in to Bob's greed.  I'm still hoping we can reach a reasonable agreement, but I'm not going to be completely taken advantage of."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option left given the circumstances and the fact that we're both losing money.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in our best interest to finally reach a compromise."
