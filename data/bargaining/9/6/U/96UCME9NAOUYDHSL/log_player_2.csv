"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal Bob. I take $60, you take $40. It's a good deal for you to take now before inflation eats away at your share! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what happens with a little more bargaining!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'll take $55, and you can have $45. It's a fair compromise, and we can avoid further inflation eating away at the money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is decreasing with every round.  I'll take $55, you take $45. Let's wrap this up before it shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the $45. It's better than losing more money to inflation."
