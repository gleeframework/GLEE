Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  I figure he'll be happy to accept and we can both move on with our lives.  Since the money is worth 0% less each round, there's no incentive to wait and see how the inflation affects him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a significant improvement over the last offer.  While I'm only getting 100,000, it's still a lot of money. Since the inflation is only affecting Bob's gains, there's no point in holding out for a better offer."
