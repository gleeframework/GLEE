Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The inflation will only hurt us both further, and this is a fair split."
