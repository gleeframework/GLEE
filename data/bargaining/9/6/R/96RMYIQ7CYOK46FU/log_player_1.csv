"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll think about it and come up with a new offer for the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll! With the money being worth 20% less each round, I need to adjust my strategy.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
