Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this inflation is no joke. I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 in your favor is too much. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
