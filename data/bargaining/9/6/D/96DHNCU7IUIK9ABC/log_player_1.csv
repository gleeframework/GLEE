"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
``` 
 
I propose to keep 99% of the money and give Bob 1%. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to cooperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount of money.  Since the inflation hurts me more than Bob, it's better to secure a good deal now."
