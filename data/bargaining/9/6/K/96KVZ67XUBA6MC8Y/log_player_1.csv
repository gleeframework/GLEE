Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that gives me a larger share.  After all, it's my proposal first!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to take the 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing.  Inflation will only hurt Bob more in the coming rounds, making him more likely to accept a deal that favors me."
