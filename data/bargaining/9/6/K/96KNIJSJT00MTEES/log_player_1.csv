"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a generous offer, hoping he'll accept it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not being too generous just yet. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, he's keeping a larger share than he was initially, but I'm still getting a decent amount. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more attractive offer this time. Since Bob's offer was for 70% of the remaining money, I'll try to counter that by offering a smaller share to him.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and we can both get a good deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging too much, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still holding out for a larger share. I'll have to consider whether this offer is better than my previous one.
