"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with that split, Bob. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less in the previous round, and another 5% less this round), I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's try to find a fair split.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering a slightly more generous split, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
