"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, I'll take 60.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer for me to get 60, since you get a better deal with the inflation.  Let's split it this way! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think that's a fair offer, considering the inflation rates. Since the money is worth less for me due to 20% inflation, I should get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

I reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% inflation that affects my gains, I'll make a new offer to account for the decrease in value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll offer a slightly lower share for myself. Let's split it this way!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
