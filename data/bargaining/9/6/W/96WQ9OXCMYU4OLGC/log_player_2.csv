"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the majority, but I'm still giving you a decent share. Accept this and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to accept a quick $100,000,  it's too early in the game.  There's a chance for a better deal, and the inflation factor could make accepting a small share now a bad decision in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest and simplest way to go. We both get a good share without risking losing everything to inflation.""
