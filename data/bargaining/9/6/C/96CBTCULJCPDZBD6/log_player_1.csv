Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I think it's time for a more even split. Let's go with 55 for me and 45 for you.  This way, we both benefit from the remaining money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
