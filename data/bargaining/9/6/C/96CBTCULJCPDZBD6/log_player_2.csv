Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a more even split, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better share to account for the inflation.  Let's split it 60/40.  We both get a good amount, and I'm taking into account the devaluation of my share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
