"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the equivalent value in the first round. 

In the first round, my proposed gain was $500,000. With 20% inflation, that's equivalent to $400,000 in the second round. 

Bob's offer is $450,000, which is more than the equivalent value of my original proposal, so I'll accept this offer.
