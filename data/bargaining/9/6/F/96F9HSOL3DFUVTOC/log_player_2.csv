"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation that affects you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this seems like a fair offer, I'm aware of the inflation. I'll try to hold out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. With inflation, I'm sure you'll agree that's the fairest option for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Each round, your potential gain is worth less due to inflation. I'm adjusting my offer accordingly. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though it's a worse deal than the first round, the inflation is hitting me hard. Accepting this offer means I'll still get something, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
