"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a division where I take $5500 and Bob takes $4500, with a message suggesting a fair division. This is a starting point that slightly favors me but is still relatively balanced, considering we both want to walk away with something. Bob's turn! \n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice.  It's a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer to split the money evenly because, considering the inflation, accepting $5000 now is less valuable than what I initially offered to take ($5500), and I believe we can negotiate further. Plus, since Bob is affected more by inflation, waiting might put more pressure on him to concede more in the next rounds. Let's see what happens next! \n\n###"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, my offer now slightly increases my share to $5800, while Bob's share decreases to $4200. My message points out the need to adjust our offers due to the devaluing money, aiming to press Bob a bit more due to his higher inflation rate. \n\n###"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try this again.  I'm willing to take a slight hit to ensure we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his willingness to take a slight hit, the amount he's offering me ($4500) is significantly less than what I initially offered to take ($5500) and also less than what I offered in the last round ($5800). Considering the inflation impact, accepting this offer would mean I'm settling for a much lower value than I could potentially get. Since Bob is more affected by inflation, I'll push for a better deal in the next rounds. \n\n###"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, let's be realistic""}\n\nI'm increasing my share to $6000 and decreasing Bob's to $4000, emphasizing in my message that inflation is taking a toll and we need to be realistic about the money's value. Given that Bob's inflation rate is higher, I'm trying to leverage this to my advantage, while still offering him a substantial amount to avoid walking away with nothing. \n\n###"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to get serious.  Inflation is going to make this worse for both of us if we keep rejecting.  Let's compromise and get something before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his call for compromise, the terms still favor him more than I'm comfortable with, especially given the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains. By this round, the money is worth considerably less than at the start, but the difference in our inflation rates means I have more to lose by settling too early. I'll continue to push for a better deal, hoping Bob's higher inflation rate will pressure him into conceding more in the following rounds. \n\n###"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Last chance for a good deal""}\n\nI'm slightly increasing my share to $6200 and decreasing Bob's to $3800, emphasizing in my message that this might be the last chance for a favorable deal. Given the escalating impact of inflation and the limited number of rounds left, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency, suggesting that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, the following rounds might result in even less favorable terms for him. The pressure of potentially walking away with nothing if we don't agree within the 12 rounds should also start to weigh on Bob's decision-making. \n\n###"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to go higher than before, but we need to close this deal before things get even worse. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even though he's framing it as going higher than before, the actual value of what he's offering ($3500) is significantly lower due to the severe impact of inflation by this round. The difference in our inflation rates continues to give me leverage, as Bob is losing value at a much higher rate. Given that we're more than halfway through the rounds and the money's value is plummeting, I'll continue to push for a better deal, hoping the pressure of the deadline and the increasing devaluation will force Bob to offer more favorable terms in the next rounds. \n\n###"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Inflation's hitting hard, last good offer""}\n\nI'm increasing my share to $6500 and decreasing Bob's to $3500, emphasizing in my message that this is likely the last offer where we can both walk away with something meaningful. Given the drastic impact of inflation by this round, especially on Bob's side, I'm trying to convey a sense of finality and urgency. The threat of walking away with nothing if we don't agree within the remaining rounds should be increasingly significant for Bob, potentially making him more willing to accept a less favorable deal than risk losing everything. \n\n###"

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting dangerously close to the end.  This is my final offer.  Take it, or we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his claim that it's his final offer and the threat of us both losing everything, accepting $3000 at this point would mean I'm settling for a significantly devalued amount compared to what we started with. Given the inflation rates, Bob is under more pressure than I am, and his ""final offer"" still tries to skew the distribution in his favor more than I'm willing to accept. With two rounds left, I'll push for a better deal, hoping the imminent deadline will finally force Bob to offer terms that are more balanced, considering the severe impact of inflation on both our potential gains. \n\n###"

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6800, ""bob_gain"": 3200, ""message"": ""Final chance, Bob. Inflation's almost worthless""}\n\nI'm increasing my share to $6800 and decreasing Bob's to $3200, emphasizing in my message that this is essentially our last chance to walk away with something before the money becomes nearly worthless due to inflation. The difference in our inflation rates has given me significant leverage by this point, and with the deadline looming, I'm making a strong push for the most favorable terms possible. Bob's higher inflation rate and the risk of losing everything should compel him to accept this offer, as the alternative is likely to be far worse for him in the final round. \n\n###"

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. It's either this or we both get nothing.  Think carefully. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven that this is the final round and the severe impact of inflation on the money's value, I'm accepting Bob's offer of $2500 for me and $7500 for him. Although the terms are not favorable, the alternative is walking away with nothing. Considering the drastic devaluation of the money, especially for Bob, his offer still represents a significant concession on his part, given the original amount we were negotiating over. At this point, securing something, even if it's less than I initially aimed for, is preferable to losing everything. \n\n###"
