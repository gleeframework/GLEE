"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money in a 65:35 ratio. This is fair considering the risk of inflation in the upcoming rounds. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60:40 split is more fair. We'll both get a good share, and we can avoid the risk of further inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's aim for a 57:43 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the decreasing value of money in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a bigger share, the inflation is a serious concern. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good amount and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
