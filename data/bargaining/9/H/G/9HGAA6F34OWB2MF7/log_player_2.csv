Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation rates. Let's agree on this and move on.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. A 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation we've both experienced. It's better than fighting over the scraps. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the inflation and the fact that we're both losing money with each round. It's better than risking getting nothing at all."
