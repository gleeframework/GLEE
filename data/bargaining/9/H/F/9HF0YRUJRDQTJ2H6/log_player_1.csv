I propose a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob.  Let's start with a generous offer, but be prepared to negotiate if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I propose a split of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for Bob. This is a more even split, and since the money is losing value with each round, it's in both of our best interests to come to an agreement."
