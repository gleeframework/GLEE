Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic bargaining game. Since I'm Alice, I'm going to start by proposing a deal that heavily favors me. I'm taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. 

I'm banking on the fact that Bob might be willing to accept this in the first round, rather than risk the possibility of getting nothing at all if we reach the final round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Inflation:** The money is worth 20% less for me this round, so my share is effectively only 40% of what it was in the first round.  
* **Fairness:**  Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a much fairer deal than my initial proposal.
* **Risk:**  Rejecting this offer means going to another round.  It's not clear how much inflation will affect Bob's gains, so he could propose something less favorable to me in the next round. It's also possible we'll run out of rounds and get nothing. 

It's better to take the 50/50 split now and secure a decent share of the money."
