"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to keep 90$ for myself and give 10$ to Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the inflation will hurt Bob more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option given the inflation and limited rounds.  We are both getting a fair share, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
