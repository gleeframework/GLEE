"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""

```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, which is a relatively even split. If Bob accepts, we can end the game here."

Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

Here's my response:
