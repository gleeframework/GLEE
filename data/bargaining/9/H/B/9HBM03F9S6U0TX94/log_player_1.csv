"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split and encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less for Bob, but still more for me.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a better deal for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for me. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Consider this a compromise.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and split it 50/50, let's end the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth significantly less for Bob, but still the same for me.

I'm intrigued by Bob's sudden willingness to split it 50/50. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a fair offer, and I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split. Let's end the game!"
