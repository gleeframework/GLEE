I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly.  I'm hoping to secure a good deal early on before the inflation kicks in.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to accept Bob's offer. While it's not as favorable as my initial proposal, the inflation would make any further rounds risky. With a 50/50 split, I'm guaranteed half of the remaining value, and the risk of getting nothing is eliminated."
