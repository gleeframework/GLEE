"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial offer of 8000$ for me and 2000$ for Bob doesn't seem as good anymore.

I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll take the higher share. I'll accept this offer.
