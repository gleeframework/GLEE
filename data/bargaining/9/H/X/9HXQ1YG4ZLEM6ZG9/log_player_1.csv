"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 20% and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice. Let's split it down the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to be more careful with my proposals. I don't want to be too greedy, but I also don't want to give up too much.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'll try to come up with a new proposal that's more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but with a slight bias towards me. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a decent chunk for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share for myself and being reasonable enough to make Bob accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my ideal, but I think I can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I need to be realistic about the value of the money at this point. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it exactly down the middle. I'm willing to compromise and give you an equal share.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more conciliatory and find a fair middle ground, considering the reduced value of the money."
