"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $55 and Bob will get $45. I'm being generous, but also making sure I get a bit more since I made the offer first. The message is a gentle nudge to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I don't see a reason to accept a lower amount than what I initially proposed. Plus, Bob's offer is just a reversal of my initial proposal, so I'll reject it and make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Come on, let's end this. You're losing value each round.""}\n\nSince Bob's money is worth 10% less each round, I'll try to take advantage of that and propose a slightly more uneven split. I'll take $60 and Bob will get $40. My message is a bit more urgent, trying to persuade Bob that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the value of his money decreases further. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal. Let's wrap it up before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I'll accept this offer. Although I was trying to get a better deal, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is reasonable, and I don't want to risk him proposing an even lower amount in the next round. Plus, his message seems sincere, so I'll accept this offer and we can wrap up the game.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
