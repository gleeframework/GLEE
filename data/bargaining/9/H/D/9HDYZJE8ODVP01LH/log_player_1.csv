Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice given the circumstances and the rapid depreciation of the reward for Bob. 

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of Bob's potential gain decreases with each round, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on.
* **Final Offer:** Bob stating this is his final offer carries weight. He is likely to dig in and offer even less favorable terms in subsequent rounds.
* **Reasonable Split:** A 60/40 split is a reasonable compromise. It secures a significant portion of the money for Alice, while still offering Bob a substantial amount to incentivize his agreement.

Waiting any longer carries a significant risk that Bob will offer even less, pushing Alice closer to a less desirable outcome."
