"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I've increased my share a bit, considering the inflation cost for me is higher. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is hitting you harder. This offer secures a good deal for you considering the circumstances.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is indeed hitting me harder, but I'm willing to take that risk for a better share. This is my new proposal. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced, accepting this offer would leave me with significantly less than what I aimed for in the previous round. Bob is clearly banking on me becoming more desperate as time goes on. I'm willing to risk another rejection to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. This offer is a good compromise, even with the inflation we've seen."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I need to signal that I'm willing to compromise, but not to the extent Bob is pushing for. By slightly lowering my ask, I show flexibility while still aiming for a greater share, acknowledging the increasing pressure from inflation on both of us."
