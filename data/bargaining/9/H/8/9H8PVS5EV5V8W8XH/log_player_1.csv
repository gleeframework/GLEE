"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep $900,000 and give Bob $100,000. 

This is a good starting point as it ensures I get the majority of the money while also offering Bob a small share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob's share is higher than my original offer, my share has been significantly reduced due to inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a better deal to compensate for the loss in value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose to keep $600,000 and give Bob $400,000. 

I'm willing to increase my offer slightly from the last round to incentivize Bob to accept. However, I still need a good amount to offset the inflation that has reduced my share. Let's see if this is a good enough compromise."
