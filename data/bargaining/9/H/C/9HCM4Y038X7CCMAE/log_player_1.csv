"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not 50/50 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my potential gain is now $4,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 40/60 split. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, my potential gain is now $3,600.

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will accept this compromise."

# Alice gain: 4800
