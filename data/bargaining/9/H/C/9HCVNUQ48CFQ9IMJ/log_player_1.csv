"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is a classic game theory problem, and I'm playing as Alice, aiming to maximize my gain. Since the money is worth less for me with each passing round, I want to get as much as possible as quickly as possible. I propose taking 99 dollars and leaving 1 dollar for Bob. This is a risky strategy, as Bob could reject it and force me to make a less favorable offer in the next round.  However, I'm banking on his greed and his desire to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money I'll receive is already 20% less than the previous round.  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will offer anything close to this in the next round.
* **Limited Rounds:** We only have 12 rounds, and with each round, my money loses value.  It's risky to keep rejecting offers hoping for a better one later. 
* **Bob's Position:** Bob has shown he's not afraid to reject an offer, meaning he likely has a strategy in mind.  It's better to secure 50% now than risk getting nothing later."
