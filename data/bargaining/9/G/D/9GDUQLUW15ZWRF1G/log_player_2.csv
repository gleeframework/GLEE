"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is ticking and we both lose with every round. This offer is a good compromise for both of us. Let's seal the deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's essential to remember that she loses money at a faster rate than I do.  Holding out for a better offer, even with the impact of inflation, is still strategically advantageous."
