"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a more balanced distribution to ensure we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $55 is now worth less than I initially thought. However, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now.
