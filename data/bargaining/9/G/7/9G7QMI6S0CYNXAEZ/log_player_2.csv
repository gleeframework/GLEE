Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Explanation:**

Even though the money Bob gains is worth less due to inflation, it's still more than what he would get if he rejected Alice's offer and continued to the next round. Here's why:

* **Round 3 vs. Round 4:** If Bob rejects this offer, he'll get to propose in Round 4. But his offer will be worth even less due to inflation (9.75% less from Round 3, meaning a total of 19.25% less than Round 1). 
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice likely understands the inflation effect on Bob and is taking advantage of it. She's willing to give Bob a slightly larger share in this round to avoid the risk of him getting a larger share in the following rounds.

By accepting, Bob ensures he gets a decent portion of the money and avoids the risk of losing even more in the future due to inflation."
