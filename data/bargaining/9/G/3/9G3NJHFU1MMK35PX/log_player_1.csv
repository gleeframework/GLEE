"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game's inflation mechanics. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll accept this offer to get a higher amount of money in the current round.
