"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get 10%, I get 90%.  We can work out a better deal for you in the future if you accept.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move a bit closer to your proposal, Bob. Let's try 65/35.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a fairer split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Given the faster rate of inflation for me, holding out for a better deal in the next few rounds is worth the risk."
