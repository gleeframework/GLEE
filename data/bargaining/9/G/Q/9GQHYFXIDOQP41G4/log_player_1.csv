"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both enjoy a nice dinner on me!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting my proposal and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair starting point for us to negotiate. Accept this, and we'll both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled with Bob's offer, as it seems quite one-sided. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying it, Bob. I'll do better than that.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob. This is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. We both know that the value of the money is decreasing. Accept this, and we can both get a decent share before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%).

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as it seems he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share. I'll reject his offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not again, Bob! I'm not falling for that trick. I'll do better than that.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 64.61% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1% - 9.29% = 64.61%, 9.29% is the cumulative inflation from round 1 to round 4).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 645000,
  ""bob_gain"": 355000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to get worried, Bob. Let's make a deal before it's too late.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking.  We're losing money rapidly.  Let's be practical and accept this deal before we both end up with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 355000 
# Bob gain: 645000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round (100% - 40.95% = 59.05%).

It seems like Bob is trying to make a similar offer to the one he made in round 4, but with the same numbers. I'll reject it again and make a new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, you're not getting it. I'm not falling for the same trick twice.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 33.51% of what it was in the first round (100% - 40.95% - 9.29% - 9.29% = 40.47% of 100% - 9.29% = 31.18%, 9.29% is the cumulative inflation from round 1 to round 6, but in round 6 I had 64.61% of the original amount, so I subtract 9.29% from that and then 9.29% from the remaining 64.61%, 31.18% * 1.1 = 34.30% is 10% less than 40.47% so I rounded to 33.51%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 333000,
  ""bob_gain"": 667000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. Meet me at 2/3 and let's end this.""
}
```"
