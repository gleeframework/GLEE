"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair initial offer, considering the inflation rates that will come into play in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 80% while still giving Bob a larger share than his initial offer. This should incentivize him to accept, as he'll receive more than his previous offer, and I'll still retain a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous offer, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm again reducing my share slightly, but Bob's inflation rate is now so high that his share is much lower than my previous offer. This should incentivize him to accept, as he'll receive more than his previous offer, and I'll still retain a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still less than what I offered in the previous round, his inflation rate is now extremely high. It's likely that if I reject this offer, his next offer will be even worse, and I'll end up with an even smaller share. It's time to accept a compromise."
