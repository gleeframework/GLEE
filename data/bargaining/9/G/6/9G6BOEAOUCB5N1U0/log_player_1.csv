"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering you 30 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 70 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of 40 dollars is worth 10% less than my original gain of 70 dollars, so I'm actually getting 0.9 * 70 = 63 dollars.

Bob's gain of 60 dollars is worth 5% less than his original gain of 30 dollars, so he's actually getting 0.95 * 30 = 28.5 dollars.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
