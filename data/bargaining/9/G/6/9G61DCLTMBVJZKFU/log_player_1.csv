"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to start with. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, let's see if we can get closer to an agreement 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'll have to be cautious. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a significant increase in his share. I'll think carefully before responding.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was a 50-50 split, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth 20% less. I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""You said you wanted fairness, but it looks like you're willing to take a smaller share. I'll give you a tiny bit, but I'm taking the lion's share this time.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share this time. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain even more significantly, I'll try to take advantage of the situation. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk pushing him too hard.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to make a more aggressive move, but not too extreme. I'll aim to get a better deal, but still be willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll try to take a larger share. However, I'll still be cautious not to be too greedy, as I don't know how much more Bob's gain will be affected by inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, but I'm still willing to give you a tiny bit. Don't expect any more mercy from me, though.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to make a last-ditch effort to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to get any more desperate, I'll give you the rest and just take what's left. It's not like I have a choice at this point. 
# Alice gain: 9000 
# Bob gain: 1000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain even more severely, I'll take a closer look at his offer. It seems like he's trying to surrender, but I'll still make sure to review the numbers carefully.

Wait a minute... This offer is actually very similar to my offer in Round 3, but with a slightly smaller amount for Bob. Considering the significant inflation that's occurred, I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to make one final push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation having a huge impact on Bob's gain, I'll try to take advantage of the situation and make a strong final offer. I'll aim to get as much as I can while still leaving Bob with a small amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9900,
  ""bob_gain"": 100,
  ""message"": ""You've had your chance to negotiate, now it's time to take what's left. Don't expect any more offers from me.""
}
```

This is my final offer, and I'm not leaving much for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept it or try to make a last-minute counteroffer."
