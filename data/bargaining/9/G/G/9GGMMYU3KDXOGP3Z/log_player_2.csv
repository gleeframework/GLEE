"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to split it fairly, I know the money is worth less to Alice in each round.  I'm going to try to see if I can get a better deal for myself by making a counter offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  I'm willing to give you 40, but I need 60 to make this worthwhile for me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still going to reject.  Even with the inflation, I can likely get a better deal than 48 in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up to 65, but I need more to make this worthwhile for me.  If we don't come to an agreement soon, the value of the money will keep dropping for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: 50-50 split, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, Alice's offer is reasonable given the inflation.  The money is worth less with each passing round, and it's better to get 50 now than risk getting nothing."
