"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share. This is more fair as you benefit from the unchanging value of your money while mine depreciates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
