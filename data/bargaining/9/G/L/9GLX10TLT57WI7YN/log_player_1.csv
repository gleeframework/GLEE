"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said we should split it fairly, but this is what you offered. Now it's my turn to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to call me out on my initial offer.

I'll accept his counteroffer. Here's my response:
