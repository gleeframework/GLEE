Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm already losing 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take the deal, Alice is losing more to inflation now and her offers are getting more reasonable."
