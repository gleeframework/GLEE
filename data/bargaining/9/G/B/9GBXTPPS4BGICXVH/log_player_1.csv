This is a tough spot. While frustrating, Bob is capitalizing on the fact the deal is worse for me each round.  If I reject this, I risk getting even less in the next round. It's better to take the guaranteed $4,000 (which is still significantly impacted by inflation) than gamble on a worse outcome."
