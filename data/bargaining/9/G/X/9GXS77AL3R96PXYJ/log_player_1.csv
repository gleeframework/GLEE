"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is worth 20% less, so I'd rather get a larger share now. I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
