"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but you get something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept getting only 10 dollars when I know there's a chance I can get more. Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split.  We both get a good amount and we can move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it closer to even, but I need a little more than 50% to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer ensures I get something. Inflation is a real threat, and with only 10 rounds left, it's risky to keep rejecting offers."
