Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you one last chance 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing significantly with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him. 
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows Bob is experiencing inflation and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better. She called Bob's bluff on his ""final offer,"" and her position seems strong.
* **Something is better than nothing:**  Rejecting this offer carries a massive risk that Bob ends up with nothing if they can't reach an agreement. 

It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting the current offer cuts Bob's losses."
