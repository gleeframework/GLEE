Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but not quite there 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While my potential gains are diminishing, accepting a deal heavily skewed in her favor isn't smart. I need to signal I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds to get a more reasonable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's be fair and split it evenly."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to draw a line in the sand. Offering an even split accomplishes a few things:

* **Signals fairness:**  Alice can't reasonably argue for a much larger share if I'm willing to go 50/50.
* **Highlights the risk:**  With each passing round, the potential gains for both of us are shrinking. This emphasizes the downside of holding out for too long. 
* **Simplifies negotiation:**  Moving forward from this point gets increasingly complex. A 50/50 split provides a clean benchmark."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my last offer 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a dangerous game, hoping I'll panic as the inflation eats into my potential gains. However, her offer is getting worse, not better! This signals that she likely doesn't have a strong alternative and is banking on my impatience. By rejecting this offer, I call her bluff and highlight the risks she's taking as well."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Alright, let's be practical. This is a compromise, take it before it's too late."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

A key shift in strategy is needed. While I want a fair deal, Alice's stubbornness means I need to make a concession to avoid walking away with nothing.  Offering 48/52 is a calculated risk:

* **Signals flexibility:** It shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate away from the 50/50 split, but not by much.
* **Still advantageous:** Even with inflation, 48% now is significantly better than risking zero in later rounds.
* **Time pressure:** The message emphasizes the shrinking pot, putting pressure on Alice to accept before the deal worsens for both of us."
