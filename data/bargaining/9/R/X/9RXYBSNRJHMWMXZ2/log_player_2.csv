Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game continues, the less Bob's share is worth due to inflation.  Waiting for a better offer is increasingly risky as each round significantly erodes his potential gains.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share and seems unwilling to budge significantly. 
* **Better Than Nothing:** Accepting 430,000 is better than risking another rejection and receiving an even lower offer, or potentially reaching a point where the deal is worth almost nothing for Bob. 

This situation highlights the importance of understanding the concept of the ""time value of money"" and how external factors (like inflation) can drastically influence negotiations."
