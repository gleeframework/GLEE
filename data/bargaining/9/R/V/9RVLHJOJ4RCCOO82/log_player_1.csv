"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for a long game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rates.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
