Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share. This way, we both get a bit more and avoid losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
