"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount, but don't get too comfortable!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm leaving you with a decent amount to keep you interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain in the second round as 70% of 20, which is 14.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not getting enough, even though it's a 50-50 split in terms of the amount I would gain in a non-inflationary scenario. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain in the third round is 70% of 14, which is 9.8. I'll round it down to 9 for simplicity.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9,
  ""bob_gain"": 91,
  ""message"": ""You're not budging, I'll take a tiny share, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing a very small share for myself, hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting the offer and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up, neither am I. Let's meet in the middle again. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain in the fourth round as 51.2% of 20, which is 10.24. I'll round it down to 10 for simplicity.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's a 50-50 split in terms of the amount I would gain in a non-inflationary scenario, and I'm not getting any younger (or richer) in this game."
