I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a significant share. I think Bob might be more willing to negotiate after rejecting my previous offer."
