Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but we need to act quickly. Let's split the difference from my last offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of the potential gains due to inflation. Alice is clearly trying to capitalize on the time pressure, but Bob still has some leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a fair split considering the time constraint and the impact of inflation on my end. Let's close the deal and avoid losing everything.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** With time running out, Bob needs to make a strong final push.  
* **Fairness Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""final offer"" aspect and reiterating the inflation disadvantage emphasizes fairness to Alice.
* **Slight Concession:**  Moving slightly closer to Alice's previous offer might make her more receptive.
* **Avoiding Loss Aversion:** Framing the outcome as ""losing everything"" if they don't agree appeals to loss aversion, a powerful psychological motivator."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: With so little time left, let's just split the money evenly. It's the fairest option now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is very high.
* **Inflation Impact:**  Continuing to hold out means Bob loses even more value due to inflation with each passing round. 
* **Fair Offer:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair. While Bob might have gotten more in earlier rounds,  the current circumstances make this the most logical choice to avoid a total loss."
