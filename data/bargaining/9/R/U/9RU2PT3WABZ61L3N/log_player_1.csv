**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is steadily decreasing for Bob. This means each round he's more likely to accept a less favorable deal. 
* **Potential Loss:** If I reject this offer, there's a good chance Bob will offer me even less in the next round, putting me in a worse position.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees me $4,000. Rejecting carries the risk of getting a worse offer later. 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the declining value of the money for Bob makes accepting this offer the safest option to guarantee a reasonable gain."
