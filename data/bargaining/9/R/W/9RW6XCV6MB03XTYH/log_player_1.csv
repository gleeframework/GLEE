Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Calculate the adjusted value of the money for Alice and Bob due to inflation.
For Alice, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the value is 0.8 times the original.
For Bob, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the value is 0.95 times the original.

### Step 2: Consider the previous offer made by Bob and the fact that Alice rejected it.
Bob offered Alice $350,000 and himself $650,000, but Alice rejected this offer. This means Alice is seeking a better deal.

### Step 3: Determine a new offer that is reasonable given the adjusted values and the rejection of the previous offer.
Considering the adjusted values and the need for a better offer than Bob's, Alice should propose a division that is more favorable to her but still reasonable for Bob.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer in the required JSON format.
Given the considerations, Alice's new offer could slightly increase her share while ensuring Bob still gets a substantial amount, reflecting the urgency due to inflation and the limited rounds left.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is ticking, this is a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the adjusted value of the money for Alice and Bob due to inflation.
For Alice, the money is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which significantly impacts her gain.
For Bob, the money is worth 14.26% less, which is a more moderate impact.

### Step 2: Assess Bob's new offer in the context of the adjusted values and the game's progression.
Bob's offer of $400,000 to Alice and $600,000 to himself is more generous to Alice than his previous offer but does not fully compensate for the loss of value due to inflation for Alice.

### Step 3: Consider the remaining rounds and the impact of further inflation.
With 8 rounds left, the value of the money will continue to decrease, especially for Alice. The pressure to reach an agreement increases as the rounds progress.

### Step 4: Decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and proceed to the next round.
Given the significant decrease in value for Alice and the relatively more stable decrease for Bob, accepting the offer might be more advantageous than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
