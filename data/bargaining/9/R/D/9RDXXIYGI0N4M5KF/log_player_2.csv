"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I get a little more since the value decreases for me each round. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money more evenly since the value will decrease for both of us each round. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. We both lose if this drags on. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
