Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money closer to 60/40. This is a more equitable split that I believe is better for both of us.   
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
