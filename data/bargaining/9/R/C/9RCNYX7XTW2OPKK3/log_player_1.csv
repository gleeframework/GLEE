Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose we take almost all the money, leaving Bob with a small amount. Since he's the one facing inflation, it's likely he'll accept anything rather than risk losing more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is a huge improvement from the last round, but I'm confident I can still get a better deal. I'll reject and see what he proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a slightly lower offer for Bob than his last offer, but still a large sum for him. Since the money is worth less for him each round, he's likely to accept this."
