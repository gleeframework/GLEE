"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself $900,000 and Bob $100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation, especially in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose an 80/20 split, giving myself $800,000 and Bob $200,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the increased inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer isn't ideal, the inflation is starting to drastically reduce the value of the money. It's likely that if I reject this, Bob will propose a 90/10 split in his favor next round, and I'll get a much lower payout. It's better to take the $200,000 now."
