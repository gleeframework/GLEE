"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a decent share""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the money, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not feeling generous yet 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 70% of the original $100 is $70, which is still $70.
Bob's gain: 30% of the original $100 is $30, but due to inflation, it's worth 95% of that, so $28.50.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair split""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept it."
