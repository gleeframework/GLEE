"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and take $600,000 for myself. I'm being generous, but I also want to make sure I get a good share. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him more likely to accept the offer.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn! Please let me know if he accepts or rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, so I'm proposing a counter-offer that gives you a significant sum while still allowing me a larger share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's counter-offer. Although he's offering me a significant sum, I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering that I was willing to give him $400,000 in the first round. I'm also aware that the money is worth 10% less to me now, so I need to take that into account when making my decision.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll make a new offer that takes into account the current situation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll offer Bob $450,000 and take $550,000 for myself. The message ""Let's meet in the middle!"" is an attempt to find a compromise and persuade Bob that this is a fair deal.\n\nHowever, I need to keep in mind that the money is worth 10% less to me in each round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn! Please let me know if he accepts or rejects the offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This offer is a good compromise, and closer to my previous proposal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, even though he's trying to frame it as a compromise. The money is worth 27.1% less to me now, so I need to take that into account when evaluating the offer. In reality, the $450,000 he's offering me is equivalent to approximately $327,900 in the first round, which is not enough for me.\n\nI'll make a new offer that takes into account the current situation and tries to find a better compromise.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Let's find a mutually beneficial deal!""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll offer Bob $480,000 and take $520,000 for myself. The message ""Let's find a mutually beneficial deal!"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of cooperation and find a compromise that works for both of us.\n\nHowever, I'm aware that the money is worth 27.1% less to me now, so I need to be careful not to give away too much. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal for myself and making an offer that Bob might accept.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn! Please let me know if he accepts or rejects the offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Let's find a mutually beneficial deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. This offer edges closer to a 50/50 split, but time is working against you more than me. I suggest we close the deal now. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the current situation, I think Bob's offer is reasonable. The money is worth 40.95% less to me now, so the $490,000 he's offering me is equivalent to approximately $290,000 in the first round. While it's not the best deal I could have gotten, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risk going further and potentially getting an even worse deal or nothing at all.\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
