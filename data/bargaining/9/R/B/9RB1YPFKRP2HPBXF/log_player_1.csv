"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since we only have 12 rounds, I want to secure as much of the money as possible before the inflation hits too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a decent outcome given the inflation and the limited number of rounds.  It's better than getting nothing!"
