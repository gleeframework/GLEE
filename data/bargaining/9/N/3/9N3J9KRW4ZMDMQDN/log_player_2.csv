Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is hitting me hard. We need to find a solution that works for both of us, and this split reflects that urgency. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but we're not out of time yet. It's worth holding out a little longer to see if we can get a better deal. While her perceived value of the money is plummeting, ours is decreasing at a slower rate.  We still have some leverage."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"":  ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

- **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on. Alice's share is losing value rapidly, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal.
- **Firm Stance:** By presenting this as a final offer, we create a sense of urgency and limit further negotiation. 
- **Favorable Split:** While still somewhat generous, this offer ensures we get a larger share reflecting the difference in our inflation rates.

It's a gamble, but the clock is ticking, and we need to force a decision."
