I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a good starting point, and I believe it's fair considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering a slightly more balanced 85/15 split, recognizing that the money is worth less now.  This is a fair compromise given the inflation, and I hope we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I'm willing to go down to a 75/25 split. The inflation is increasing significantly, so we need to find a compromise soon. This is my final offer before the money becomes worth even less."
