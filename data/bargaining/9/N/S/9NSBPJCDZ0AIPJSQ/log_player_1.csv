"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a generous offer considering the initial amount. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be fair, but I'm not giving up too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I need to take this into account when evaluating the offer.

Let's calculate the effective values:

My gain: $300,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $700,000 × 0.9 (10% less) = $630,000

Considering the effective values, I'd rather not accept this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too greedy, Bob!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that Bob's gain is worth 10% less with each round. Since Bob's gain in the previous round was $630,000, I'll aim to make a more balanced offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a fair middle ground!""
}
```

This offer should be more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of his gain due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values:

My gain: $450,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $550,000 × 0.723 (27.1% less) = $397,350

Considering the effective values, I think I can do better than this. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still a bit too high, Bob!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a sweet spot!""
}
```

This offer should be more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of his gain due to inflation."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it down the middle, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values:

My gain: $500,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $500,000 × 0.593 (40.95% less) = $296,500

Considering the effective values, I think this is a reasonable offer. Splitting it down the middle seems like a fair compromise, and it's a good opportunity to end the game.
