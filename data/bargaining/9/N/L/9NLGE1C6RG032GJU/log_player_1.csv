"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's call it 60/40, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $4,000 gain in this round is worth 90% of the original $5,000 I could have gotten in the first round, which is $4,500. Since Bob's gain is worth the same as in the first round, his $6,000 is equivalent to $6,000.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather aim for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to maximize my gain while taking into account that the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55% of the remaining value, a fair compromise?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which I believe is a reasonable compromise given the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. 55/45 seems like a fair split given the circumstances.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain in the first round was $5,000, and due to inflation, my gain in this round is 72.9% of that, which is $3,645.

Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round, $6,000.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is actually a good one. He's offering me $4,500, which is 62.5% of the original $7,200 value ($5,000 / 0.9091), which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'll accept this offer.
