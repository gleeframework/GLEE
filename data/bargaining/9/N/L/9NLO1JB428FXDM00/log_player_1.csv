"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority of the money, but still leave you with a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob, it seems!

I'll think about Bob's offer... Hmm, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I was hoping for a bigger share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer! Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a bigger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to account for the inflation. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give away too much more 
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

I'll think about Bob's offer... Hmm, it seems like Bob is still trying to keep a significant amount for himself. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'm getting desperate to get a better deal before the money becomes even less valuable.

I'll decide to reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going to take a bigger risk and ask for a bigger share. I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to get a better deal.""
}
```

I'm going back to my original offer from Round 1, but with the knowledge that the money is worth even less now."

I'll think about Bob's offer... Hmm, it seems like Bob is still trying to keep a significant amount for himself. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'm getting desperate to get a better deal before the money becomes almost worthless.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another offer! Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get as much as I can.

  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a huge risk, but I need to get a significant share to make this deal worthwhile. This is my last offer.""
