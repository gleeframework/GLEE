"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer if I get a bit more, since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's split it 60/40, and we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
