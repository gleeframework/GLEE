"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's worth negotiating for a better deal!  Even though the money is worth less with each round, a 60/40 split is still far from ideal.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think 55-45 is a fairer split.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can go down a bit, but 58-42 is my new limit 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to impact my potential gains significantly.  Taking 420,000 is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
