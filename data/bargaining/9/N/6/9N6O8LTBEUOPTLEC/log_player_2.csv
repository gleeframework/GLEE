**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to offer slightly more than half,  clearly banking on Bob's fear of inflation to force a bad deal. However, time is also working against Alice. As we get closer to the final rounds, her leverage diminishes.  Bob should hold out for a better offer, aiming for a more even split."
