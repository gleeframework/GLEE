"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This ensures we both get something, and incentivizes you to accept to avoid losing more in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{
