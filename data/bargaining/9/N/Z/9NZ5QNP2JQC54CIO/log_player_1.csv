I propose taking 90% of the money and leaving Bob with 10%. This leaves room for negotiation in the future, but gives me a significant head start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm going to try and split the money more evenly. I'm aware that each round inflation makes the money less valuable, so I'm willing to give up some of my share to secure a deal."
