"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. Fair and equal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money I gain is worth 80% of what it was in Round 1, so I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll have to accept it since it's a 50/50 split, and I don't want to risk going to Round 3 with even less valuable money.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
