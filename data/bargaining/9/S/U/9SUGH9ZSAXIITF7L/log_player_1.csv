"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going for a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'm offering Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's a significant improvement from my previous proposal, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  The inflation rate is likely to be a factor in Bob's future offers, so I'm willing to wait and see what he proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping that Bob will see it as a step in the right direction and be more willing to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm also trying to be realistic about the potential for inflation to impact Bob's future offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The inflation rate is clearly having a significant impact on Bob's gains, and I'm unlikely to get a better deal in the future.  While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to secure some profit than to risk getting nothing at all."
