6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I propose we start with a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation rate works against me more than you. Let's settle this quickly and avoid losing money.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. While the inflation affects you more, I'm taking the risk of a longer game. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits us both.",Bob,2,

5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a higher share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the faster inflation rate I face.  I'm proposing 56/44 - a slight compromise on my initial offer that still acknowledges the time pressure. Let's agree now and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still convinced we can find a better solution. I'm proposing a 58/42 split in my favor. This offer acknowledges the inflation we both face, while still allowing us to secure a decent share of the money. Let's work together to reach an agreement before we lose more.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but we're running out of time.  My offer of 52/48 is a serious compromise.  It gives you a larger share than my last offer while still reflecting the faster inflation I face. Let's be reasonable and close this deal before our shares shrink further.",Alice,5,
