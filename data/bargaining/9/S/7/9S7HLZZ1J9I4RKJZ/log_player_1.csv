"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still get the same amount as in the first round. But for Bob, the money is worth 5% less, so he's offering me a slightly larger share than in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for an even better deal. 

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer. Considering that Bob's offer in round 2 was 55-45, I'll try to get an even better deal for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob's offer is now a 50-50 split, but considering the inflation, the actual value of the money he's offering me is less than in the first round.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting a worse deal.
