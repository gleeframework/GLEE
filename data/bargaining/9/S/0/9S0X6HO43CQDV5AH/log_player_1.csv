"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation factor makes this a good deal. Accepting ensures I get a significant amount, and I don't know how the inflation is affecting Bob's side of the equation."
