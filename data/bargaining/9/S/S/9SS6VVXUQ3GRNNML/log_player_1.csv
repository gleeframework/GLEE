"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to consider this disparity.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 40-60, and the money is worth 10% less now, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. I'll try to get a better deal.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the increasing inflation, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Bob's offer is still slightly biased towards him, but I'll think it's a good opportunity to take a risk and try to get a better deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
