Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We both lose value each round, so a fair split is the best way to maximize our gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want an even split, but it's riskier for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my original offer to close this out. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
