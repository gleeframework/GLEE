"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively fair and generous offer, considering the inflation penalty he'll face if he rejects it. The message ""Let's be fair"" aims to appeal to his sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer is not acceptable to me. Although he has taken a hit from inflation, his proposed split still gives him the larger share, which I don't think is fair considering the initial amount and the fact that my share's value hasn't decreased. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal in the next round, trying to leverage the fact that his share will continue to lose value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob a slightly lower amount than before, taking into account the inflation penalty he's facing. I'll also try to make the offer more appealing by highlighting the benefits of accepting it now rather than risking further losses.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, let's settle""}\n\nI'm hoping that Bob will realize that the inflation penalty is only going to get worse and that accepting this offer is the best option for him. The message ""Inflation is biting, let's settle"" aims to drive this point home and encourage him to accept the offer."
