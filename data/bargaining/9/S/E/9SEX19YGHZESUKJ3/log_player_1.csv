"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, considering the inflation disadvantage you'll face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in round 2 is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the less favorable the outcome for Alice due to the 5% inflation per round. Waiting any longer significantly diminishes Alice's potential gains.
* **Bob's Offer:** A 50/50 split is fair in principle. Bob recognizes the impact of inflation on Alice and is using it as a negotiation tactic. However, waiting for a potentially better offer in round 3 is too risky. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting Bob's offer means gambling on Alice securing a substantially better deal in round 3. The potential gain from a risky round 3 offer might not outweigh the guaranteed 50% she can secure now. 

By accepting, Alice guarantees herself a reasonable amount, even if it isn't the slightly advantageous outcome she aimed for initially."
