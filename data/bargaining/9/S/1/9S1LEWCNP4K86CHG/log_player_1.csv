I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure most of the money right away!  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than what Bob offered in the first round, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, as I'm not losing any value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob 4000, which is a bit lower than his previous offer, but since he's losing 10% of the value each round, it might be tempting enough for him to accept. Let's see how it goes!"
