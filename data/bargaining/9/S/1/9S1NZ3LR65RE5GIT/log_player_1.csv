"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal if you accept now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000$, which is a generous share, but I'm keeping 6000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it was a fair split, but I'm not convinced. I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate!

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a significantly better deal, and I'm hoping to get an even better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, my offer is now worth even less than before!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more this round. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being a bit greedy, Alice. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my offer!

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've been negotiating for long enough, and Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable considering the reduced value of the money. I'll take it!"
