"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split that accounts for the inflation, let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 in Round 2 is actually worth 90% of what I would have gotten in Round 1 ($8,000). That's a reduction of 10% due to inflation.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the proposed split, especially since it's even more skewed towards Bob's gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 in Round 2 is worth 90% of what I would have gotten in Round 1 ($8,000), and my gain of $3,600 in Round 3 is worth 81% of what I would have gotten in Round 1 ($7,200). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm taking a bigger share this round. Your turn to decide!""
