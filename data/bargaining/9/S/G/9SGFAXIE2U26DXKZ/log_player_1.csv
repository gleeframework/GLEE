Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? This ensures we both get a decent share before inflation eats into it too much. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45

{

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  Any more stalling and inflation will hurt us both. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value decreases significantly. Waiting longer risks getting a much smaller share later.
* **Decent Offer:** While not ideal, a 50/50 split is fair and guarantees a reasonable payout considering the circumstances.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob seems increasingly insistent on a quick resolution. Pushing further might make him less agreeable in future rounds."
