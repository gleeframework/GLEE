"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer is based on the assumption that Bob is also rational and will prefer to get $1,000 than nothing.  However, I am aware of the inflation and will adjust my offers accordingly in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money.  Considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we continue, it's a good deal."
