"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, my gain would be 64 dollars (80 * 0.8) if I were to accept the offer. However, Bob's proposal is to split it evenly, which means I would get 50 dollars, which is less than I would get if I were to accept the previous offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). So, if I were to accept an offer, I would get 64 dollars (100 * 0.64).

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but still fair.""
}
```"
