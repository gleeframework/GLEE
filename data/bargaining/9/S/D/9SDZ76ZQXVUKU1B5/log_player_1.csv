"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to divide the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm not getting as much value as I would have liked.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to do better next time!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I'm still being fair""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my share! With my gains being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'm not in a strong bargaining position, and Bob's offer is still better than nothing.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
