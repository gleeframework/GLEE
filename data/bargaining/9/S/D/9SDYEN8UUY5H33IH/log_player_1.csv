"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% and leave 40% for Bob, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation you'll be facing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 10% less than what Bob is offering. I'd rather take the 40% now than risk waiting for a better offer and facing even more inflation.
