"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or decline."
