"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I take the lion's share, but you get a nice chunk to start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $100,000, it's better to see what Alice offers in the next round. The money will be worth less each time, but I can potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair starting point. It's a good deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference from the last round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is being stubborn, but I can get a better deal if I keep rejecting her offers. The money is worth less each round, but it's still worth negotiating for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  An even split is the fairest solution, and it avoids any further loss due to inflation.""}
