Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, this is a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While the offer is not great, the inflation is hurting me significantly. It's better to take something than risk losing even more in the next round."
