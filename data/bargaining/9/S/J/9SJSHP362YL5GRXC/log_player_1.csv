"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'd get $6,000 and Bob would get $4,000. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's start with a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'd get $5,000, which is still less than what I initially proposed. However, it's a more balanced split than my initial offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
