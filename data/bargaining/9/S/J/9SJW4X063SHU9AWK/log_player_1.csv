"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $200,000, and Bob will take $800,000."
