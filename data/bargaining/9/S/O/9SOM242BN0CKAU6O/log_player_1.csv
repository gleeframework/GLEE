"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and taking 60 dollars for myself. I've included a message to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer, emphasizing fairness while also taking a bit more for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split it closer to 50/50, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is trying to negotiate and is offering a split closer to 50/50, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less to me with each passing round, I'll try to make the most of the remaining rounds to secure a more favorable offer. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 43 dollars and taking 57 dollars for myself. In my message, I'm suggesting that we meet in the middle of our previous offers, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. Since the money is worth 10% less to me with each passing round, I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable solution before the value of the money decreases further. Let's see how Bob responds!"
