750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, your offer was tempting, but still not in our best interests long term.  This is my final offer. It accounts for the fact that the money will be worth significantly less for you if you wait any longer.  Let's be smart and end this here.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer.  You've rejected my previous offers, but the clock is ticking, and the money is rapidly losing value for me.  This is a fair split that reflects the time pressure we're both under. Let's be realistic and end this now.",Bob,4,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains, but time is literally money in this game, and it's disappearing quickly for you. This is my final offer - it's more than fair considering the circumstances. Let's settle this now and both come out ahead.",Alice,5,
