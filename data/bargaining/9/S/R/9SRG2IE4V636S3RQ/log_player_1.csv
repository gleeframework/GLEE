  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split seems fair, considering we're starting from scratch and the potential for inflation is unknown. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
