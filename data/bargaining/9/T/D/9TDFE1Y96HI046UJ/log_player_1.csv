```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can call it a day.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob nothing, and I'll take the whole $100. Of course, this is just a starting point, and I'm sure Bob will reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount, but I'm hoping to do better later on! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rates.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a bigger share to make up for it. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns!

Considering the inflation rates, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: $40 / (1 - 0.1426) = $40 / 0.8574 ≈ $46.64
Bob's gain: $60 / (1 - 0.271) = $60 / 0.729 ≈ $82.42
