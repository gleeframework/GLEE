Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 55 is actually worth 73.5% of the original 50 I would have gotten in round 1, and Alice's gain of 45 is worth 64.6% of the original 50 she would have gotten in round 1. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
