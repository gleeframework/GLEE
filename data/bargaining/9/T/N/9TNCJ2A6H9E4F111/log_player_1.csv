"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll take the risk of negotiating""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as taking the risk of negotiating, implying that I'm the one doing the heavy lifting and therefore deserve a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now!

Considering the new values, I'd rather not accept this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 48-52 is a fairer split for both of us""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the decreased value of the money and proposing a slightly more even split, with me getting $48 and Bob getting $52."
