"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share.  It's a fair deal, considering we both lose money each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n(I've decided to reject Bob's offer, considering the division and the impact of inflation on the money's value.)\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again!
