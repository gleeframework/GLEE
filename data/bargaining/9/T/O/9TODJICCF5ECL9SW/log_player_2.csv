"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's proposal seems fair, it's important to remember the inflation rates. Since the money is worth less for Bob in each round, it's better to hold out and see if Alice offers a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. But considering the inflation, I think it's only fair to split the money more evenly. Let's both get 60%.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share is already worth less. This is the most I can compromise. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, it's still not taking into account the full impact of inflation on both parties. Holding out for another round might lead to a better deal, especially as the money is worth less for Alice than it is for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice,  the inflation is hitting us both hard. I'm willing to compromise by offering you 45% of the money, but I need at least 55% to make this worthwhile for me. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value, but I've lost nearly half the original value. I need a bit more to make up for it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is more favorable to her, but it's important to consider the diminishing value of the money.  Since the money is worth less for Alice in each round, this offer is likely the best she'll make.  It's better to take what we can than risk getting nothing."
