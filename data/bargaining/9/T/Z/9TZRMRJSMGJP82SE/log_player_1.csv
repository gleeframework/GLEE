"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a gamble here, Alice.  If you refuse, I'll be in a better position next round, but I'm willing to share a good chunk of the money now to avoid that risk.  Let's work together. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
