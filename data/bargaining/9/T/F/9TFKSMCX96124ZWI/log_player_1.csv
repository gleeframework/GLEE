"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small portion, but it's a good starting point. I'm keeping the majority of the money, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 200000 x 0.8 = 160000
Bob gain: 800000 x 0.8 = 640000

I'm not happy with this offer. I think I deserve more than 160,000. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 600,000, which is a 50/50 split, but I'm still keeping a slight edge. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 400000 x 0.516 (since 1 - 0.488 = 0.512, but it's 48.8% less, so 1 - 0.512 = 0.488, but 1 - 0.488 = 0.512, 1 - 0.512 = 0.488 so it is 1 - 0.488 = 0.512, 1 / 0.512 = 1.953125 so 400000 * 0.512 = 204800, 400000 * 0.516 = 206400, so 400000 * 0.516 = 206400 * 0.8 = 165120)
Bob gain: 600000 x 0.8 = 480000

I'm not happy with this offer. I think I deserve more than 165,120. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 700,000, which is a 70/30 split, and I'm giving Bob a smaller share. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 50/50, but I think I deserve a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 6, the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 500000 x 0.332 (since 1 - 0.6723 = 0.3277, but 1 / 0.3277 = 3.0507, so 500000 * 0.332 = 166000)
Bob gain: 500000 x 0.8 = 400000

I'm not happy with this offer. I think a 50/50 split is a good idea, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that is even less favorable to me than the previous one. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55/45 split, which is closer to a 50/50 split, but still gives me a slight edge. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 8, the money is worth 79.03% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 450000 x 0.205 (since 1 - 0.7903 = 0.2097, but 1 / 0.2097 = 4.7746, so 450000 * 0.205 = 92250)
Bob gain: 550000 x 0.8 = 440000

I'm not happy with this offer. The actual amounts are even less favorable to me than before, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that is so skewed towards Bob. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's make it a 50/50 split, Bob. No more negotiating, let's settle!""
}
```

I'm going for a straight 50/50 split, no more trying to negotiate or get the better end of the deal. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and split the remaining money evenly."
