I propose to keep 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  It's a fair start, as I'm taking the larger share, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
``` 

I'm willing to go down to 720,000 for myself, but I need a bigger share than Bob offered in the last round. The inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, and I need to compensate."
