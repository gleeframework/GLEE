"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'm now considering a gain of $570,000 (600,000 * 0.95).

Bob's offer is a 70-30 split, which is indeed meeting me in the middle. I'm not sure if I should take it, but I'll have to think about it.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round, so I'm now considering a gain of $549,000 (600,000 * 0.91025).

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle. 55-45 split. Take it or leave it?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive now, as the money is decreasing in value with each round."
