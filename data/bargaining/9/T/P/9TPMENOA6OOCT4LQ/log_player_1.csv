"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 36 (60% of 60) and Bob's gain of 60 is now worth 58 (60% of 97.5).

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 36% of its original value for me, and I'm not sure what percentage it's worth for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, hoping he'll accept."
