"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away at it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Thank you for relaying Bob's offer. Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, his offer of $5,500 is actually worth less to him than the face value. However, I still think I can get a better deal.

My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting you, let's settle soon""
}


I'm taking into account the fact that inflation is reducing the value of the money for Bob, so I'm offering him a slightly smaller share this time. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is ridiculous Alice, let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  The longer this goes on, the less we both get! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","However, I notice that Bob's gain is actually worth 48.8% less than the face value due to inflation. This means that his $5,000 is actually worth much less to him than it would be to me.


My response is:


{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}


I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to take advantage of the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is killing your share, let's end this""
}


I'm increasing my share and decreasing Bob's share, taking into account the significant impact of inflation on his gain. I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, I'm willing to negotiate, but this needs to be realistic. Time is running out for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","However, considering the massive impact of inflation on Bob's gain (67.23% less than the original value), I believe I can still get a better deal.


My response is:


{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}


I'll try to make another counteroffer in the next round, taking advantage of the fact that Bob's gain is rapidly losing value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is crippling your share, accept before it's worthless""
}


I'm increasing my share again, while decreasing Bob's share, as the inflation effect is severely eroding the value of his gain. I'm hoping he'll realize that accepting this offer is better than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm accepting your initial offer to avoid getting nothing. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","However, I notice that this is actually the same offer I made in Round 1, and I've already seen that I can push for a better deal.


My response is:


{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}


I'll try to make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to squeeze out a bit more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, accept this or risk nothing""
}


I'm increasing my share again, while decreasing Bob's share, as the inflation effect is devastating the value of his gain. I'm hoping he'll realize that accepting this offer is the only way to salvage any value from the game."
