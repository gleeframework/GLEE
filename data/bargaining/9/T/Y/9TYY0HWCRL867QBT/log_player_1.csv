"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a bit more to invest and grow our combined wealth.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me taking $8,000 and Bob taking $2,000. My message to Bob is that I'm aiming for a fair split, but I want to take a bit more to invest and grow our combined wealth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I think we can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 6,000 x 0.9 = 5,400
Bob gain: 4,000 x 0.9 = 3,600

I'll reject this offer. The proposed split is still not in my favor, and I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking on the risk of investing our combined wealth.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me taking $7,000 and Bob taking $3,000. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking on the risk of investing our combined wealth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting close, let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 5,000 x 0.727 = 3,635
Bob gain: 5,000 x 0.727 = 3,635

I'll accept this offer. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to take the $3,635.
