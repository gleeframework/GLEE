"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the value of the money has decreased significantly.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 20% less than the original amount, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob, hoping he'll accept this time."
