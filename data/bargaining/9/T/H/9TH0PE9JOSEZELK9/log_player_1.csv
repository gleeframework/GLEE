"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of $4000, which is $3200, and Bob's gain of $6000 is now worth 95% of $6000, which is $5700.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems Bob is getting a larger share than I am, despite the inflation adjustment. I'll reject this offer.
