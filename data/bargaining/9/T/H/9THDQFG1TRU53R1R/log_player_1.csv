I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, it's important to consider the inflation. If I reject this offer, I'll have to make a proposal in the next round, and the money will be worth even less. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent share of the money, even with the inflation."
