"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This is a risky move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share in the first round. It's possible he might be more agreeable to a smaller cut early on, rather than waiting for the inflation to kick in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer means I get to make the proposal in the next round, and with the inflation affecting Bob's gains more than mine, I have more leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm raising my share slightly from the first round, but I'm still offering Bob a small amount. My hope is that he'll see the inflation affecting his gains more heavily and be willing to accept a smaller share to secure something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more reasonable, but I still think I can get a better deal. Inflation is hitting him harder, so I want to push my advantage in the next round by making another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm raising my share slightly again, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount.  I'm hoping the increased inflation pressure will motivate him to accept a deal before it gets even worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough call. Bob's offer is getting very close to being even.  But I'm still confident I can get a better deal. With the inflation hitting him harder, I believe I can secure a higher percentage for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm making a slight concession, reducing my share by 50,000, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion.  Inflation is taking a heavy toll on Bob, and I want to see if this is enough to convince him to accept before things get even more unfavorable for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough choice, as I'm getting a much lower share than I hoped for.  But the inflation is seriously hurting Bob, and I'm afraid if I keep rejecting, I might end up with nothing in the end. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount, even though it's not ideal."
