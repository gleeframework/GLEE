Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to get the majority of the money. Since I'm the one making the offer, I'm going to see how much I can get away with. Let's see if Bob is okay with a 90/10 split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I would prefer more, I'm taking a loss on the deal. If I reject, the next round I will only gain 320,000, making the deal worse for me. I'll take the 400,000 and run."
