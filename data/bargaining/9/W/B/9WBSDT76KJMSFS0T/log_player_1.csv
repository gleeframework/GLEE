"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, considering the initial offer was 60-40, which is a more favorable split for me. Meeting in the middle at 50-50 seems like a reasonable compromise, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve more too 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of my potential gain in the first round. With 48.8% less, my gain of $4800 is equivalent to $4800 / 0.5172 = $9281.64 in the first round.

Considering the initial offer was $6000, and now Bob is offering me $9281.64 equivalent, it's a significant increase. However, Bob's gain of $5200 is still a substantial amount, and I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with further inflation.
