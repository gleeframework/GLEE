"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600, ""alice_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""My turn. I think this is more reasonable considering the inflation.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's offer in round 1 heavily favored her. It made sense to reject it, hoping for a better deal in the next round.
* **My offer:** I'm aiming for a more advantageous split in round 2, taking into account the inflation that is eroding the value of the money.  Alice's share is slightly larger than what mine would have been in round 1, which might make it appealing enough to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a better compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation, it's still tilted in her favor. The rate at which the money is devaluing for me (36% by round 3) is almost double that of Alice (19%).  Holding out might force her to propose a more balanced split in the next round, even with the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is the most sensible option. Let's end this before we lose more.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  The inflation is aggressively eating into the value of the money.  Every round makes the potential gain significantly smaller.
* **Fairness:** While I was aiming for a slight advantage in earlier rounds, a 50/50 split is the fairest and most likely to be accepted quickly at this point.  It's better to secure half than risk ending up with a smaller share (or nothing) if the negotiations drag on."
