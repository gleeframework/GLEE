"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair deal?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly suggestion to split the money 60-40, which is a fair deal considering the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor.  It's a fair deal, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to flip the script, but I'm not buying it. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less than before. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a 60-40 split, but I'll give you 58% this time. It's a generous offer!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority. The message is a playful jab at Bob's previous offer."
