I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share than my first offer, but still a significant amount.  This should be attractive enough to incentivize him to accept, as we are already in the third round.  I'm aiming to secure a majority share while still showing flexibility."

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly.  Bob's offers are consistently decreasing, so I need to show that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to give away too much of my share.  We're nearing the end of the game, and I need to ensure I secure a decent amount of money for myself."
