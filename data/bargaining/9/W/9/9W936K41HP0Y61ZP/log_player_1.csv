"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, but this is a fair start.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is fair. He's proposing a 60-40 split, which is too skewed in his favor. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a better deal. Let's meet in the middle.""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, trying to find a middle ground and hoping Bob will accept this offer."
