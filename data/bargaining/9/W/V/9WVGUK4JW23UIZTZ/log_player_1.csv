Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet exactly in the middle and split the difference. The inflation is taking its toll, and I think we should both walk away with a fair share. This is my most reasonable offer yet.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the safest option at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value quickly. Waiting longer means even a ""good"" deal will be worth significantly less.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems to be fixated on a near-even split. He's unlikely to offer significantly more.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 8 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing increases with every rejection.

It's better to secure a decent share now than risk getting nothing later."
