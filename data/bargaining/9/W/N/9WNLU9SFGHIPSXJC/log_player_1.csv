"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money, knowing there's inflation to consider, but still trying to be fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a big factor, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
