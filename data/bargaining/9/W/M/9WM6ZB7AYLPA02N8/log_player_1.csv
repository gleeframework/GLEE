"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent amount upfront, but I think we should aim for a more balanced split. This 4/1 split gives me a fair share, but still allows you to get a significant amount before inflation hits. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
