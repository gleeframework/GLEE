# Alice gain: 65

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My position hasn't changed - this is a fair deal considering the devaluation. I'm standing firm. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit Bob's higher inflation rate.  While the deal is getting worse, Bob still loses significantly more than Alice in each round. It's time to show firmness and demonstrate that Bob won't be pushed around.  There's still time for Alice to propose a more reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my previous offer.  It's a fair deal given the circumstances.  Let's not let this drag on any longer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Demonstrate resolve:**  Bob needs to show Alice he's serious about getting a better deal and won't be worn down.  Repeating his previous offer conveys this.
* **Time pressure:** While Bob is suffering from higher inflation, Alice also loses value with each passing round.  Keeping the pressure on encourages her to settle. 
* **Appearance of compromise:** Even though Bob is repeating his offer, framing it as ""sticking to"" his guns makes it sound like a concession, potentially making Alice more receptive."
