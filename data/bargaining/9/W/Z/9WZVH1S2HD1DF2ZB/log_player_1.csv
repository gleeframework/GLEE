"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you a decent amount. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively generous amount, considering the inflation will reduce its value over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a good start to the negotiations!

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 2/3 of the money, even if it's a compromise. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more for myself. Can we find a middle ground?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a larger portion for myself."

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to squeeze more out of me!

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up more than I did in the previous offer, and I think I can do better than this. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own gain. Let's find a compromise.""
}
```

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've been negotiating for a while, and this offer is relatively fair, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'm willing to take 52% of the remaining $10,000."
