Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly even split, hoping to reach an agreement quickly. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is better than what I initially proposed, and I don't want to risk further rounds with potential inflation eating away at my share."
