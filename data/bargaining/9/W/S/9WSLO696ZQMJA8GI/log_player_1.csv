"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob will accept or counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'm now considering a proposal that values my gain at 90% of the original value and Bob's gain at 80% of the original value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I did in the first round. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
