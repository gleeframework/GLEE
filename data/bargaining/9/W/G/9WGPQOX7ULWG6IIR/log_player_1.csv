"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair share, Alice! Let's split it 7:3 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually worth $270,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer.
