"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get the better deal, as I'm the first to make the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no need to fight 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gains.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise. Meeting in the middle would give me $5,000, which is 50% of the current value of the money, and Bob would get the same amount. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
