We're past the halfway point, and Alice is still stubbornly fixated on that 55-45 split.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better share, even if it means risking a worse outcome."

It's risky, but with only three rounds left, Alice seems anchored to that 55/45 split. It's better to take a decent share now than risk getting nothing at all if she's truly unwilling to budge."
