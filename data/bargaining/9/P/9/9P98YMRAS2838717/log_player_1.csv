"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm framing it as a fair split to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if we can agree on a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll get $76 instead of $80. Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he'll get $45 instead of $50.

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a 50/50 split, which seems fair. I'll take the $76 and we can end the game.
