"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I'm not satisfied with the 60-40 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting more aggressive!

Considering the money is worth even less now, I think I should be more cautious. However, the 62-38 split is still a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor. I'll have to think carefully...

After some consideration, I decide to reject this offer as well.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The stakes are getting higher!

Considering the rapid inflation, I'll aim for a more significant share of the remaining money. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm pushing for a slightly more favorable split, but still leaving room for negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is rapidly losing its value, and the stakes are getting higher!

Considering the extremely low value of the money now, I think I should be more aggressive in my negotiation. However, the 65-35 split is still a relatively fair offer, considering the circumstances.

After some thought, I decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
