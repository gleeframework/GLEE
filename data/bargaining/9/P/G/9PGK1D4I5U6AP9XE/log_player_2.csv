"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round, I'm willing to take a risk to try to get more than half. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since I'm taking the risk of inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think we can find a split that's better for both of us.  Let's work together. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice is offering a compromise, I'm not ready to accept an offer that's less than 50% of the original amount, especially since the money is worth almost 10% less to me now. I'll continue to negotiate to try to get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk with inflation, so I'll take a bit more. But I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle of our previous offers.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly again. We're both losing money with each round, and this is getting ridiculous.  
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the money is worth 18.55% less to me now, I think it's time to accept the offer and split the money evenly. The risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing more value to inflation is too high, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we can't agree within the 12 rounds. Let's take the 50/50 split and end the game!"
