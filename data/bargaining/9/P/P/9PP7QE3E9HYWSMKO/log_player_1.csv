"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, a 50-50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to be more cautious with my decision. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I think Bob's offer is a good one. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going into more rounds with decreasing value.
