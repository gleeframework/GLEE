"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that gives me only 30% of the remaining amount.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse offer. I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now.
