Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I'll take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This will hopefully make him want to accept quickly, leaving us both with something!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have liked to get more, 5,000 is a decent share, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by rejecting and going to the next round."
