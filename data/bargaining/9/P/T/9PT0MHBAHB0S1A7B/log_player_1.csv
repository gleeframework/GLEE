"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he's going to be greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is ridiculous. While the money is worth less now, I'm still getting far less than I should. I'm going to try to counter offer and see if he'll compromise a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm going to offer a more reasonable split, but still leaning heavily in my favor. I'm hoping Bob is willing to meet me halfway and negotiate something fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share. I'll try to make another counter-offer, hoping he'll understand that he needs to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't be taken advantage of. I'm still trying to get a fair share, and I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still being very greedy. I'm not going to accept his offer, even though the money is worth significantly less now. I'll try to make one last counter offer and see if I can get him to budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm dropping my offer to 600,000 for myself and offering Bob 400,000. Time is running out, and I need to find a middle ground. This is my final attempt to reach an agreement before we both lose everything."
