"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need more than $40 to make this worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see how the math works out in later rounds and try to negotiate a better deal."
