"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to go all in and offer Bob a very small share.  Inflation is high, and we're nearing the end of the game. I need to secure as much of the remaining value as possible.  I believe this offer is my best chance to get a decent share before the money becomes worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10

```

Bob is being extremely unreasonable.  While I understand the pressure of inflation, I refuse to accept such a paltry sum.  I'll try to negotiate a more equitable division in the next round."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is ridiculous! I refuse to accept nothing. Even though the money has significantly depreciated, I'd rather get nothing than give Bob all of it."
