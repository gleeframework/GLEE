Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000.  I'm starting with a generous offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the future given the inflation factor.  It's a 70/30 split in my favor, which is still a good outcome considering the circumstances."
