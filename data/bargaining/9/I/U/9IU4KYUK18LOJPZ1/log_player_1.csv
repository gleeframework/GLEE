"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to take 700,000 dollars, leaving 300,000 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, the actual amount I would gain in this round is 500,000 * 0.95 = 475,000.

I accept Bob's offer.
