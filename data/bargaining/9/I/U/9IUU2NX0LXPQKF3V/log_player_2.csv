Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more, considering the initial offer. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a better deal, I'm concerned about further inflation and running out of time. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and Alice seems to be unwilling to negotiate further."
