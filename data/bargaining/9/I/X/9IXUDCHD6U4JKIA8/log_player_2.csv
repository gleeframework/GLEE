Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a factor, but it's not critical yet. Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, but it's still heavily weighted in her favor.  I'm willing to gamble another round that she'll become more agreeable as the diminishing returns become apparent to both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A perfectly even split. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Offering anything more than a 50/50 split is increasingly risky for me with each round due to the inflation.  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to signal that I'm serious and push Alice to accept a deal before the diminishing returns make it truly disadvantageous for both of us."
