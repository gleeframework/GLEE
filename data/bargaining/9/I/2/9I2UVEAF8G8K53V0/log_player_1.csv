"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, you can't do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and giving me only $400,000 is not acceptable. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm proposing that I get $480,000 and Bob gets $520,000. I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, but still trying to get a better deal than Bob's previous offer."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. I was hoping to get closer to an even split, but giving me only $460,000 is still not good enough. I'll reject this offer and try to make a new proposal that will get me a better deal."
