{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite bold! I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Considering the inflation, I think it's more than fair. Don't you agree?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe your proposal was a bit too generous for yourself. I'm proposing a 40/60 split in your favor this round. Let's be reasonable and find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
