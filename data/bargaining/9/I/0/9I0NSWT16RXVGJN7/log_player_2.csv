"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and we can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 60/40 split is a good compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nSince it's my turn, I'll make a more reasonable offer, considering the 20% decrease in value for me and only 5% for Alice. Meeting in the middle seems fair, and it gives us both a substantial amount. The message conveys my intention to find a mutually acceptable solution."
