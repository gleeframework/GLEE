"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to divide this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amount I would get is $900,000 * 0.9 = $810,000.

Considering the offer, I would rather have a larger share to account for the inflation. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the $1,000,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's effectively $900,000.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the $1,000,000 is now worth 90% of its original value in round 3, and 81.9% of its original value in round 1. So, the actual amount I would get is $900,000 * 0.819 = $737,100.

Considering the offer, I think a 60/40 split is still too generous for Bob, especially considering the inflation. I'll reject the offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I would get is $900,000 * 0.271 = $243,900.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
