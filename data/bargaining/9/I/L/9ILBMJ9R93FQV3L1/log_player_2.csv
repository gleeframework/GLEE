"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gives us a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair, it's crucial to remember the inflation rates. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a proposal in the next round, and with each passing round, the money becomes worth less for Alice, giving me a better negotiation position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split considering the inflation rates. We both get a good amount, and it gives us a chance to start the game off strong.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the most sensible.  Time is running out for you, and the value is decreasing rapidly. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still not a good deal for me in the long run. The inflation rate is heavily impacting the value of the money for me, and rejecting this offer keeps me in the game, allowing me to make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we're losing value with each round. Let's split this evenly and get the most we can. It's a fair deal, and we can both get a good amount without further risk.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're losing significantly more than I am with each round. This offer is the best you'll get - accept it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 3300 
# Alice gain: 6700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice is correct that I'm losing more value per round, I'm still not convinced this is the best deal I'll get. I've made several proposals and am still in the game, and with each round, Alice's gains are also diminishing. I'll continue to play and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing value with every round.  This offer gives us a decent split, and it's the best we can get without risking a worse outcome.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're feeling the pressure. This is your last chance for a somewhat reasonable deal. Take it before you're left with nothing! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's message is concerning, I'm still not ready to accept this offer. I've shown willingness to negotiate, and the inflation rate is affecting Alice's gains as well. I'll continue playing and see if I can secure a better deal.  I'm still confident that I can get a more favorable outcome with a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, with each passing round, we're both losing more. This offer is a compromise that allows us both to get something. Let's end this before it's too late.""
