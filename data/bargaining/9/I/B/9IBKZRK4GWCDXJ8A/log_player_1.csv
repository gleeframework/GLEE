"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving 900,000 dollars and Bob receiving 100,000 dollars.  This seems fair considering Bob will also be losing money due to inflation, so I'm offering him a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'm reducing my share slightly to 850,000 dollars, while increasing Bob's to 150,000. This is a compromise to hopefully avoid further rounds of rejection and the further loss of value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted, the inflation is really impacting the value of the money.  At this point, accepting 200,000 is better than continuing to risk further losses."
