"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in our best interest. Take it while it's still good.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Initial Offer:** Starting with a 65/35 split in Alice's favor is assertive but not outrageously unfair. It gives room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the money upfront. 
* **Leveraging Inflation:** The message subtly emphasizes the impact of inflation. Bob's share decreases slower, making it slightly more advantageous for him to wait. However, highlighting the decreasing value aims to incentivize a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical, Alice. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us while time is still on our side. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor, especially after accounting for inflation. Accepting this would leave Alice with significantly less than she could potentially secure. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and puts pressure on Bob as the value decreases in each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money. I'm being fair, but this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure through Ultimatum:**  By presenting this as Alice's final offer, she creates a sense of urgency. Bob knows if he rejects this, there's no guarantee of a counter-offer, and further delay only erodes the value.
* **Strategic Concession:** Alice concedes slightly from her initial 65% ask, but the 55/45 split still favors her. It reflects a willingness to negotiate while holding a firm position.
* **Inflation Reminder:**  The message indirectly reminds Bob about the decreasing value, emphasizing the disadvantage of prolonging the game."
