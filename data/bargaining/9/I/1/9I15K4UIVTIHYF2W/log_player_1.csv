"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large share early on.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Even with the inflation, I can still get a better deal by waiting. I believe I can get closer to a 50/50 split by making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm taking a slightly less aggressive approach this round, hoping to find a middle ground that Bob might accept.  Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'm willing to give up a little to make it a more appealing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still not willing to settle for such a lopsided deal.  I believe I can negotiate a better outcome, especially since Bob seems to be playing a bit aggressively."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to try a compromise this time. While the inflation is making my potential gains less, I'm willing to give up a bit more of the share to reach a more balanced offer. This might encourage Bob to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the best I can do at this point. The inflation is making my potential gains even smaller, and while I'd prefer more than 50, accepting this offer means at least getting something, while rejecting might result in getting nothing."
