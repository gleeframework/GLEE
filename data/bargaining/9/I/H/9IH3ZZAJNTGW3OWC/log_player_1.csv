"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm actually losing value in real terms. Bob's gain, on the other hand, is worth 10% less than in the first round, which means he's gaining even more value in real terms.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm trying to compromise and give Bob a slightly smaller share, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for him than it seems. His gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means he's losing value in real terms. On the other hand, my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, so I'm actually gaining more value in real terms.

Given this, I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
