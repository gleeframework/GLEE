"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a classic game theory scenario, and the ""rational"" choice is to try and maximize your own gain.  I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he might accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, it's more likely Bob will reject any offer that gives me a larger percentage, as he knows he's now in a position of power. It's better to accept this offer and secure some money than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
