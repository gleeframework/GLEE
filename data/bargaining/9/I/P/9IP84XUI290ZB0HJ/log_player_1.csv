I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted to take it rather than risk getting less later. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though my share is significantly lower, it's still better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds, especially considering the inflation rate. It's time to take what I can get."
