Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a significant portion, considering the inflation working against you.  This is a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
