``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 49/51 split in round 7 is a rationally sound move for Bob. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice has consistently shown a desire for a larger share. It's unlikely she'll agree to anything significantly better than this offer.
* **Something is Better than Nothing:**  Accepting $49 is far superior to the outcome of receiving $0 if the negotiations fail."
