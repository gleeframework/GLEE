{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start by being generous with Bob.  I'll take $9,000 and leave him $1,000. I think this is a fair offer, as it gives Bob a decent amount while still leaving me with the majority."

Round 2

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is tempting right now, I'm not going to accept it. If I reject, I'll be the one making the offer in the next round. The inflation will have a bigger impact on the money Bob gains in the next round than on the money I gain, which should make him more likely to accept my offer."
