"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses value over time, I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob might accept, while also maximizing my gain. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I need to consider the reduced value of the money in my decision. Considering this, Bob's offer of a 45-55 split in his favor is not ideal for me, especially since I initially offered a 60-40 split in my favor.\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nYour turn! What will Bob do next?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll offer a 57-43 split in my favor, which is closer to the original offer but still takes into account the inflation.\n\nThe message ""Let's meet in the middle!"" is an attempt to convey that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
