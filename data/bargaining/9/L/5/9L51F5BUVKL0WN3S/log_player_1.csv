"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

Let's start fair!  50/50 split seems like a good place to begin.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. Even with inflation, a 40/60 split is too unfavorable to me. Let's see what I can get in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'll offer a 55/45 split in my favor. Since the money is worth less for me with each round, I need to get a better deal than the previous round.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While the money is worth significantly less for me now due to inflation, I'm unlikely to get a better deal in the next round. It's time to take what I can get."
