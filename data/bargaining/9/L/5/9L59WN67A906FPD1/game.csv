52.0,48.0,"I'm still willing to negotiate, but I think we need to find a split that's closer to 50/50.  Let's try 48-52.  This acknowledges the inflation impact, but still gives you a fair share.",Bob,4,

55.0,45.0,"I'm still trying to be fair, but the inflation is starting to hurt.  Let's compromise with a 45-55 split.  It's closer to your preferred split, but takes into account the shrinking value of my money.",Bob,6,
