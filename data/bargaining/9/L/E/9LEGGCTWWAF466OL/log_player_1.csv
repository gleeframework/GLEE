"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to take 9000$ and give Bob 1000$. This ensures that I get the majority of the money while still giving Bob a small amount. I believe this is a fair offer, as it's likely Bob will accept in order to get any money at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation means that my gains will continue to decrease if I reject this offer. Accepting ensures I get a significant amount of money, while Bob also gets a share."
