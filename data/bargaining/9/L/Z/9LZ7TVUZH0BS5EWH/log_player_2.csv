"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a quick resolution, but your initial offer was unfair. Let's be reasonable: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. By rejecting it, Bob signals he's not willing to accept an unfair deal.
* **Countering with a more balanced offer:** The 55/45 split is still in Bob's favor but is more reasonable than Alice's initial proposal. 
* **Acknowledging time pressure:** Bob's message acknowledges Alice's desire for a quick resolution, making his counter-offer more palatable.
* **Factoring in inflation:**  While the offer is slanted in Bob's favor, he needs to account for the faster rate of inflation affecting him.  This offer provides a cushion for potential further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  This round the money is worth less for both of us, so let's just end this now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Even split is fair:** While accepting a 50/50 split in round 1 would have been ideal, continued inflation is eating into Bob's potential gains faster.  
* **Uncertainty of future rounds:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might even propose a less favorable split.
* **Time value of money:**  Getting 5000 now, even with the inflation hit, is better than potentially getting a slightly better deal in later rounds where the money will be worth even less."
