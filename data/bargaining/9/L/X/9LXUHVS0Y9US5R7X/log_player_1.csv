# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I started by offering Bob $45 and he's now offering me the same amount, it seems reasonable to consider this offer. However, I need to take into account the inflation rate, which means the $45 I'd get in this round is worth 5% less than the $45 I initially offered Bob. Given that we're only in Round 2 and there are 10 more rounds to go, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's see how Bob responds!"
