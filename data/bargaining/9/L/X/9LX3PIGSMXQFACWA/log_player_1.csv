``` 
It's clear that Bob is not going to compromise, and Alice's share is getting worse with each round. There's no point in accepting this offer.  It's better to keep rejecting and hoping for a better proposal or a change in Bob's strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

While Bob's strategy seems immovable, Alice is sticking to her own pattern. She's shown a clear preference for claiming the vast majority of the money. However, with each round, her share is becoming increasingly devalued. Will she eventually be forced to accept Bob's offer, or is there another strategy hidden in her stubbornness?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is clearly playing a stubborn game.  Even though her share is shrinking dramatically, she is still holding onto the hope of a better deal. It's likely she's hoping Bob will eventually tire of the game and offer a more balanced split. However, if she continues to reject every offer, she might eventually be left with a very small share of the pie.  It's a high-risk strategy, and it remains to be seen if it will pay off."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 12.
Round 13
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

Alice's strategy is starting to look more like a gamble.  She's taking a significant risk with her share decreasing dramatically.  While her stubbornness might eventually wear Bob down, it's also possible she'll be left with very little. Will her strategy pay off, or will she be forced to accept a much less favorable deal?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 13.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice continues to hold her ground, stubbornly refusing to accept Bob's offer.  It's a risky strategy, as her share continues to shrink with each round.  While she might hope to wear down Bob's resolve, she's also pushing the boundaries of her own financial well-being. It's unclear whether this stubbornness will lead to a breakthrough or leave her with a mere fraction of the original pie. The tension is mounting, and the next round could prove to be a turning point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 14.
Round 15
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

Alice's determination is unwavering. Despite the shrinking value of her share, she continues to propose the same lopsided split. This unwavering stance is a high-risk strategy. While it might ultimately pressure Bob into a more favorable deal, the risk of ending up with a miniscule portion of the money is substantial. The next round could mark a crucial turning point in this game of wills."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 15.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's refusal to budge is starting to look like a dangerous gamble. With each round, her share is worth less and less. If she doesn't start compromising soon, she risks ending up with a tiny fraction of the original money.  Her stubbornness has so far been unsuccessful, and it's unclear whether she'll eventually see reason or be forced to accept a far less favorable deal."

{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 17.

Round 18

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's strategy is becoming increasingly risky, with her share continuously shrinking.  However, there's no guarantee Bob will change his strategy either. It's a high-stakes gamble with no clear winner in sight. She's clinging to the hope of a better deal, but the longer this game goes on, the less likely that hope becomes."

{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice has reached a crossroads.  The value of her share is now drastically reduced, and there's no guarantee Bob will ever change his strategy.  Accepting this offer would mean losing almost everything, but continuing to reject it could lead to a similar outcome.  The decision is a tough one, and there's no clear answer. She might choose to continue with her strategy, hoping Bob eventually changes his mind, or she could gamble by accepting and see what happens.  It's a gamble either way."

Alice is showing unwavering resolve. She is clearly willing to take a massive financial hit, and her stubbornness is becoming legendary.  However, she risks losing everything.

```

Alice continues with her unwavering strategy, even as the value of her share dwindles.  She seems determined to stick to her guns, hoping to force a change in Bob's approach. However, the risk is becoming increasingly high.  Will her persistence pay off, or will she be left with a fraction of what she could have earned? The next round could be crucial."

Alice continues to stand her ground, a testament to her unwavering resolve.  Her share is now a mere shadow of its former value, but she's betting on her stubbornness to eventually force Bob into a compromise. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy.

{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's stubbornness is now a desperate act.  She's clinging to a vanishingly small chance of winning, while her potential earnings are shrinking rapidly.  The game is nearly over, and Alice is on the brink of disaster.   She's facing a stark choice:  accept a pittance and salvage something, or continue her stubborn stand and risk losing everything.  The decision is a tough one, with high stakes on either side.  It's a classic case of sunk cost fallacy, where she's clinging to her initial strategy, even though it's clearly failing."
