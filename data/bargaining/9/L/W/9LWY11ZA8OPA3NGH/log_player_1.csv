I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to get a quick resolution.  I'll take 90% and leave 10% for Bob.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer more,  a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation.  Accepting guarantees me a significant amount, and further rounds could potentially lead to a worse outcome for me due to inflation."
