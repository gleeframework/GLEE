"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  I think that's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because, adjusted for inflation, I'm giving up more value than I'm gaining. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm offering a slightly more generous split to account for the decreasing value of money. Accept and we can end the game!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, while still offering Bob a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  I think we can both walk away with more than this if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the value of money is decreasing rapidly. Considering the reduced value of the money I'd gain, I'll evaluate the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because, adjusted for inflation, I'm giving up even more value than I'm gaining. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the accelerated decrease in the value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the rapid inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it evenly now and avoid further losses.""
}
```

I'm proposing an even split, hoping to take advantage of the current situation and limit further losses due to inflation."
