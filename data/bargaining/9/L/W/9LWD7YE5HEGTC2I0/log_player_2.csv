# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the rapid inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it evenly now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still want a larger share,  the inflation is becoming a serious problem. Accepting this offer ensures we both get something, and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
