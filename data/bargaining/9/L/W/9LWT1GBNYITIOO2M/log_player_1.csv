"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since I'm playing as Alice, I want to maximize my gains. I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split, giving me a large share while still offering Bob something. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively unequal split early on.  It also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While this is a much less favorable split than my initial proposal, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  My potential gains are now 10% less than in the previous round, while Bob's potential gains are 20% less. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, whereas rejecting it risks losing everything if we run out of rounds.  It's a strategic move to ensure some gain, despite the unfavorable terms."
