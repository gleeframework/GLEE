"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money I gain in the second round is worth 80% of the first round's amount, so the effective amount I gain in the second round is $480,000 (600,000 * 0.8).

I'm not sure if this offer is fair, as Bob is getting the same amount as me, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 20% inflation, the effective amount of money in the third round is worth 64% of the first round's amount (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). So, the effective amount I'm working with is $640,000.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% inflation, the effective amount of money in the fourth round is worth 51.2% of the first round's amount (1 - 0.488 = 0.512). So, the effective amount I'm working with is $512,000.

I'm not sure if this offer is fair, but I'll consider it. However, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 48.8% inflation, the effective amount of money in the fifth round is worth 51.2% of the first round's amount. So, the effective amount I'm working with is $512,000.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}

I'm willing to compromise and offer Bob a slightly higher amount than my previous offer, but still keeping a slight edge for myself."
