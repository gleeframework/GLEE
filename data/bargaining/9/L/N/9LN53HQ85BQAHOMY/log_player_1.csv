I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair, especially considering the inflation impact. I'm going to reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to try and get closer to a 50/50 split. I'll offer Bob 400,000, hoping he'll see the value of getting something sooner rather than waiting and potentially getting nothing in the end."
