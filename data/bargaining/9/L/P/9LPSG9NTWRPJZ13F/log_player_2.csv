I reject this offer. It's not fair, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if she's willing to play fair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's getting risky. The inflation is hitting Alice harder than me, so this might be the best I can get."
