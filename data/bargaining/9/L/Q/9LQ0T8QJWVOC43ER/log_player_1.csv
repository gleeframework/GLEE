"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"

# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about meeting in the middle, as I was hoping to get a better deal. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 70/30?""}

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy about the 27.1% decrease in value, and Bob's offer is still quite far from what I was hoping for. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a better deal. How about 60/40?""}

I'm trying to be more aggressive again, but I'm also aware that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I'm trying to make a more realistic offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up much more, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but considering the rapid inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I think I should accept this offer. I'm not sure if I can do better than this, and I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially losing even more value. I'll accept Bob's offer and take the $3,000."
