"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

This way, I get 80% of the original $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
Bob gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5

I accept this offer.
