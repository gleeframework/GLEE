"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and leave Bob with $30. I'm framing this as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's work together to reach a good outcome. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $36. Bob's gain of $60 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $48.

I'm not sure if this offer is better for me than my original offer, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is proposing a more even split, I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2 for me, and 20% less than in round 2 for Bob.

My offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the remaining $100, which is $45, and leave Bob with $55. I'm framing this as a ""meet in the middle"" offer to see if Bob will accept it."
