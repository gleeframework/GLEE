**Reasoning:**

While I could try to push for a slightly larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the safest option.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value with each round. Delaying further significantly impacts the overall amount we both receive.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to agree in the remaining rounds.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is inherently fair, and Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate by moving towards a more even distribution."
