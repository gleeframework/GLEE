Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle with a 50-50 split. No more negotiations! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll take the 50-50 split. The inflation is making me nervous!"
