"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether 400,000 is a good deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit low, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more aggressive. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you 450k, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk""}

I'm offering Bob 450,000, which is a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but still leaves me with a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 450k, but I think I can get a better deal if we wait 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'm starting to feel like I'm not getting anywhere.

However, I'll take a closer look at Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations. 450,000 is still a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to wait and see if Bob can get a ""better deal"".
