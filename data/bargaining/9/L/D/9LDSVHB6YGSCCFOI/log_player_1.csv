"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you a generous 10% of the total. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to show good faith."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 600,000 is actually worth 540,000 (90% of 600,000) in real value. Bob's gain of 400,000 is worth 380,000 (95% of 400,000).

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept it.
