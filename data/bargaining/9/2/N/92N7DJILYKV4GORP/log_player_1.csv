Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'm not too keen on Bob's offer.

```

```

I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55/45 is a fair compromise.""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers!

Given the significant difference in the value of the money for both of us, I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split. I'll try to hold out for a better deal.
