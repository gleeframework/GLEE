Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer Alice.  The money is losing value for me, but I'm trying to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd like to have more, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for Bob. This makes him more likely to accept a less favorable deal in later rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject this offer, I run the risk of Bob offering me even less in the next round, especially since he called this his ""final offer."" Getting $6,000 now is better than potentially getting $5,500 or less later. 
* **Bob's Position:** Bob seems to be anchoring his offers around the 60/40 split. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.

By accepting, I secure a reasonable amount and avoid the risk of getting a worse deal in a future round."
