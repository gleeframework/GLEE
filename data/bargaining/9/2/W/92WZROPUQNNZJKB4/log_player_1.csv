"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split, considering I have the upper hand in future rounds due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to secure a larger share to offset the growing inflation. Let's split it 55/45 this time.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your share, I believe 65/35 is a fair split at this point. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While the offer is still unfavorable, the inflation rate is making future rounds increasingly risky.  Accepting this offer is the best strategy to secure some money before the inflation significantly erodes my potential gains."
