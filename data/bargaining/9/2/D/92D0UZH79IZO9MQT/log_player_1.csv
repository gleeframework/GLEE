"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's take it from here! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering that my money is still worth the same as in the first round. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly higher share.""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share by $500 from the previous round, hoping to get a better deal. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because he's now asking for a 60-40 split, which is not acceptable to me, especially considering that his share is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'd like to propose another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway on the 60-40 split, but I'd like a slightly better share for myself.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposed share to be closer to Bob's previous offer, but still slightly favoring myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you're getting close to my minimum! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, although it's still a 70-30 split in his favor, the difference is relatively small, and I'm not willing to risk going to another round with the money continuing to lose value due to inflation. I'll take the 3000."
