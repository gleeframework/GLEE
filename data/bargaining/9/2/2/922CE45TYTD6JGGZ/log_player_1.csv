I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I believe it is a fair starting point.  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round, this offer gives him a small but significant share while still offering me the majority.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal.  The inflation has hurt him more than me, but I believe I can still get a better deal.  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. This takes into account the inflation that has impacted Bob more than me.  This offer provides him with a decent share, but also allows me to keep a larger portion of the money. Let's see if this is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unacceptable. Although inflation has impacted him more significantly, he's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm sticking with a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging the significant inflation that has impacted both of us. This offer is a compromise, offering Bob a decent share while still allowing me to secure a majority. Hopefully, he will see the value in reaching an agreement before we both lose more money."
