Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my new offer is 58-42. It's still a good deal for you, don't let the money lose more value! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, but I'm willing to gamble another round to try and secure a better deal."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time! I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more for making the first offer. 56-44 is my new proposal. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is really starting to bite now, and Alice is unlikely to offer a better deal at this stage. Accepting 440,000 is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
