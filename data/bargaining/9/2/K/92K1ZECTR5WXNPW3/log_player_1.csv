Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose that I get $9000 and Bob gets $1000. This seems like a fair starting point, as I am risking more by potentially going through more rounds and seeing the money lose value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer to have more money, I think this is the best offer I'm going to get.  Inflation will continue to reduce the value of my share, and it's likely Bob will continue to offer this 50/50 split in future rounds."
