Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to make sure both of us get a good deal to avoid losing out later. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
