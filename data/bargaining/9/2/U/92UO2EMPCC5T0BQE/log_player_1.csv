"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let us divide fairly""}\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. Given the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases by 5% for Bob in each subsequent round but remains unchanged for me, this initial offer seems reasonable as it gives Bob a significant amount while also considering my own interests. The message ""Let us divide fairly"" aims to convey a sense of fairness and cooperation, encouraging Bob to accept this offer and conclude the game in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, given the potential for inflation. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because it significantly favors him, giving him 60% of the money, which is worth less due to inflation, but still a larger share than what I initially offered him. Given that the value of money remains the same for me across rounds, I have no immediate incentive to accept an offer that gives me less than what I initially proposed. Additionally, since the value of money decreases for Bob with each round, waiting might put pressure on him to offer a more favorable split in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share than in my initial proposal, while also considering the impact of inflation on his gains. By suggesting a ""middle ground,"" I aim to appear more conciliatory and flexible, potentially making the offer more appealing to Bob. Since the value of money hasn't changed for me but has decreased for Bob, this offer still leans in my favor but shows a willingness to compromise."
