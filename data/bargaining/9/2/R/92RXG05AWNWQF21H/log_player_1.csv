"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept this offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving up too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, he's offering me 70 dollars, but it's actually worth less than 70 dollars in real value. I'll calculate the actual value of his offer:

70 * 0.8 = 56 dollars (since the money is worth 80% of its original value)

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's less than my previous offer of 60 dollars. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal for Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced, Bob. I'll make a new offer in Round 3.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. 50-50 seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 50 dollars and leaving 50 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not ready to give up yet. You'll have to do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in the first round, and 48.8% less in the fourth round, I'll calculate the actual value of his offer:

Original value of Bob's gain in the first round: 40 dollars
Value of Bob's gain in the fourth round: 40 * (1 - 0.208) * (1 - 0.488) = 40 * 0.792 * 0.512 = 20.416 dollars

However, Bob is offering me 75 dollars, which is actually worth less than the calculated value of his gain. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, your offer is not as generous as you think it is. I'll make a new offer in Round 5.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. 55-45 seems like a fair split to me.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55 dollars and leaving 45 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not convinced. I'll give you a bit more, but don't think you're getting away that easily! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in the first round, and 67.23% less in the sixth round, I'll calculate the actual value of his offer:

Original value of Bob's gain in the first round: 40 dollars
Value of Bob's gain in the sixth round: 40 * (1 - 0.2028) * (1 - 0.6723) = 40 * 0.7982 * 0.3277 = 10.37 dollars

However, Bob is offering me 80 dollars, which is actually worth less than the calculated value of his gain. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, your offer is still not good enough. I'll make a new offer in Round 7.""
