"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking 900,000$ and giving 100,000$ to Bob. This is a fair starting point, as it gives me the majority, but still gives Bob something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! Even though I'm losing 5% on my gain, that offer is still way too low for me. I'm going to reject it and make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still going to aim for a majority of the money, but I'm increasing Bob's share a little bit to make the offer more appealing. Since the money is losing value, it's important to get a deal done soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, and the money is losing value significantly.  I'll accept this offer and avoid the risk of further inflation."
