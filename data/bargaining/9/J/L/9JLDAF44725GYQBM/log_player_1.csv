"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $20, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, and I'll take the remaining $80. This way, we both get something, and we can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, let's try to do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in Round 2, my gain of $40 is actually worth $32.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2. I'm hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. We're both getting less due to inflation, so let's aim for an equal split.""
}
```

I'm proposing an equal split, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you something for your trouble. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now! Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $20 is actually worth $10.40.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4. At least I'll get something, even if it's a small amount.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
