"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Bob's offer is 40% for me and 60% for him. Since the money is worth less, this is actually a more favorable offer than it initially seems. I'm not thrilled about giving up 60%, but it's better than the 60% I was initially offered.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
