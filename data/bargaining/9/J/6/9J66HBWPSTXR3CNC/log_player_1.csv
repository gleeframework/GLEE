"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less than half""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob. My message is to try to make a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both have to agree.  Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth $360,000 (80% of $450,000) and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth $517,500 (95% of $550,000).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the money is worth less now. I'd like to think about it for a moment.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering to take $540,000 and leaving $460,000 for Bob. My message is to convey that I'm still willing to make a deal, but I'm taking a slightly larger share this time."
