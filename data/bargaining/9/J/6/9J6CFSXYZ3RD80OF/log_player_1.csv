"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 55/45 split is a fair compromise, considering the potential for inflation. This allows us both to gain a significant portion of the money while minimizing the risk of losing out due to the decreasing value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
