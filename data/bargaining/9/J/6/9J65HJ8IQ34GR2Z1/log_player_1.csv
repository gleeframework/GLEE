"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent chunk to make it worth his while to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the value of the offer is now:

```
# Alice gain: 3800
# Bob gain: 5700
```

I'll accept this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
