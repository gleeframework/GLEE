Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. 10 dollars is too low, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try to get a higher amount."
