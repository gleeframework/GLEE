"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after one round, I'll make an offer that takes that into account. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 32, ""alice_gain"": 68}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 35$ is actually worth 35 * 0.81 = 28.35$ in the first round, which is more than my initial offer of 28$. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
