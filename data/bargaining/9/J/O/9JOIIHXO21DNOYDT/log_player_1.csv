"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives Alice 60% of the money, while Bob receives 40%.  This seems like a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant advantage for Alice but still leaves a decent portion for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, accepting this offer ensures I get a guaranteed $5000.  It's unlikely Bob will offer me more in the next round, and the risk of inflation making his offer less valuable for him is high."
