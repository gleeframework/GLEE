"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. Since the value of money doesn't decrease for me but does for Bob, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering him a smaller share. However, I still want to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting it, rather than risking further devaluation of his potential gain in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think a 60/40 split is more reflective of the situation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, given that the value of money remains the same for me across rounds, accepting a 40-60 split that gives me $400,000 is less favorable compared to my initial offer of a 60-40 split. Since Bob's potential gain decreases by 20% with each round due to inflation, I'm betting on the possibility that he may become more inclined to accept a less favorable offer in future rounds rather than risking further devaluation of his share. My strategy is to wait and see if Bob becomes more willing to compromise as the rounds progress and the value of his potential gain decreases."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making an offer that is slightly more favorable to me than my initial offer, with a 65-35 split. Given that Bob's potential gain decreases by 20% with each round, the actual value of what he would receive is significantly less than in the initial round. By pointing out the effect of inflation in my message, I'm trying to make Bob realize that accepting a slightly less favorable offer now might be better than holding out and seeing the value of his potential gain decrease even further in subsequent rounds. This strategy aims to take advantage of the pressure inflation puts on Bob's decision-making, encouraging him to accept my offer rather than risking additional loss of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is working against me, let's settle this now with a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite his message suggesting a reasonable compromise, the offer of a 45-55 split still doesn't align with my strategic advantage. Given that the value of money remains constant for me but decreases significantly for Bob due to inflation, I believe I can push for a more favorable split. At this point, Bob's potential gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which significantly weakens his bargaining position. My strategy is to continue applying pressure, anticipating that Bob will become increasingly desperate to finalize the deal as the value of his potential gain continues to plummet. I'm aiming for an even better offer in the next round, leveraging the impact of inflation to maximize my gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, settle now""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making an even more aggressive offer, with a 70-30 split in my favor. Given that Bob's potential gain is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round due to inflation, I believe he is under significant pressure to accept a less favorable deal rather than risking further devaluation. By emphasizing in my message that inflation is taking a significant toll on his potential earnings, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to settle now rather than continuing to negotiate. My strategy is to capitalize on the impact of inflation on Bob's bargaining position, pushing for the most favorable split possible while still hoping that Bob will accept the offer rather than letting the game continue indefinitely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This needs to end now. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. Despite Bob's message that a 50-50 split is the only fair outcome, I have to consider the strategic advantage I've gained due to the impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings. At this point, Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, which puts him in a very weak bargaining position. Given that the value of money remains constant for me across rounds, accepting a 50-50 split would mean giving up the opportunity to capitalize on Bob's desperation and the significant devaluation of his potential gain. My strategy is to continue pushing for a more favorable split, anticipating that Bob's urgency to finalize the deal will increase as the value of his potential gain continues to decrease with each round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Final offer, inflation is crippling your gain""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making an offer that is even more favorable to me, with a 75-25 split. Given that Bob's potential gain is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round and will continue to decrease, I believe he is in a desperate position. By labeling this as my ""final offer"" and emphasizing the devastating impact of inflation on his potential earnings, I'm trying to convey that I will not compromise further and that Bob should accept this offer rather than risking additional loss of value. My strategy is to use the pressure of inflation and the threat of walking away to secure the most favorable deal possible, betting that Bob will prefer to accept a significantly less favorable split now rather than seeing the value of his potential gain dwindle even further."
