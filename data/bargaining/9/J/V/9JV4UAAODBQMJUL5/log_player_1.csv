I'm going to be greedy and take a large share in the first round. This is a risky strategy, but it gives me a good starting point.  I'm betting Bob will be more likely to accept this deal than a smaller share in the first round, since he knows the money will be worth less later on. Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer deal than my initial proposal. While I'm getting less than I hoped for, the inflation means my share would be worth even less if we keep going. It's better to secure half the money now than risk getting nothing at all."
