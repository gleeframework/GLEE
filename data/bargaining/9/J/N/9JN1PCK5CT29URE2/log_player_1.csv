This is a tough one! Here's why I made the decision to accept:

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round sees the value of my potential gain decrease significantly.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in the next round isn't worth the risk of Bob pushing for an even smaller share for me.
* **Better Than Nothing:** 40% of the original amount is still better than nothing, which is what I'll be left with if I keep rejecting offers and we reach a point where even Bob's offer is worth less than 40% due to my inflation."
