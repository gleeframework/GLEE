"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm ready to negotiate if he doesn't.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the money is worth less, I'm willing to accept this offer. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm not sure I can get a better one in the next round."
