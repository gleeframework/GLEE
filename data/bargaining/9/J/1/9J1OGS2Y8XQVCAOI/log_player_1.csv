"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your even split, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share since I'm taking the risk of not getting what I want in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
