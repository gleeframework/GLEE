"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
``` 
 
I propose a 51/49 split in my favor.  I'm starting with a slightly higher share, as inflation will affect us both, and I'm the one making the first offer. I want to secure a good deal, but I also believe it's fair to give Bob a substantial amount as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is fair, and while I'm losing 10% of the value from my perspective, it's still a good deal considering the potential for further inflation and the risk of ending up with nothing."
