"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $60 is now worth less, but I'm not sure how much less Bob's offer is worth to him. Since I don't know the exact inflation rate on his end, I'll assume his offer is still a fair middle ground.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
