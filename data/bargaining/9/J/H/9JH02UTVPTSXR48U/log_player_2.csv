**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to hold out.  It's risky, but the potential reward of a more favorable split is worth it at this stage."
