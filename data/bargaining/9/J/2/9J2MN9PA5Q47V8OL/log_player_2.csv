"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the money loses value faster for me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. The 20% decrease in value for me is significant, but I'm willing to take the risk for now. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that still acknowledges the difference in value loss but tries to bring the shares closer together. Given the inflation, it's crucial to try and settle on a deal sooner rather than later, but without giving away too much value.

{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Acknowledging your concern, but let's meet closer to the middle considering our shared loss.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's getting urgent, and the inflation hurts us both. I'm making a concession, but we need to settle this soon. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly more favorable and Alice is right about the urgency due to inflation, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I want to push for a better deal that reflects a more balanced adjustment for the value loss both of us are experiencing. Let's see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4200,
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""message"": ""Inflation is biting, but I'm willing to meet you closer to your figure if we can settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer - it's the best you'll get given the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nAt this point, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept Alice's offer. The difference in our gains is notable, but the impact of further inflation on my potential gain is too severe to risk going into another round. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a guaranteed amount now, rather than risking a potentially much lower value or even nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
