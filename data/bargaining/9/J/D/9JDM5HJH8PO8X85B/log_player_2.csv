"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair deal, considering you rejected my previous offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  We both lose value with each round, so a 50/50 split makes sense now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and the value is decreasing rapidly.  Let's take what we can get!"
