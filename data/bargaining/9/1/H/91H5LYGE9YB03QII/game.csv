400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I believe a more balanced split is fairer. I'm offering you $400,000,  which is still a considerable amount.  Let's reach an agreement before the inflation bites too hard.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal. I'm adjusting my offer to $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This recognizes the impact of inflation on both our ends while still giving me a slight advantage for proposing first.  Let's settle this now before the money shrinks further.",Alice,3,
