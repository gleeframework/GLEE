"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money into 750k for me and 250k for you. This way, we can both agree on a fair share before the inflation starts affecting the value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority of the money, but I'll give you a small share to keep you from rejecting my offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
