"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'm now considering an offer that's equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

Since Bob's offer is exactly 50/50, I'll reject it in the hopes of getting a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer is now worth 40% of the original value (80% of 80% = 64% of the original). I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 48.8% less, so I'm now considering an offer that's equivalent to $4200 in the first round.

Since Bob's offer is very close to 58/42, I'll accept it to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of the money's value.
