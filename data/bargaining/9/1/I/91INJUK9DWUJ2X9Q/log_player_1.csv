Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. I'm hoping this is enough to secure his agreement in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While my share is smaller, I'm getting a better deal than if we go to another round. My money will be worth less with each passing round, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob."
