{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's a fair deal, as I'm getting 20% less than in the first round, while Bob is still getting the same amount. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
