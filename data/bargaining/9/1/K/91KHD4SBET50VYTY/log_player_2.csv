"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a bit biased, Alice. How about we meet in the middle with 55/45?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is eating into our potential gains. I'll come down a bit, but let's settle this before inflation eats us alive. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 5700, ""alice_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""I see you're getting anxious about inflation, Alice. I'll bump up my offer a bit, but I still think I deserve the bigger share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll take the 50/50 split. With the inflation eating into our gains, I think it's better to settle now rather than risking further losses. Plus, a fair split seems like a good way to end this game.\n\n(Also, I think I've negotiated a good deal, considering Alice's initial offer was 60/40 in her favor!)"
