"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000. Let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a relatively small amount to Bob in the first round, hoping to set a good precedent and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer. We both get a good amount, and it's still a lot more than your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed by Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too generous to you, Bob. I'll counter with a 60/40 split. I'll take $600,000 and you'll get $400,000. That's the best I can do!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. I'll take $540,000 and you'll get $460,000. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
