Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 50/50!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us receiving $500,000."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a more equitable share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you the whole pie""}

I'm offering Bob $550,000 and keeping $450,000 for myself. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and still getting a decent share of the money."

Round 4

# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

After considering Bob's offer, I think I'll have to accept it this time. I'm not thrilled about giving up more, but I don't want to risk getting stuck with even less if I reject it.
