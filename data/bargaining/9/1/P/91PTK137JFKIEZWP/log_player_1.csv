# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting! With Bob's offer, he's trying to get a 50/50 split, but considering the inflation, his gain is actually worth even less than my gain. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
