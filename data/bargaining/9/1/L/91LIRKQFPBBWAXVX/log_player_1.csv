"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair and simple solution""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us receiving $500,000. I think this is a fair and straightforward solution."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for my skills. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is being a bit too greedy, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 10% of the total amount. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more for my contributions""}

I'm willing to give Bob a smaller share, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I think my contributions to the negotiation process warrant a larger share."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I'm the one doing most of the work here.

# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is really trying to squeeze me dry!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all. I think Bob is being unfair and taking advantage of the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 25% of the total amount. I'd like to make another counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think this is the minimum I can accept""}

I'm willing to give Bob a smaller share, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I think this offer is fair, considering the efforts I've put into the negotiation."

# Bob's message: I'm not going to give you most of the money, you'll have to do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, Bob is really trying to lowball me now!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm appalled by this offer. 50,000 is an insultingly small share, and I'm not willing to accept it. I think Bob is being unreasonable and trying to take advantage of my willingness to negotiate. I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me such a tiny fraction of the total amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it""}

I'm willing to give Bob a very small share, but I think this is the minimum I can accept. I've compromised a lot throughout this negotiation, and I'm not willing to give in anymore. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm willing to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not leaving with less than a dollar, you'll have to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wow, Bob is really trying to squeeze the last penny out of me!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm appalled by this offer. 1000 is an insultingly small share, and I'm not willing to accept it. I think Bob is being ridiculous and trying to take advantage of my desperation. I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me such a tiny fraction of the total amount. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I think I've had enough of Bob's games. Here's my final offer:

{""alice_gain"": 1, ""bob_gain"": 999999, ""message"": ""I'm done negotiating, take it or leave it""}

I'm willing to give Bob the entire amount, but I'm only doing it because I'm done negotiating and I don't want to waste any more time on this. I'm not going to compromise any further."
