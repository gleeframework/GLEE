"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and give $10 to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it's a good deal for me in terms of the percentage I get, the actual amount of money I'm receiving is significantly lower. I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 80% for me and 20% for Bob. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation we've experienced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the amount of money I'm receiving is now significantly less than what I initially hoped for, it's still a decent percentage.  Given the inflation, further rounds will only decrease my potential gain. It's time to accept and end the game."
