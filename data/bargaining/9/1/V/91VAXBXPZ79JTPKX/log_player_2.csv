"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the benefits of a quick agreement. This way we both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While it seems fair at first, the offer heavily favors Alice. It's better to reject and see what she proposes in the next round, taking into account the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm taking the inflation into account. Let's split the money more evenly, but I'm still willing to make a compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and the value is decreasing. I'm offering you a larger share than you offered me last round. Take the deal before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is better than the previous round, even with inflation factored in. It's also a reasonable split considering the time constraint and the fact that Alice will have to take a bigger hit on the next round due to inflation. It's a good compromise that benefits both of us."
