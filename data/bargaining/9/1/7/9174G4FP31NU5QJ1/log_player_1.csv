# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate, but his offer still isn't favorable enough. He's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation. I'll hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you a very favorable split, considering it's my turn.  Take this deal and let's end this before we both lose out! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob is correct that his offer is surprisingly generous considering it's his turn, it's still cutting into my potential gains significantly.  The inflation is hurting him more than me, and I'm willing to gamble that he'll become more desperate in the next couple of rounds."

# Bob gain: 490000
