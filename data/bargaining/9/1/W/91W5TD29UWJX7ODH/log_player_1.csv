Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money.  This is my final offer.  It's much more than you've offered me, and it's the best chance we have to get anything at all. Take it or we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough situation. Ideally, we want Bob to feel the pressure and offer a higher amount. However, Bob seems to be playing a very stubborn game, likely realizing that Alice is more impacted by the time pressure. 

While getting $20 is significantly less than desired, it's better than getting $0, which is the guaranteed outcome if we continue to reject Bob's offers."
