"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I'm aiming for the majority of the money in this first round. While I want to be fair, it's important to remember that the money will be worth less with each passing round.  

This offer gives Bob a small portion, but it's enough to potentially incentivize him to accept, rather than risk getting nothing at all if he rejects and the money loses value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer gives me a small amount, it's significantly less than what I proposed in the first round.  Furthermore, the money is now worth 20% less to me due to inflation. This makes his offer even less appealing. I'll reject it and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer this round for two reasons:

1. **Inflation:** The value of the money has decreased by 20% since the first round. 
2. **Negotiation:** I need to be more flexible to secure a deal.  While I still aim for a larger share, I'm willing to compromise to avoid further potential losses from inflation. 

This offer still gives me a significant portion of the money, but it's more balanced than my initial proposal.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise, given the circumstances."
