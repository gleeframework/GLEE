I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I want to see how Bob reacts and if he's willing to accept a smaller share in the early rounds.  I think I can use the inflation to my advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round.  While I am losing a large amount of money, the inflation is cutting into my gains more than Bob's. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get some money."
