  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob! I'll give you a slightly larger share this time.""

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob! I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting any younger!""

```
{

}
```
