```

  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not sure it's fair 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next proposal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not good enough, I'll make a better offer""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, my next offer will be more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share""
}
```

This way, I'll get $55 and Bob will get $45, a slightly more skewed split in my favor."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll have to consider this offer carefully. Meeting in the middle at 50-50 seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can finalize the deal."
