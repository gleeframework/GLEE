"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a slightly larger share since the money devalues faster for me. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the devaluation of money for me.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time, considering the devaluation impact on me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the devaluation is significant for you. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 487500 
# Alice gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nThe offer doesn't compensate enough for the increasing devaluation of money on my side. I'll wait for the next round to make another proposal.\n\n###\n\nAlso, note that the current offer of $487,500 for me is actually worth less than that due to inflation, making it even less favorable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nConsidering the growing impact of inflation, I'll adjust my offer to balance the devaluation effect.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing devaluation, I believe a slightly larger share for me is fair to compensate for the loss in value over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose if this drags on. This offer is a win-win, reflecting the time value of money for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 495000 
# Alice gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation, accepting this offer seems more beneficial than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. The difference in our gains is relatively small, and prolonging the game would likely result in a worse outcome for me due to the increasing devaluation of money on my side."
