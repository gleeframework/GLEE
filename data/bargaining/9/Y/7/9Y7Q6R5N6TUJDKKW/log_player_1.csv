"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think strategically.

I'll reject this offer because it's not in my favor. If I accept, I'll get $40, but if I reject and make a proposal in the next round, I might be able to get more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal this time.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
