Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This feels like a fair starting point, given the inflation dynamic will work more in Bob's favor in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take effect, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the changing value of the money."
