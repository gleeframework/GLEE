Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's not generous, Alice. How about this - you get a third, and I get the rest before inflation hits us both? 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
