"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. You can't complain about 70%! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 30% that Bob is offering himself. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, Bob. I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I need more for myself.""
}
```

I'm increasing my demand to 80% of the remaining $100, and offering Bob only 20%. I'm framing it as a reasonable compromise, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, Alice. But I'm not going to give away the farm. You're getting a good deal, so take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my offer's value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. 75% of the remaining $100 is a decent deal, and I don't want to risk going to another round and losing even more value due to inflation."
