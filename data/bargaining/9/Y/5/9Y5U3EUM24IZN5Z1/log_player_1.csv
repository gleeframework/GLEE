"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 3:1 ratio, giving you 2500 dollars. This ensures I have a larger share while still providing you with a fair portion.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think 3:1 is too skewed. Let's try a 2:1 ratio instead. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
