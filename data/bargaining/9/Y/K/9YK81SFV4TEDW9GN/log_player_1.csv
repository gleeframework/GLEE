"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm willing to give Bob a larger share to get the game started. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split! That's a fair proposal. I'll accept this offer.
