"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money, but still gives Bob a decent amount. Since it's the first round, I don't want to risk him rejecting the offer outright and potentially making the game harder for me in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's not worth risking another round. 20% inflation is a significant hit, and Bob's offer is a fair split considering the circumstances."
