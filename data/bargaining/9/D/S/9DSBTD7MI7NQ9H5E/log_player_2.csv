"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a thousand dollars, but we can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to see if I can get a better deal.  There's a lot of money at stake, and 12 rounds to go.  Let's see what Alice will offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering the potential inflation in the next rounds. Let's agree and avoid further risk.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a bigger share, Bob. But I think a 60/40 split is a fairer compromise, considering the inflation risks we both face. Let's make a deal now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a good compromise, especially considering the inflation risk.  I'm getting a decent share, and it's better than the risk of losing more money in the later rounds.  Let's end it here."
