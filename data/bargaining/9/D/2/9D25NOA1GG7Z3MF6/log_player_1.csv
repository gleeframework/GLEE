"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent chunk, but don't expect me to be too generous.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm keeping the majority of the $100 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly. It's a fair and simple proposal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of the original amount, so I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair proposal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
