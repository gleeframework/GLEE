Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $80 in the next round. I'll propose a division that gives me a smaller share, but still a decent one.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $64 in the next round. Alice's offer is equivalent to $45.6 in the next round. I'll think carefully...
