Let's see if Bob is happy with a slightly bigger share!"

Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Let's try an even split this time.  Perhaps Bob is feeling generous after getting rejected!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Even though it's less than I wanted initially, the inflation is getting out of hand, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
