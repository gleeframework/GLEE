"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

This is a fair starting offer, giving Alice a slightly larger share to account for the faster inflation rate she faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it does offer me more than the previous round, it still undervalues my share due to the faster inflation rate I face. I'll wait to see what Bob's next offer is."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm increasing my share slightly to compensate for the continuing inflation. This offer still keeps the division relatively fair, accounting for our differing inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, this offer is better for me than my last offer. It also represents a return to a more even split, which I find acceptable given the circumstances."
