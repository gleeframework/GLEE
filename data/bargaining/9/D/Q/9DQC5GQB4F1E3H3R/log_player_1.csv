"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount to start with, and I'll take the majority of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 90/10 split is fair, given the time constraint. We can discuss further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain from Bob's offer are:

* My gain: 1000 / 0.95 = 1053.16 (since my gain is worth 5% less due to inflation)
* Bob's gain: 9000 / 0.9 = 10000 (since Bob's gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, but his offer is already 90% of the total, so it's not affected by the inflation rate)

I'm not too thrilled about the 90/10 split, but I don't want to waste time. I'll accept the offer.
