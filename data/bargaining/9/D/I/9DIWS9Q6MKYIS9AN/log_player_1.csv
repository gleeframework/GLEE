"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. The money is worth 5% less now, so I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

}

I'm offering to take $5,500 and leaving $4,500 for Bob."
