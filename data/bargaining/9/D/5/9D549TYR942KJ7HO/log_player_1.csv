"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more balanced split would be fairer, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual values are:

* My gain: 45 * 0.95 = 42.75
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.95 = 52.25

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
