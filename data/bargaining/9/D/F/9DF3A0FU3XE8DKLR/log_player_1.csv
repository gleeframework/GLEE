"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation. However, Bob's offer is now worth 10% less to him compared to the first round.

Considering this, I'll make a decision. I'll...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 6000 for him and 4000 for me, I'll try to adjust the numbers to make a more favorable offer for myself. I'll aim to get a bit more than 4000, but not too much to be unfair.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze Bob's offer again. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation. However, Bob's offer is now worth 27.1% less to him compared to the first round.

Considering this, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since it's still a bit more favorable to him than my previous offer, I'll...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 5500 for him and 4500 for me, I'll try to adjust the numbers again to make a more favorable offer for myself. I'll aim to get a bit more than 4500, but not too much to be unfair.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
