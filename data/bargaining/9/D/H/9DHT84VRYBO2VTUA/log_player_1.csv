I'm going for a slightly unfair but not overly greedy approach. I'm confident Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'll have the opportunity to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I'm going for a fair split this time. Bob was very greedy in the previous round, and this should be a more reasonable offer that he's likely to accept."
