"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a 60/40 split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to settle for a 40% share right off the bat. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation disadvantage you'll face in the next round. Let's be reasonable and end this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, since inflation is starting to affect us both.  It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I would have preferred my previous proposal,  the inflation is starting to hurt, and a 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
