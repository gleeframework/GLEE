"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I take most of the money but give you a decent start. Accept and we both move on, reject and see what happens next. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to take $100,000, rejecting gives me the chance to potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the value of money decreases each round.  Accept and we both get a good chunk, reject and risk losing more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but I still think I deserve the larger share.  Accept and we both get a good deal, reject and we both risk losing more in the future. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd ideally want more, the value of money is decreasing rapidly for me with each round.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial amount, and rejecting risks losing even more in the next round."
