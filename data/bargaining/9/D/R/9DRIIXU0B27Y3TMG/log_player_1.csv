Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $1,000 and keep $9,000 for myself. I'm taking a risk by starting with a high offer, but I figure that will give me a better chance of getting a good deal in the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more of the money, given the inflation and limited rounds, accepting this offer is the best option. It's a fair split and ensures we both receive something."
