"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of 5000 in this round is equivalent to 6000 in the first round, which is a better offer than my initial one.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
