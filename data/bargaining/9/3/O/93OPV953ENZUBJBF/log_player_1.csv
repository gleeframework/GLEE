"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, but I'm keeping most of the money for myself.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, as the inflation will hurt him more in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a much better offer than the previous one.  While I would like to have more, it's getting too risky to keep rejecting offers.  It's best to take what I can now before inflation makes it even worse."
