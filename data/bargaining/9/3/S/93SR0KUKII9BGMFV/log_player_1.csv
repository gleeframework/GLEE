"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but leaves Bob with something to consider. I believe it's a fair starting point, and if Bob rejects it, the inflation will work in my favor in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, Bob's offer still gives me a significant portion of the money, and with inflation, it's unlikely I can get a better deal in the next round."
