"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you $100k and take the rest. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and taking the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $475,000.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... Splitting the money evenly sounds fair, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

For now, I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $300k and take the rest. It's a fair compromise.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I suggest we divide the money into a 60/40 ratio, which I believe is more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 86.6% of its original value, which is $346,400.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but a 60/40 ratio does seem more favorable to Bob than the 50/50 split he suggested earlier. I'll consider it...

For now, I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.
