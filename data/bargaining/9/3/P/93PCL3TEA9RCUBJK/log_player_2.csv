Round 5

# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to pressure me into accepting an unfair deal. While the amount offered is getting better, I still believe I have leverage. There are several rounds left, and Alice doesn't want to walk away with nothing."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both being stubborn. Let's be reasonable and split it 75/25.  Accept this, and we can both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is trying to disguise her previous offer as a ""reasonable"" compromise.  She's clearly feeling the pressure of the dwindling rounds. I need to hold my ground a little longer to secure a better deal."

Round 9

# Alice's message: Bob, we're both getting a bit carried away. Let's be rational and split it 65/35. It's a fair compromise, and we'll both get a good amount.  Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is getting ridiculous! Alice is just repeating the previous round's offer but trying to make it seem like a compromise.  We are running out of time, but I need to make it clear I won't be swayed by her tactics."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10

Round 11
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're down to the wire. Let's agree to a 60/40 split. It's the best we can do at this point.  Accept this, and we can both walk away with a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's risky, but we are down to the final rounds. Alice has been consistently rejecting anything less favorable to her than the 60/40 split. This is the last chance to secure any deal at all. If I reject this, we both walk away with nothing."
