"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly evenly, with a slight bias towards you for being the one who proposed first.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more for making the first proposal. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

Considering the decreased value of the money, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'd like a slightly larger share to compensate for the reduced purchasing power.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.
