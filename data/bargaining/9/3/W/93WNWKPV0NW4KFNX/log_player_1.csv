"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $450,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, due to the 10% inflation. Still, it's a decent offer.
