"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount is $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor this time, and we can work towards a more equitable solution next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll consider the actual amount I'd gain in this round.

In this round, the actual amount I'd gain is 400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000.

Considering the offer, I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal. I don't want to give up 60% of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain in this round.

In this round, the actual amount I'd gain is 320,000 * 0.8 = 256,000.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll try to be more aggressive in my proposal to compensate for the loss.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation. Let's aim for a more balanced split this time.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor this time.  I think we can both come out ahead if we keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less now, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain in this round.

In this round, the actual amount I'd gain is 256,000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 131,936.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 45% of the remaining money, but I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation more and more.

I'll try to be cautious and see if I can get a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less again, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain in this round.

In this round, the actual amount I'd gain is 131,936 * 0.516 = 67,931.

Considering the offer, I'll be more aggressive in my proposal to try to get a better deal.

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
