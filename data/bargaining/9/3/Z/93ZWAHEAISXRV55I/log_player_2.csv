It's tempting to accept, but let's see if I can get a better deal.  I'll propose next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the devaluation, this offer is more realistic. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still offering a significantly larger share for herself, and the inflation is starting to bite.  I'll try to propose a more even split in the next round."
