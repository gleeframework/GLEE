"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing quickly!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 7000 * 0.9 = 6300
Bob gain: 3000 * 0.9 = 2700

I'll accept Bob's offer.
