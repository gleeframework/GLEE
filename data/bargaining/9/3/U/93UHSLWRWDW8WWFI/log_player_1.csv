Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money, as I know the value will decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 60/40 split isn't ideal, it's better than losing even more due to inflation. I'll take it."
