"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice

I'll propose a division that gives me a bit more, but still seems reasonable for Bob to accept, considering the inflation penalty for further rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Fair share, considering the risk of inflation.""
}
```

### 

Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We can both benefit more if we avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice

Considering the offer and the impact of inflation, I'll decide whether to accept or reject Bob's proposal.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice

Given that we're in the third round and the money's value is decreasing, I'll make an offer that still favors me but takes into account the decreasing value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5250,
  ""bob_gain"": 4750,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's compromise to minimize loss.""
}
```

Let's see how Bob responds!"
