"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! You'll get 10% of the original amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the risk of inflation reducing the value of the money."
