6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000 and keep $6000. We can negotiate from here.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's work together to get the most out of this money.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is still too skewed towards you. I'll offer 55/45 in my favor, but I'll give you a slightly better deal: $4500 for me and $4500 for you.",Alice,3,
