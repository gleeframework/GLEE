"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  The clock is ticking and the money is losing value, more so for you.  Take this deal and we both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
