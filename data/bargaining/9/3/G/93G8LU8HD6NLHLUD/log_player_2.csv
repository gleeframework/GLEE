"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's initial offer was 50/50, I'll try to take a slightly larger share this round to account for the inflation. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my share of $45 in round 3 is equivalent to $45 / 0.9075 = $49.60 in round 1 terms. This is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a good deal. I'll accept Alice's offer.
