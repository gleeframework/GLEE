Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by proposing a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the money quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, with inflation kicking in, it's better to secure some money than risk getting nothing."
