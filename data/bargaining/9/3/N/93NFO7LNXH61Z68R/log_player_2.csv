Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. 55-45 seems fair, given the decreasing value affects you more. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

```

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game goes on, the more Bob loses due to the higher inflation rate. Delaying further significantly eats into his potential gains.
* **Offer Improvement:**  Alice has moved closer to a more balanced split, recognizing the inflation disparity. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a risk.  There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might even lower her offer, putting Bob in a weaker position.

Accepting the 45/55 split secures a reasonable sum for Bob, even with the inflation effect, and avoids the risk of ending up with a worse deal later.
