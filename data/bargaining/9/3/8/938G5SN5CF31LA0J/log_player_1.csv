Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it evenly. 50/50 is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Inflation is eating away at the value, so let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

Even though I could try for a slightly better outcome in later rounds, accepting a 50/50 split now is a safe bet.  With inflation, delaying the decision only makes the potential gains smaller."
