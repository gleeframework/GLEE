"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's see if Bob agrees""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to wait for the next round 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think meeting in the middle is a good idea, and we can wrap up the game quickly."
