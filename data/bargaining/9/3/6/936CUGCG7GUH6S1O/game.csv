4500.0,5500.0,"Your split seems a bit too much in your favor, especially considering the inflation. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a starting point for negotiation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer doesn't reflect the rate at which your share is devaluing. I'm proposing 58/42, it's a compromise considering the time pressure.",Alice,3,
