"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm setting the tone for a reasonable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  This way we both get a decent amount and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I'd get $63 (70 x 0.9) if I accept Bob's offer.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 63% of the original value (70 x 0.9 x 0.9). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""You said let's be fair in your last offer, but it was 50/50. I'll give you a bit less than that.""
}
```"
