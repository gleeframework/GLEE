I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although I was hoping for a better deal, I think 45 dollars is a decent amount considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is offering a slightly higher share this time. I'll take the 45 dollars and end the game."
