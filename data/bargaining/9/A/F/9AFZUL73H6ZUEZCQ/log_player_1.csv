"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll get $5,000, which is worth 95% of the initial $5,250 (since 5% of $5,250 is $262.50).

Similarly, Bob will get $5,000, which is worth 80% of the initial $6,250 (since 20% of $6,250 is $1,250).

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is a good one for me. I'll accept Bob's offer.
