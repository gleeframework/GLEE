"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100, and Bob gets the remaining 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is now 50-50, I'll accept it.
