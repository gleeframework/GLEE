"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This way, we both get an equal share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to think carefully about the offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if I want to accept it.

I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a larger share this time. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up. My gain is worth significantly less now.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I think I have to be careful not to let the game drag on too long. I'll accept this offer to get some money, even though it's not ideal.
