"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000. This ensures I get the most possible in this round, knowing that the money will be worth less next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, the inflation will significantly devalue the money if I reject this offer. Accepting this offer guarantees me $6,000, which is better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
