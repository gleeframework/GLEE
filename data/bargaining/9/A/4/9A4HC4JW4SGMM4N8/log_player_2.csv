"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good offer considering the inflation, think about it! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what I can get with my own proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the inflation, and I think it's more equitable than your previous proposal.  Let's end this game on a good note.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money keeps shrinking! My last offer was already generous, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 58/42 and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is a serious factor, and this offer is better than what I'd get if I reject and try again. Let's end this!"
