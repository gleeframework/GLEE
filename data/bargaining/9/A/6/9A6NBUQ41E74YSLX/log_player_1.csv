"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you can do better. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $6000
* Bob gain: $4000

I'll reject this offer since it's not as good as my previous offer, and I'm hoping to do better. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,

}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to accept a 2:1 ratio. I think we can do better than this. Let's try to find a more equal split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5,120 (calculated as $10,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $5,120)
* Bob gain: $5,120

I'll accept this offer since it's a 50/50 split, which is more equal than my previous offer.
