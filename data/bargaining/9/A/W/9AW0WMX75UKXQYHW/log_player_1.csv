"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start with a fair split!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for a fair negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take $300,000 and Bob will take $700,000."
