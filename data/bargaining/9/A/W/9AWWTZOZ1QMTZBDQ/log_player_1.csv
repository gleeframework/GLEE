"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split with a 60-40 ratio.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer. If he rejects, I'll wait for his counteroffer. If he accepts, we can conclude the game here.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to clarify, I considered the effects of inflation in my offer, trying to find a balance that would be acceptable to both of us, given the decreasing value of money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60-40 split in my favor this time. It's a fair deal, considering inflation will hit you harder. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe the split is too favorable to Bob. Given the decreasing value of money, I'm willing to negotiate further to find a more balanced division.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to slightly adjust my initial offer. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to slightly adjust my initial offer. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.""}\n\n###\n\nI've already considered the effects of inflation in my offer from the previous round, so I'll stick with the same proposal for now. Please let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\nIf Bob rejects, I'll reassess the situation and make a new offer in the next round, taking into account the further decrease in the value of money."
