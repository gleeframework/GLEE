"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This allows me to keep more value while still providing Bob with a portion. I believe this is fair given the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share now to ensure I get a higher absolute amount as the money devalues over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob accepted my previous offer, I propose a 72/28 split. This maintains a reasonable difference in our shares while acknowledging the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5, ""message"": ""I'm taking a smaller share now to minimize the impact of inflation on my gain, but I'm willing to compromise on a smaller share for myself to ensure a better absolute value in the end.""}"
