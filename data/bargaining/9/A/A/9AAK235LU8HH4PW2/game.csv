80.0,20.0,I propose dividing the $100 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This allows me to keep more value while still providing Bob with a portion. I believe this is fair given the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
10.0,90.0,I'll take a smaller share now to ensure I get a higher absolute amount as the money devalues over time.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
72.0,28.0,"Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob accepted my previous offer, I propose a 72/28 split. This maintains a reasonable difference in our shares while acknowledging the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5.0,95.0,"I'm taking a smaller share now to minimize the impact of inflation on my gain, but I'm willing to compromise on a smaller share for myself to ensure a better absolute value in the end.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
