40.0,60.0,"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'd like to propose a more even split.  Let's try 60/40 with me getting the larger share this time.  It's a small difference, but I think it's fair considering we both have the opportunity to make counter-offers.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Okay Bob, let's try this.  How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  It's a bit closer to the middle ground, and we're losing money with each round due to inflation.",Alice,3,
