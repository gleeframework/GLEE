450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's compromise. I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is still more in your favor, but lets us both get closer to an agreement.",Bob,4,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing a significant chunk of money. This is my final offer: $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you. It's a fair split considering the different inflation rates. Let's be smart and close this deal now.",Alice,5,
