"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's 30-70 split. I was hoping for a more balanced split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle with a 50-50 split, considering the inflation effect""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to find a compromise that takes into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation. I hope Bob will consider this offer and we can finally reach an agreement."
