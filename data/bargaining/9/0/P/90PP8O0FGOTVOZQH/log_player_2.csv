**Reasoning:**

While the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, accepting an unfair deal this early sets a bad precedent. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation, hoping I'll panic as the rounds progress.  I'll hold out for a better offer, as accepting anything less than 50/50 at this stage is a loss for me in the long run."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but this needs to be reasonable. Time is running out for both of us.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. I'll give you a little, but I'm not going below this. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on. While this offer isn't ideal, rejecting it means risking an even worse outcome in later rounds as the inflation eats away at my potential gains.  It's better to secure something now than hold out for an unlikely improvement and potentially end up with nothing."
