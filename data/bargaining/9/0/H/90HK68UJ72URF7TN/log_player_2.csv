Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted,  the inflation is becoming a huge problem.  It's better to take what I can now before the value drops even further."
