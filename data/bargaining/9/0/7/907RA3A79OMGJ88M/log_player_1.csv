Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly."

Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is the same as mine in the first round, but now it's his turn. I'll reject it since I'm hoping to get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate. Here's my new offer:

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I'll try to get a larger share now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000

# Bob gain: 6000
