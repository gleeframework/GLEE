Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer. I want to secure as much of the money as possible before inflation kicks in.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more,  the inflation is starting to bite, and this is a decent share.  It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing in the next round."
