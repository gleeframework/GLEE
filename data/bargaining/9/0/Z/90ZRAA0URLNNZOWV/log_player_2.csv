"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront, but we both avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round. The 5% inflation hit isn't too bad, and I'm hoping Alice will be more generous next time around. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take on the risk of inflation, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. Let's split it with a slight bias towards me this time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting us both. Let's be reasonable. This offer ensures we both get a decent share before it shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think this is a reasonable offer, considering the effects of inflation. Alice is right, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and it's better to secure a decent share now rather than risking further devaluation. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game here."
