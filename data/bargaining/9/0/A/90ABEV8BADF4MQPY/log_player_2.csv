"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to account for the faster inflation rate I experience. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a more balanced 55/45 split. This considers the inflation we both face, but recognizes that you are impacted more heavily in the later rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer still accounts for the shrinking pot, and it's better for you than what I'll propose in Round 4. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
