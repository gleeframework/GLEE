"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60%, leaving you with 40%.  Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's aggressive proposal, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob was quite aggressive last time, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

I'm proposing that I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500. I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to 50/50, but still gives me a slight advantage."
