Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer. Here's my proposal for Round 2:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the effect of inflation on Alice's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Alice's money is worth 36% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

My initial reaction is that this offer seems relatively generous from Alice's perspective, considering the inflation. However, I'll stick with my initial proposal from Round 2, which was 60-40. Given the inflation, I'll make a slight adjustment to my proposal to account for the changing values.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and Alice's previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share.

{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}"
