I propose that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I'm hoping to get a majority of the money, but I want to be fair enough that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $4,500 this time. This is a compromise, and it's more fair than his previous offer. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement."
