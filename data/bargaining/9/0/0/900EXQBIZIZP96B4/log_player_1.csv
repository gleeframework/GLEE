"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that, let's try 80/20. It's still a good deal for you, and I get a bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
