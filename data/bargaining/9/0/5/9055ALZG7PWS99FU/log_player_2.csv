"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair deal, considering I'm taking the risk of being the first to offer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's risky to accept a 90/10 split right away, especially with the threat of inflation.  I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a more balanced split. I'm offering 60% for me and 40% for you.  We can work towards a more agreeable number in the following rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe a 55/45 split is fair. It's closer to my initial proposal, and considering the inflation, it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While the initial 90/10 split was unacceptable, a 55/45 split is a more reasonable compromise, especially considering the inflation factor.  It's a better outcome than my previous offer and avoids the risk of further rounds and potentially even worse deals due to inflation."
