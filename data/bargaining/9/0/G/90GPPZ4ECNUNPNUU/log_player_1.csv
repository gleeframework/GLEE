"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's start with a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 20% less now, so my initial offer was actually a bit generous.

I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% decrease in value:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a bit more. What do you say?""
}
```"
