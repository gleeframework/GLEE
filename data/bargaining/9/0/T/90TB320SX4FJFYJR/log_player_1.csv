"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, given we have limited time. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I need to adjust my thinking. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'm effectively getting 57.5% of the original amount, while Bob is getting 55% of the original amount, which is a more favorable split for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
