"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a reasonable base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the potential for inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think he's trying to take advantage of the inflation and get a larger share of the money. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share due to my initial proposal being rejected""}

I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer, taking into account that Bob's initial proposal was rejected, and I'm willing to give him a slightly larger share than my initial proposal. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
