{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer is a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping to demonstrate flexibility and encourage a quicker resolution."

# Bob gain: 600000

I'm still not happy with this offer. While it's a significant increase from his last offer, it's still not close to what I believe I deserve. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better outcome in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm lowering my offer again, but still maintaining a significant lead over Bob's last offer. I believe this shows I'm willing to compromise, while still holding out for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still too low. While the difference between our gains is narrowing, it's not enough to be considered a fair compromise. I'm prepared to keep negotiating for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm now proposing a more equal split, recognizing that we are nearing the end of the game and the value of the money is declining rapidly. This offer reflects a willingness to compromise, but I still believe I should receive a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only a few rounds left, the value of the money is declining rapidly. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer at least guarantees me half of the remaining value. It's a fair split and a better outcome than potentially getting nothing."
