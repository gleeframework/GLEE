"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Your turn! I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic about the time value of money.  This offer is only better than waiting one more round.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding the Game:** This is a classic game theory scenario where delaying an agreement leads to a shrinking pie.  It's in both players' best interests to reach a deal quickly.
* **Leveraging the Discount:** By offering slightly more than Alice would get by waiting one more round (400,000 * 0.95 = 380,000), I'm making it very tempting for her to accept. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** My message aims to make the offer seem fair while still emphasizing the cost of delay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's split the difference, I'm being more than fair considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation around a 60/40 split in her favor.  While she's making a small concession due to inflation, it's not enough.  I need to signal that I'm willing to wait for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Alice!  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. Let's not lose any more to inflation."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Power of a Strong Anchor:** By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm establishing a new reference point for the negotiation.  Even if Alice rejects this, it becomes harder for her to justify anything significantly less favorable to me in future rounds.
* **Highlighting the Cost of Delay:**  The message reinforces the idea that every round of delay erodes the value of their potential winnings. 
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair, making it more difficult for Alice to argue against without appearing greedy."
