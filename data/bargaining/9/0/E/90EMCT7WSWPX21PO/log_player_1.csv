"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my potential gain of 70 is actually worth 56 (70 * 0.8) in terms of purchasing power.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. I'd like to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 80% of its original value now (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I need a decent amount to make up for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to get a decent share 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my potential gain of 75 is actually worth 37.5 (75 * 0.5) in terms of purchasing power.

I'll reject Bob's offer again, as I'd like to get a better deal. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 50.4% of its original value now (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512). I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the decreasing value.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I need a significant share to keep up with inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my potential gain of 65 is actually worth 21.7 (65 * 0.332) in terms of purchasing power.

I'll reject Bob's offer again, as I'd like to get a better deal. I'm getting desperate, but I still want to maximize my gain.
