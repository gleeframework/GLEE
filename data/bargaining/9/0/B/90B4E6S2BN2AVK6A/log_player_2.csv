"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob.  While it's tempting to get something,  the money is almost entirely going to Alice, and it's only round 1.  There's a good chance Bob can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
Let's see if Alice is willing to take a smaller share.  This gives Bob a much larger share, and since Alice gets nothing if we don't reach an agreement in 12 rounds, she may be willing to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is better than round 1, Alice is still taking a large majority of the money. It's still early in the game, and there's a chance Bob can secure a more equitable deal later.  Inflation is working in Bob's favor, as the money is becoming less valuable to Alice, and the game is nearing its end."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

This is a 50/50 split, which is the fairest way to divide the money.  It is also a good strategy for Bob as he is likely to lose money with each passing round due to inflation."
