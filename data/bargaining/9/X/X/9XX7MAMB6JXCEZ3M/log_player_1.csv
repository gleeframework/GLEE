I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $90 and Bob getting $10. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I am the one making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm going to try to get closer to an even split. I'll offer 80 for me and 20 for Bob.  I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to give up too much."
