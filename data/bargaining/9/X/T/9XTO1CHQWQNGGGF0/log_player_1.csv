"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave 20% for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $4000 is now worth 95% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $6000 is now worth 90% of its original value.

Considering the compromise, I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable split, and I'd rather not risk going to another round with further inflation.
