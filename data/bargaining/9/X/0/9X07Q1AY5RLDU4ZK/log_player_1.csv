"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 

This is a fair starting point, offering a slightly larger share to myself as the proposer.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, even taking inflation into account. I'm going to reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm proposing a 50/50 split this time.  This seems like a fair and reasonable solution, and with inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, it might be in Bob's best interest to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the significant inflation, Bob's offer is now better than my last proposal. Accepting this ensures I get a portion of the money, as we are already nearing the end of the game.  It's a bit less than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to compromise."
