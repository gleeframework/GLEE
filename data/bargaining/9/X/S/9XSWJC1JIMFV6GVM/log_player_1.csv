``` 

This is a tough situation. Here's why I'm accepting, even though it's less than ideal:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The 67.23% inflation means I'm losing a huge chunk of value with every round that passes. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out hope for a slightly better deal in later rounds isn't worth the risk of getting even less.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems fixated on his advantage. It's unlikely he'll offer anything significantly better as long as he knows the inflation is working in his favor. 

While 40 is much lower than I'd like, it's better to secure something now than risk ending up with nothing."
