"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer. I'm ready to proceed to the next round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a more balanced split. Let's start from a more equal footing. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I need to consider the decreased value in my decision. With that in mind, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Please let me know when it's my turn again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 58-42?""}"
