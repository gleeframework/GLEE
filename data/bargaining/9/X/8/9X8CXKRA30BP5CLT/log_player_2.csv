Let's see if Alice is feeling generous!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 510000 
# Alice gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Alice's offer is getting better, and I'm not sure how much longer we can keep playing before the inflation hits me harder. I'll take the 510,000."
