"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since I'll get only 30% of the remaining value, I'll have to be strategic.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll try to do better next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is taking a toll on my offer. Here's my new proposal, taking into account the 20% decrease in value:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share to try to get a deal done."
