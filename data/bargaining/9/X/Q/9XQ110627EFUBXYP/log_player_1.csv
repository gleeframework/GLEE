I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  I'll keep a large share for myself since the money is worth less to him.  Let's see if he takes the bait!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 88 
# Bob gain: 12 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still pretty good, especially considering the inflation.  Accepting now means I'll get a decent share, and I don't want to risk losing more in future rounds."
