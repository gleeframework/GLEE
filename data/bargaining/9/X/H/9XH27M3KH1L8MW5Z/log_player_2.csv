"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 90% and leave you 10%.  Let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's a very unfair offer, and I have no reason to believe it'll get better in the next round. I'll make my own offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly. I'm offering you 40% - it's a good deal, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiations.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to 60% but that's my final offer. If we keep going, we'll both be losing money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is more reasonable than her first one. Accepting now prevents further losses from inflation."
