"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm proposing a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as thrilled with Bob's offer as I was with mine. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even lower value of money.

I accept this offer.
