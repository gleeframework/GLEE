"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. 1000 dollars is not a good deal, especially considering the inflation. I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Alice 4000 dollars and taking 6000 for myself. This feels like a fair split considering the inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'd still prefer more, with the inflation, I'm worried about getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers. 4000 is a decent amount, and I'm not sure I can do much better."
