"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. I'm aiming to get the majority of the money, knowing that the value will decrease faster for him than for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him, but still leaves a lot of money on the table. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation affects him more. I'll aim for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This offer is more balanced than my previous one, recognizing that Bob is experiencing a higher rate of inflation. I'm aiming for a more equitable split while still securing a larger share."
