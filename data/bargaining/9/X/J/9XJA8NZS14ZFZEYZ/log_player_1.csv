"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed later.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can discuss and adjust the split as we go along."
