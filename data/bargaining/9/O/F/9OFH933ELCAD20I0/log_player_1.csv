"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll get a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair to split the money evenly, since I'm taking a bigger hit from the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more balanced split""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to take into account the effects of inflation on both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable proposal."
