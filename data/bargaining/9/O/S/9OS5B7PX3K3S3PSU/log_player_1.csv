"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not getting ripped off! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $40 gain is now worth 90% of the original value, so it's equivalent to $36.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
