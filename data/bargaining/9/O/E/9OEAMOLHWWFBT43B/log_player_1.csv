"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing my gain, I need to be more aggressive to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round. I'll try to take advantage of this and make a more aggressive offer.

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With my gain being worth even less due to inflation, I need to be even more aggressive to get a better deal. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going too low. I'll accept this offer.
