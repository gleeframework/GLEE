Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:2. I'll take 60$, and Bob, you'll take 40$. This maintains a similar ratio to the previous proposal but adjusts for the value loss due to inflation. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
