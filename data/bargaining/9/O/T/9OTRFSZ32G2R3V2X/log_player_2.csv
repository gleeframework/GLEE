"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 99.9% of the money, and you get the remaining 0.1%.  It's a fair deal, right? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible offer!  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think a 90/10 split is fair, with me getting the larger share. After all, I'm the one making the offer this time. Let's be reasonable and end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to 80/20 this time, but I'm not going any lower.  We can keep playing, but the money keeps shrinking with each round.  Think about it. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much better offer than the previous round. I'd rather take 200,000 than risk getting nothing at all."
