"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no more, no less! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $50 in this round is actually worth 90% of what $70 was in the first round, so I'd be getting $63 in real terms.

I'm not sure I'm willing to meet Bob in the middle, especially since I'm getting a slightly smaller share in real terms due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further. Can you offer a bit more?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain of $63 in the previous round is now worth 90% of what $50 was in the previous round, so I'd be getting $45.9 in real terms. To account for this, I'll make a new offer that takes into consideration the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value of money, I'm willing to offer a 55-45 split. Your turn!""
}
```"
