"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can call it a day."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the higher share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $5,000 is now worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer of $6,000 for him and $4,000 for me is still a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my $4,000 is now worth even less, so I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to meet in the middle""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, it's a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a better deal with each round. With the inflation, my $5,500 is now worth significantly less, and I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, meeting in the middle might be a good compromise, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept the offer.
