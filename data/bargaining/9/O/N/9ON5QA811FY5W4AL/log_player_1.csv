"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small portion to hopefully encourage him to accept in the first round.  This way, we both get something, and I avoid the risk of inflation affecting my share later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I offered him in the first round.  Even though my offer has been devalued by 10%, I'm not going to accept a 50/50 split when I could potentially get a better deal in the next round.  The risk of inflation still exists, but it's worth the gamble to see if I can get a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly to see if I can incentivize him to accept.  While my offer is still less than what Bob offered me in the previous round, I'm taking into account the risk of inflation and the potential for a better outcome later on.  I'm aiming for a balance between getting a fair share and avoiding too many rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse.  While my share is devalued by 27.1%,  Bob is now trying to get a larger portion.  I'm not willing to accept a deal that leaves me with only 40% of the total, especially with more rounds left.  I need to see if I can get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, hoping to find a middle ground.  While my share is significantly reduced due to inflation,  I'm trying to avoid a situation where both of us get nothing.  This offer should be more attractive to Bob than the previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable. Even with my share being significantly reduced due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives me only 30% of the money.  There are still rounds remaining, and I believe I can secure a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a risky move, but I'm trying to be more aggressive. My share is significantly reduced due to inflation, and I need to secure a deal before it gets worse. I'm hoping Bob will see this offer as more attractive than the previous one, considering his share is increasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly low, even considering the inflation that has devalued my potential gain.  I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me only 20% of the money.  I'm hoping that the pressure of the dwindling rounds will force Bob to offer a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only 3 rounds left, I need to secure a deal. While my share is significantly devalued due to inflation, I'm offering an even split to see if Bob will accept. This is a high-risk move, but it's the best chance I have to get anything at all in the remaining rounds."
