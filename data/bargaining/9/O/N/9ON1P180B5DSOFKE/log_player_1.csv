"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, reflecting my willingness to negotiate. Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll accept Bob's offer for now, but I'll try to do better in the next round.
