"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly favorable to me, split.  I'm willing to negotiate!

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's initial proposal is too heavily skewed in her favor, and I believe we can find a more balanced division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more balanced, taking into account the inflation that affects me. I'll also include a message to Alice explaining my reasoning.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a more even split is possible.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Alice's offer from round 3 because, even though she is trying to compromise, the split is still not balanced considering the inflation that affects me. I'll proceed to the next round to try and find a more favorable division.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and Alice's willingness to compromise. I'll try to find a division that is more balanced and appealing to both of us.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is affecting both of us,  let's split it evenly to avoid further losses.  This is the best for both of us now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Alice's offer from round 5 because, despite the significant impact of inflation on my gain, an even split at this point seems like the most reasonable and mutually beneficial decision to avoid further losses.
