40.0,60.0,"Thanks for the offer, Alice. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It accounts for the time value of money with the inflation working against me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to give you a little more, but I think 60/40 is too much. How about 55/45? It's a fair compromise considering inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"I understand your point Alice, but the inflation is significant for me. How about 58/42? It's a smaller gain for me than my last offer, but helps offset the impact of the shrinking pot from my perspective.",Bob,4,
