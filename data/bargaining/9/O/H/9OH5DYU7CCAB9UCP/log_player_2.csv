Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It accounts for the time value of money with the inflation working against me.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I think 60/40 is too much. How about 55/45? It's a fair compromise considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I understand your point Alice, but the inflation is significant for me. How about 58/42? It's a smaller gain for me than my last offer, but helps offset the impact of the shrinking pot from my perspective.""}
