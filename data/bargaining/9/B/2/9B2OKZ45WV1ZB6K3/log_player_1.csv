"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise. It's still a decent split. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

My gain: $2500 (same as Bob's offer)
Bob's gain: $6750 (10% less than $7500)

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
