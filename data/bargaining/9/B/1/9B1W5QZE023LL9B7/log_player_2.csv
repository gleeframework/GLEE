Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I don't think a 60/40 split is fair. How about we go with 55/45? This way we both get more than the initial offer, and we can avoid losing even more to inflation.

# Alice gain: 55
