40.0,60.0,"Thanks for the offer, Alice. How about we try a 60/40 split? It's important to act fast with inflation eating away at our potential gains.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I don't think a 60/40 split is fair. How about we go with 55/45? This way we both get more than the initial offer, and we can avoid losing even more to inflation.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Okay, Alice, I see your point. Let's settle this quickly. I propose 55/45, with me getting the slightly larger share. Every round costs us money!",Bob,4,
