"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000, with the message ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40."" It's a reasonable offer, and I'm willing to negotiate if Bob doesn't accept it. Since there's no inflation for Bob, he might be willing to hold out for a better deal, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in ending the game early and accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, reflecting the value of my time and effort in this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with the 40-60 split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing for me due to inflation. I think I can do better than that. By rejecting this offer, I'll get a chance to make a new proposal in the next round, and maybe Bob will be more willing to compromise. The fact that Bob is trying to justify his offer by mentioning the value of his time and effort in the negotiation makes me think he's trying to anchor the discussion in his favor, but I'm not buying it. It's time to make a counteroffer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and account for inflation.""}\n\nI'm making a new offer, trying to find a middle ground between our previous proposals. Since the value of the money is decreasing for me, I'm willing to compromise and offer Bob a bit more than I initially wanted to. By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and hoping he'll see this as a reasonable compromise. Fingers crossed!"
