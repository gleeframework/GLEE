"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems generous at first, it's important to remember the inflation factor. Even if I accept, the money will be worth less in the next round. It's better to see what Alice's next offer will be after the inflation kicks in."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more due to the risk of inflation. Accept and let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is offering more than in the first round, my gain is still significantly lower than in my counter-offer, and I'm facing a significant inflation hit.  It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting increasingly worse for me with the inflation, even though she's calling it her final offer.  I'm not desperate enough to accept such a small share.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.

# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still significantly worse for me after inflation. While she's calling it her last chance, I'm not desperate enough to accept such a small share. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
