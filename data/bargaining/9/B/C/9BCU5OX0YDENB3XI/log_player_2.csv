"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take a small piece now, and we can both get more later. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. This is a fair starting point. Let's see what happens.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  We can both avoid any further risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
At this point, inflation is starting to become a serious concern.  Even with the 5% loss, Alice is getting more than she would have in the first round.  Accepting the even split is the safest option for me, as it guarantees a significant amount of money."
