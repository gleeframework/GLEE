"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me getting the larger share. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep a decent chunk for myself! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'm taking the 6000$. It's not the best deal, but it's better than walking away with nothing!"
