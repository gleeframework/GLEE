"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get something too. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a terrible offer for Bob. While getting something is better than nothing, Bob can do much better by waiting even a few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a much fairer split.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the Lead:** Bob needs to take control of the negotiation.  Waiting for Alice to offer him a good deal is risky given the inflation. 
* **Fairness:** A 60/40 split is a strong starting point. It positions Bob as wanting a fair outcome but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Inflation Pressure:** While the inflation is worse for Alice, it also affects Bob.  He needs to secure a good deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 4000. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is inching closer, but this is still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is starting to impact her offers, which is good for Bob. He needs to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This seems like a fair compromise, Alice.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise. 
* **Inflation Reminder:**  Reminding Alice of the inflation keeps the pressure on her to settle sooner. 
* **Targetting a 50/50 Split:** Bob's ideal outcome is likely close to a 50/50 split. By gradually increasing his share, he aims to reach a point where Alice is more willing to accept."
