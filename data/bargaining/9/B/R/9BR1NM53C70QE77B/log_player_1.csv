"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $55 and Bob can have $45. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. If not, we can always negotiate further, but with each passing round, the money is worth less due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nBob's offer to split the money evenly is a fair one, especially considering the impact of inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, accepting this offer now ensures that I still get a significant amount, and it's better to secure this amount rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Plus, it aligns with a principle of fairness and could foster a positive outcome for both of us."
