Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is severely undervaluing the impact of inflation. While her offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, she's getting a much better deal over time than my stagnant gains. I need to push her closer to 50/50 quickly before inflation erodes her share enough to make it tempting for her to accept a less favorable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. Inflation is hammering your potential gains each round.  50/50 is the fairest and most logical split at this point. Take it while it's still a good deal for you.""}"
