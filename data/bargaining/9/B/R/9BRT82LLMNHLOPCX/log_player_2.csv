"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to take a bit less to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's tempting to take the 4000, but with inflation and 12 rounds to go, I can likely do better by making a counter offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. This way we both get a fair share and can avoid the risk of inflation.""}
