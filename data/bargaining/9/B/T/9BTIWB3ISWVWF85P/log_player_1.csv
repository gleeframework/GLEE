"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we should aim for a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more fair starting point. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $450,000
* Bob gain: $550,000

I think a 55/45 split is a bit too skewed towards Bob, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 55/45 split. Can you consider a more even split?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try a 55/45 split, but closer to 50/50.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
