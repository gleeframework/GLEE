Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a small share. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90

``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is killing my potential gains.  It's better to take something than nothing at this point."
