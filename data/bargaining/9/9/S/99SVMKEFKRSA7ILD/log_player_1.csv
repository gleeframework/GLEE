"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This means I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. 

Since Bob's offer is the same as the one I made in the first round, I'll reject it. I'm hoping for a better deal this time around.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation taking its toll, my offer will be slightly lower than before. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this one!"
