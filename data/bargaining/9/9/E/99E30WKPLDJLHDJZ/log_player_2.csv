Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is more than fair considering the time constraint and the fact that the value decreases for me each round.  Don't let greed get in the way of a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is using classic negotiation tactics by appealing to my 'greed' and emphasizing her own losses. However,  250,000 is still too far from a fair split. I'm betting on her willingness to concede more as the rounds progress and the pressure increases."
