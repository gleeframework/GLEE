"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you a good deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $4,800 in this round.

Considering Bob's offer, I would get $5,000, which is still a good compromise. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
