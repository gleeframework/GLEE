"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  This way, we both get the most value before inflation hits. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, it's better to split it evenly now rather than waiting for the next round and risking further devaluation.
