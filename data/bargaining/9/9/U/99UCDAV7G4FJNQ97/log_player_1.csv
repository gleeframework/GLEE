"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'll take the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. It's still not too bad, but I'm trying to get a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the original 80% I was offered, which is $64.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to aim for a higher percentage to account for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
