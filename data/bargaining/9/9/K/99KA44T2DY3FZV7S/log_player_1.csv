"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob. The message is a friendly reminder that we can split the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but it's still fair. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of 20 dollars is worth 18 dollars in real terms. I'm not sure I want to accept an offer that gives me less than what I proposed initially, especially since Bob's share is worth the same as before. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's previous offer was 80/20, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
