"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, 60-40 is still a good deal for you!""}\n\n###\nI've made my offer, now it's Alice's turn! I've taken into account the inflation and decided to ask for a bit more than half. Let's see what Alice thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'll give you a little more. But 55-45 is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI've decided to reject Alice's offer from round 3. Even though the inflation is taking its toll, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Alice seems willing to negotiate, so I'll try to push my luck a bit further!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, Alice! I'm starting to feel the pinch from inflation. 58-42 is a fair compromise, don't you think?""}\n\n###\nI've made my offer for round 4, taking into account the increasing inflation. I'm hoping Alice will see the sense in meeting me halfway (or at least, closer to halfway!). Fingers crossed!"
