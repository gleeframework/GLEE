"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it in a way that we both get a significant share. I think 60-40 is more than fair, considering the money is worth less to you with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
