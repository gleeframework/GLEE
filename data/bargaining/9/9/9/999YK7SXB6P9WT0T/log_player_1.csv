"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair offer, but I want a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $3,600.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit too greedy! I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and looking forward to his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, my gain is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll aim to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500 and keeping $4,500 for myself."
