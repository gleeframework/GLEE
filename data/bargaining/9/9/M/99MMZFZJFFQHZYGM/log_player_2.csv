"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a little more, but I think we can both do better.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's getting late, and the money is worth less with every round. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd love to get more, with the inflation and limited rounds, I think it's best to secure a fair split."
