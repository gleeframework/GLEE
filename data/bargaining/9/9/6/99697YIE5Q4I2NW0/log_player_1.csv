"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game over quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm actually gaining more in real terms than I was initially. However, I'm not sure if the inflation rate is the same for both of us, so I'll be cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
