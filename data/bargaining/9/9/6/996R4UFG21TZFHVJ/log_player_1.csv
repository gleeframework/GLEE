"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, aiming to secure a deal in the first round.  I'm hoping Bob will be happy with a smaller share and we can both avoid the risk of inflation."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial proposal, and while it's a 50/50 split, I'm not sure if the inflation on Bob's side will make him more willing to accept a lower offer in the future rounds. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal."

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to keep decreasing my offer, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds. I'm hoping Bob will start to see the value in settling for a lower offer, as the inflation is going to continue to hurt him more than me."
