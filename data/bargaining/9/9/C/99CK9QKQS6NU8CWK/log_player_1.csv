Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 50/50, considering we're both starting from the same position. Let's be fair and reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 50

Do you accept this offer?","{
