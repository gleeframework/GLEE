Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering a seemingly generous split, hoping to secure the money quickly. This is a risky move, but I need to make sure I get a good share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair and I don't want to risk losing even more money due to inflation. It's better to secure at least half the money now."
