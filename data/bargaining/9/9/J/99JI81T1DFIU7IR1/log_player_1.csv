"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a bit less, I'm the one taking the risk of rejection! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'm willing to take the risk of rejection, but I'd like a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better share. Your turn!""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to give me a slightly higher share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think I deserve a bigger share now! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to kick in!

I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although I'm willing to compromise, I don't think I'm getting a fair share. The difference between our gains is still too large, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still aiming for a fair and reasonable split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
