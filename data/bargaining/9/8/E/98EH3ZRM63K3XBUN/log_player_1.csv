"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me taking the larger share this time.  It's fair to have a change of roles after your initial proposal.

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better.

I'm adjusting my proposal to try to get a better deal."
