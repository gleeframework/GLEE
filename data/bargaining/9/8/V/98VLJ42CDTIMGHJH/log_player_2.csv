"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take most, but you still get something.  Accept this, and we can both walk away with some money. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Rejecting the offer means Bob gets to propose in the next round, and the money will be worth less for Alice then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. We both get a good chunk, and we can avoid the inflation eating away at our potential gains.  What do you say?""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer is fairer than the last one and we can both avoid more inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
