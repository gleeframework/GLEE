"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves us both with a significant gain. Let's not risk losing it all to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is good in the first round, it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation penalty is significant, so I want to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split before it starts to erode my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. We both stand to lose a lot if we keep rejecting offers and the inflation kicks in.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair deal, but I need to be compensated for the risk I'm taking with inflation. This offer is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a 50/50 split, inflation is a real concern. Accepting this offer ensures a decent gain for me while avoiding the risk of losing even more due to further inflation."
