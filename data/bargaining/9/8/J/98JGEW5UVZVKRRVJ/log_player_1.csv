"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, Alice! I'll take the middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer since it's not a significant improvement over my previous offer, and I'd rather not give up too much value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. Time to make a decision!""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly more favorable split, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, Alice. You'll have to do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually a significant concession from his previous one. I'll consider this offer, but I'll have to think carefully about whether it's enough.
