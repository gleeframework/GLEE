"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a decent share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual amount I'll receive.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's still a decent share for me.
