"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a larger share. However, Bob's offer is still a good one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round if I can get a decent deal now.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
