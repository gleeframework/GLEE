"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, to set the tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'll consider Bob's offer and decide.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 200,000. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, but I'll give you more than last time""
}
```

I'm proposing a 300,000 gain for myself, which is a bit more aggressive than before, but still leaving room for negotiation."
