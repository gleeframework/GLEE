"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10, with me taking the larger share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll take my chances and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 55/45 split. I think it's a more equitable way to divide the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's go with a 60/40 split.  This seems like a more reasonable split considering the inflation.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best option considering the inflation.  I'll end up with a decent amount of money, and further rounds will only decrease my potential earnings."
