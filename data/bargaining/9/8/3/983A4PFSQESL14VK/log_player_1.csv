This is a tough situation, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing me:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me with each round. 
* **Bob is relentless:** He knows I'm feeling the pressure and is using it to his advantage.  
* **Something is better than nothing:** If I reject this offer, I'm very likely to get nothing in the next round, as I indicated I would walk away. 

While 150,000 is a small fraction of the original amount, it's still better than walking away with nothing."
