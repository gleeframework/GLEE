"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts us both at a disadvantage, but I believe a 55/45 split is more reflective of the diminishing value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem favorable considering the inflation rates. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing loss due to inflation, this split is more reasonable as we both lose value each round.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Bob will accept this offer. The longer we drag this out, the less value the money holds for both of us."
