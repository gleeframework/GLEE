"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a little greedy in round 1, let's try again with a more balanced offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was a bit too greedy in round 1, I guess.

Considering the inflation effect, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since my gain is worth 20% less now, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get, so I'll reject it and see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Trying to find a balance, willing to give you a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share this time, hoping to find a mutually acceptable solution."
