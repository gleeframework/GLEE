"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations""
}
```

This offer is a straightforward 50/50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not going for 50/50 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 200,000$.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30 in his favor, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter that. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You offered 70/30, I'll offer 60/40. Your turn to decide""
}
```

I'm trying to shift the odds back in my favor, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're moving in the right direction, but I think I can do better than 60/40 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me a bit more. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up 250,000$.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make another aggressive offer, but this time, I'll aim for a 55/45 split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You've been pushing for a better deal, I'll meet you in the middle. Take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze Bob a bit more, but still leaving him with a decent amount."
