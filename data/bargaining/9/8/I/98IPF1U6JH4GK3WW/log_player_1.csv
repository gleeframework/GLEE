"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively fair offer, considering the game's rules. I'm also including a message to try to persuade Bob to accept my proposal. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. How about a slightly better split for me this time? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it. The money is still worth the same to me, and I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to Bob than my previous one, but still gives me a larger share. I'll also include a message to try to persuade Bob to accept my proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob now (5% less in each of the two previous rounds), he might be more inclined to accept a deal.

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, let's end this! It's a good deal for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting silly. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer again. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I don't feel the pressure of inflation like Bob does. Splitting it evenly might seem fair, but I think I can get a better deal if I hold out a bit longer. Let's see what happens next!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing pressure of inflation on Bob. Since the money is now worth around 19.1% less to him (compared to the first round), he might be more desperate to make a deal.

{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Seriously, Bob, this is a great deal for you at this point. Take it!""}"
