"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, see how it goes.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with an even split, now it's time to take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take the lead!

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an uneven split, especially with Bob trying to take the lead. I'll wait for another offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You wanted to take the lead, now it's time for me to take control!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slight adjustment to the split, giving me a slightly larger share, and I'm framing it as a response to Bob's previous attempt to take the lead. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take control, but I'm not letting go that easily! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is pushing back!

Considering the significant inflation that's affecting my share, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an even more uneven split, especially with the significant loss in value due to inflation. I'll wait for another offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slight adjustment to the split, giving me a slightly larger share, and I'm framing it as a compromise. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
