"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's not a significant improvement from my initial offer. I was willing to give Bob $2,000 initially, but now he's only offering $5,000. I think I can do better than that."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much""}
