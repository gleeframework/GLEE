I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 9500 for myself, and reduce Bob's to 500.  He rejected my previous offer, so I need to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want a large share.  The pressure of time is starting to work in my favor."

I'm still rejecting.  Bob is getting greedier, but I'm betting on the fact that he knows I'm not going to give up a huge portion of the money, and that the risk of getting nothing is higher for him with each passing round."
