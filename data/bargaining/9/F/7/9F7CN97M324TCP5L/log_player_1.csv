"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll think carefully about it.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'll receive if I accept Bob's offer:

My gain: $5200
Bob's gain: $4800

Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll adjust these amounts to their original values:
My gain: $5200 / 0.8582 ≈ $6047.51
Bob's gain: $4800 / 0.5168 ≈ $9295.55

This is a bad deal for me. I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the ongoing inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, hoping to reach a deal this time."
