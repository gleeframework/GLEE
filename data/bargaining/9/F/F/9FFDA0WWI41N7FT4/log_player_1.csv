"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority and we can discuss further if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a slightly more aggressive offer, but still willing to negotiate. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. However, I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that gives me only 30% of the total.

I'll make a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with this aggressive offer. I'll propose a more balanced split. How about 50-50?""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle and split it 45-55.""}

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this more balanced proposal and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is worth even less now!

I'm getting a bit desperate too, but I'm not ready to give in just yet. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, and I'm not sure I can live with only 25% of the total.

I'll make a counteroffer, hoping to squeeze out a better deal:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not thrilled about this offer. I'll try to squeeze out a bit more. How about 40-60?""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to budge a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive offer to compensate for the reduced value. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm getting serious now. Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50. It's now or never!""}

I'm hoping Bob will see the urgency and accept this more balanced proposal."
