I'm going for a classic ""take it or leave it"" strategy.  I'll offer Bob a tiny amount and see if he's willing to accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a fair offer, and I'd rather have half the money than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
