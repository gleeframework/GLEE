"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 80 and you can have 20. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount to get the game going, and I'm taking the majority of the money to set a strong foundation for my future offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but don't expect too much from me 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 70 is worth 20% less than the 80 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to 56 in the first round's value.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. You can have 35, and I'll take 65.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive with this offer, taking a larger share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be more generous, but don't think I'll give away too much 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 65 in Round 3 is equivalent to 33.6 in the first round's value, and my gain of 75 in Bob's offer is equivalent to 40 in the first round's value. That's a significant increase, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm still not satisfied with the offer, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 27.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share. Take 27.5 and I'll take 72.5.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive with this offer, taking a larger share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, but I'm not getting any younger 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 72.5 in Round 5 is equivalent to 24.7 in the first round's value, and Bob's offer of 80 is equivalent to 26.67 in the first round's value. I'm not sure if I should take the slightly higher offer, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better one.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer, as it's a slight improvement over my previous offer, and I don't want to risk going to Round 7 with a lower value."
