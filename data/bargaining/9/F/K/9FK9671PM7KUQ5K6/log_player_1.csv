I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping we can agree on it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still hoping for a more favorable split, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's try 80/20 this time."
