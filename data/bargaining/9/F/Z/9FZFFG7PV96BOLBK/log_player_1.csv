"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and consider inflation""
}
```

In this proposal, I, Alice, suggest taking $60, which seems like a generous offer considering the looming threat of inflation, which affects me but not Bob. The remaining $40 goes to Bob. The message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, acknowledging the unique conditions of our game while also highlighting the value of concluding the game early to avoid further devaluation of the money from my perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This is a more balanced split, taking into account inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Given the impact of inflation, accepting $45 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I'd accepted a lower nominal amount in the first round. Considering this, and aiming to maximize my gain, I choose to reject Bob's offer. The game's conditions necessitate strategic consideration of not just the nominal amount but its value over time. I'll propose a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split""
}
```

In this round, I've adjusted my proposal to take into account the inflation's impact on my potential gain. By suggesting $58 for myself, I'm aiming to counteract the devaluation effect from my perspective while still presenting Bob with a relatively fair offer, especially considering the game's progression and the fact that the money's value remains constant for him. The message emphasizes the reasonableness of this split under the current conditions, hoping to appeal to Bob's rationality and the mutual benefit of concluding the game sooner rather than later."
