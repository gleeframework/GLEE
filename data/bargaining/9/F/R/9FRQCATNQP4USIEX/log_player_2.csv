"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair play! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, I can potentially get a better deal in the next rounds. With each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I want to try to get more than half to make up for the loss in value.\n\nPlease let me know what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a bit more than half to make it fair.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that gives me 60% of the money, taking into account the 10% decrease in value due to inflation. I've also included a message to Alice explaining my reasoning, in the hopes that she'll understand my position and accept the offer.\n\nPlease let me know Alice's response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still think a 55/45 split is fair considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite Alice's willingness to give a bit more, the 55/45 split still doesn't account for the 19% decrease in value I've experienced due to inflation. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds to make up for this loss in value.\n\nPlease let me know what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, I need a bigger share to make up for the loss in value.""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my proposed share to 65%, considering the 19% decrease in value due to inflation. I've also included a message to Alice explaining my reasoning, in the hopes that she'll understand my position and accept the offer.\n\nPlease let me know Alice's response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share than 35 to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm accepting this offer because, despite the 34.39% decrease in value due to inflation, Alice's offer of a 55/45 split is more favorable to me than my previous offers. Considering the significant loss in value, I believe this is the best deal I can get, and I don't want to risk losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.\n\nPlease let me know that the game is over!"
