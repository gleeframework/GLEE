"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
 
I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, leaving Bob with 10% of the money. This leaves room for negotiation if he chooses to decline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 500,000 now, as the money is worth less with each passing round.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will accept a better offer, and the value of the money will continue to decrease."
