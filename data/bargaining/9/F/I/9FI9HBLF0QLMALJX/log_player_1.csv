"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking the majority of the money while still giving Bob a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, accepting this offer guarantees me $5,000, and with the inflation factor, holding out for more could be risky."
