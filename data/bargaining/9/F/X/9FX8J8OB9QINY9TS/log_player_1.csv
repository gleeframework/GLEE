Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is hurting us both. I'm standing firm on this offer - it's time for you to be realistic. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is significantly lower than my initial desired share, accepting it is the most practical choice at this point. The ongoing inflation is severely impacting both of our potential gains. Rejecting this offer will likely lead to both of us losing a larger amount in the subsequent rounds. It's better to secure a lesser share now than risk losing everything."
