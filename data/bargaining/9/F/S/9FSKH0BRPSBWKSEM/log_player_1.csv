I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping to secure almost all the money in the first round. Since inflation is a factor, it's in my best interest to close the deal as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes this a good deal. Getting 100,000 is better than risking losing even more in future rounds."
