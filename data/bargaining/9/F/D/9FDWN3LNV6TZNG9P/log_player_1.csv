Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to get this over quickly. It's a high risk, but the potential for inflation makes me want to secure my share as soon as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation."
