"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money.  I figure Bob might take it since there's a chance he doesn't know about the inflation. Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him than my previous one, and I know that with each round the inflation will only make my share less valuable. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to try and split the difference from the last round, hoping that Bob will see this as a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer more, the inflation is really starting to hurt Bob's potential gains. He's already lost a significant amount of value, and if we go another round, it's likely he'll take an even bigger hit. I'm going to accept this offer, as it's the best I'm likely to get."
