"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a small share to get the negotiations going.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $900,000 is now worth $810,000 (90% of $900,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to make a decision. I'm not thrilled about giving him 80% of the remaining money, but I'm willing to compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my $810,000 is now worth $729,000 (90% of $810,000).

I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal this time:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I still think 70% is a fair split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to get taken advantage of. I think 60% is a fair split. You can take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $729,000 is now worth $527,430 (90% of $729,000, and then 90% of that).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 60% of the remaining money, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.
