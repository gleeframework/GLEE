Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

# Alice gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
# Bob gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I'll accept this offer.
