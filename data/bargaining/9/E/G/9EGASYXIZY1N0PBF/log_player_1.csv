"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 70 and you can have 30. Let's see if we can do better in future rounds!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm hoping to set a good tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'm not too thrilled about the 40% gain, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal, considering the inflation is affecting my end. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now! Due to the 20% reduction in value, the money is now worth 64% of its original value.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take less. 55 for me, 45 for you. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to be reasonable, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal for myself!"
