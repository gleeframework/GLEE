"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a slightly larger share, but you get a good chunk too. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Besides, I don't think 40% is a fair share for me. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. Since the money loses value over time, it's better for both of us to come to an agreement sooner rather than later.""}"
