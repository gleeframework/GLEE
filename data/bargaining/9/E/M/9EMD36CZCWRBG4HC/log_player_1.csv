"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and consider the inflation, I should get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. Given the inflation rates, I believe this is a reasonable offer as the money is worth less to both of us with each passing round, but more significantly less for Bob. This division acknowledges the impact of inflation but still offers Bob a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be reasonable. This offer accounts for the faster inflation we face. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because, despite the adjustment in amounts that slightly closes the gap between our gains, the difference in inflation rates between us means that the value of what I receive diminishes less significantly than Bob's share. Therefore, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more favorable division for me, considering the impact of inflation on both our shares."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, I've adjusted my offer slightly to reflect our different depreciation rates. This is a fairer split given the circumstances.""}\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the cumulative effect of inflation on both our potential gains and adjusted my proposal from the first round. Given that the money is worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Bob with each round, I believe a slight increase in my share while still offering Bob a considerable amount is a reasonable adjustment. This acknowledges the faster depreciation of the money's value for Bob while ensuring I don't undervalue my own share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, the money is losing value fast! 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us, especially with Bob facing a nearly 50% depreciation, I believe this offer is reasonable. The difference between our shares is minimal, and considering the rapid loss of value, further negotiation may not yield a significantly better outcome for me. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a known quantity rather than risking further depreciation in subsequent rounds."
