"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $20 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $20 * 0.95 = $19.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with taking only 20% of the total, but I'm also not sure if I want to reject and risk getting an even worse offer in the next round. I'll decide to accept this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
