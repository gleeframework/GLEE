"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think the split is still too skewed towards Bob, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a slightly more even split, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. We're both losing money with each round, so let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Splitting it down the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'd rather take the $5,000 now than risk losing more value in future rounds."
