"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While a 50/50 split seems fair in principle, Alice's offer slightly favors her. Since the money devalues more for her with each round, I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's find a split that's a bit more advantageous for both of us, Alice. How about this?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. This offer is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the devaluation, and her offer is now closer to an even split. However, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is fair and we can both walk away with something substantial.""
}
