Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  While I'm aware of the inflation, I believe this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a small share to consider.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation.  It's better than risking getting even less in subsequent rounds."
