{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the new values are:

* My gain of 500,000$ is worth 90% of the original 700,000$, which is 630,000$.
* Bob's gain of 500,000$ is worth 95% of the original 300,000$, which is 285,000$.

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as I'd rather have more than 630,000$. I'll reject the offer.
