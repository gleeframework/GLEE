"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly!"

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to split the money evenly now. I'll think for a moment...

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
