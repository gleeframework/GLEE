"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm taking almost everything, knowing Bob will reject this proposal. I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking almost everything, and while I'm getting something, it's worth 20% less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob 100,000, which is a better deal than he got in the previous round. Hopefully, he'll accept it, as the inflation will only continue to devalue my earnings if we keep going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has significantly devalued my share, it's still better to accept this offer than to risk getting nothing in the next round."
