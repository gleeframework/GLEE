Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your offer was too low. This is a compromise - still a great deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
