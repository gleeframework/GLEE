"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still a reasonable compromise."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and start fresh! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure why Bob wants to ""start fresh"" and meet in the middle, but I think it's a bit too generous for him. I'd rather wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep a slight edge""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, keeping a 10-point advantage for myself, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still hoping for a fair split 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept a 55/45 split. It's not the best deal for me, but it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money decreasing in value due to inflation."
