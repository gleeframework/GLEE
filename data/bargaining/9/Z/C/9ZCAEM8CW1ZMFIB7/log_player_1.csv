Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, taking the lion's share of the money. I figure Bob might be hesitant, but I'm hoping he'll accept rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though I get a much smaller share, it's still better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
