Let's start fair and even.  I propose we split the money equally."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'll increase my share a little bit, but still offer a relatively fair split considering the inflation."

Bob is getting greedy. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal."
