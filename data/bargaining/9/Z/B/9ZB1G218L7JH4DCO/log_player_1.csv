"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take 90% and leave 10% for Bob. This is a good starting point, and since I don't know how inflation affects him, it's a safe bet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my previous offer, even after the 10% inflation.  I'll reject this and make my own counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering 60% for myself, and 40% for Bob. This is a fair compromise, considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough, even after the significant inflation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. With the inflation, this is the best I can do while still ensuring a decent return for myself.  Hopefully, Bob will recognize the value of this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Although the inflation has been quite significant, Bob's offer is still better than what I've been able to secure in the previous rounds. It's time to accept and avoid further potential losses."
