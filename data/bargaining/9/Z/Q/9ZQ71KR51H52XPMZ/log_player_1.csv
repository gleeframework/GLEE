**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is severely impacting Alice's potential gains. While accepting $3,000 is far from ideal, rejecting the offer means risking an even lower amount in the next round. The longer the game continues, the more Bob benefits from Alice's desperation due to the inflation."
