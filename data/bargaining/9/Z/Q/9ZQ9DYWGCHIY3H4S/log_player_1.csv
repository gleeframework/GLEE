"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll give you 60/40, a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this compromise. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now to make up for it. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
