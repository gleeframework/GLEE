"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual amounts as follows:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40

I accept Bob's offer.
