Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor.  This is fair, as my money loses value slower than yours.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
