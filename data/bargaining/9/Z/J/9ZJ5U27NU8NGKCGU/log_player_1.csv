"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that is heavily in my favor, but still leaves Bob with something. I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept in the first round, as the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation is making this offer much more appealing. It's a fair split, and accepting ensures I get at least half of the value, which is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
