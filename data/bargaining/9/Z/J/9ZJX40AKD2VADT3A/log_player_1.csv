Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very high offer to myself, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept it in the first round.  Let's see how greedy he is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to keep more, it's better to get 500,000 now than risk getting nothing at all later. There's no guarantee that Bob will be so generous in the future!"
