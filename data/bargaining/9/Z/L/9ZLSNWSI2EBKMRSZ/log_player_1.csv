Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,

I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in a 60-40 split and we can wrap this up quickly!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, as it reflects our equal contributions. Let's move on from here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
