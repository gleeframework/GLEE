"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, so I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split. Let's close the deal this round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the game's current state
We are in Round 3 of the game. In each round, the value of the money decreases by 5% for me (Alice) and by 10% for Bob due to inflation. We need to divide $100 between us, and the game continues until one of us accepts the other's proposal.

### Step 2: Review previous rounds and proposals
- In Round 1, I proposed a 55-45 split in my favor with the message ""Let's be fair and close the deal!"" which Bob rejected.
- In Round 2, Bob proposed a 45-55 split in his favor, adjusting my initial proposal, which I rejected.

### Step 3: Consider the impact of inflation on our gains
Since the money's value decreases by 5% for me and 10% for Bob with each round, it's beneficial for both of us to end the game as soon as possible to maximize our gains. However, we also want to get the best deal possible.

### Step 4: Formulate a new proposal
Given the previous rejections and considering the inflation, I should propose a split that might be more acceptable to Bob but still favorable to me, considering the decreasing value of money.

### Step 5: Decide on the proposal details
I will propose a 50-50 split. This is more favorable to Bob than my initial proposal but less favorable than his proposal in Round 2. Given the message, I will emphasize the need to close the deal quickly due to inflation.

### Step 6: Write the proposal in the required JSON format
The proposal will be: {""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting us both. Let's split it down the middle and close the deal!""}

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting us both. Let's split it down the middle and close the deal!""}"
