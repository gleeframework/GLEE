This offer is terrible! I'd rather take my chances with future rounds and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm offering a much fairer split this time around, with a majority of the money going to me. I'm confident that this will be a good deal for Alice and that she will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the first round, it's still not a fair split, especially with the inflation factor. I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Alice a slightly better deal this time, but I'm still aiming for a majority share given the inflation impacting my gains. This should be a more appealing offer for Alice, and I'm hoping she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much better deal for me than the previous rounds, considering the inflation. While I would prefer a more even split, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
