Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

While Bob's offer seems to acknowledge the inflation, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. By rejecting, I'm betting he'll become more reasonable in the next round as the inflation will hurt him more."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

""message"": ""The inflation is hurting us both, Bob. Let's settle this fairly before it gets any worse. This offer reflects the changing value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is indeed a problem, but I think I can still get a bit more. This is my best offer yet. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

This is a tough call, but I still think rejecting is the best play. Here's why:

* **Bob is being greedy:**  Even with inflation, his offer is barely budging. He's clearly trying to exploit the situation.
* **Time is running out for him:** While the inflation hurts me more in absolute terms, Bob is losing a bigger percentage of his potential gains with each round.
* **Final round desperation:** If I reject this round, he'll be forced to make a much better offer in the final round to avoid walking away with almost nothing. 

It's a gamble, but I'm hoping to call Bob's bluff."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is it, Bob.  The inflation means we're both losing out. Take this offer and we both get something reasonable.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last chance:** This is the final round. If Bob rejects, we both get nothing. 
* **Slight edge for me:** I'm taking a slightly larger share to reflect the fact that I've absorbed more inflation.
* **Urgency and fairness:** The message emphasizes that time is up and this offer is the best way to salvage a bad situation for both of us.

It's risky, but at this point, Bob has to decide if greed is worth getting nothing at all."
