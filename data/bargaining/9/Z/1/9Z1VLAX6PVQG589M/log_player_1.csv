"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll aim to get a larger share. But I don't want to be too greedy, or Bob might reject and I'll get an even worse deal next round.

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, the money is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll need to be careful not to get a bad deal.

However, Bob's offer is a relatively small increase in his share, and I'm not sure if he's trying to get a good deal or just testing my patience. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is really taking its toll now. The money is worth 19.39% less than in the first round. I'll need to be bold and make a strong offer to get a good deal.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm taking a bigger share this time, but I think it's necessary to compensate for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money. I'll need to be careful not to get a bad deal, but I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get.

However, since Bob's offer is closer to my previous offer, I'll take a chance and accept it. I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.
