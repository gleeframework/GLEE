"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better deal. The 55/45 split in Alice's favor doesn't seem fair to me, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose a different split in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 52.5/47.5 split is more reasonable. Let's meet in the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I've taken into account the inflation factor and tried to find a compromise. I'm hoping Alice will find this proposal more acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for you with this inflation.  I'll come up slightly, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 465000 
# Alice gain: 535000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation factor, I think Alice's offer is reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round. The 46.5/53.5 split is closer to what I had in mind, and I'm willing to accept it to finalize the deal. Please let Alice know that I accept her offer."
