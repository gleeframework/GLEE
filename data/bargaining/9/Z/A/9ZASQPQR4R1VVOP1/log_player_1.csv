"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $55 and leave $45 for Bob. The message ""Let's be fair"" aims to persuade Bob that this division is reasonable and that prolonging the game would only result in both parties losing value due to inflation. By accepting this offer, both can avoid the devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice decides to reject Bob's offer of $45 for her and $55 for him. Given the impact of inflation, Alice's share would effectively be worth less than the face value, making the offer less appealing. By rejecting, Alice aims to negotiate a better deal in the next round, hoping that the threat of further inflation will prompt Bob to offer a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $52 and leave $48 for Bob. The message ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation"" acknowledges the devaluation of money over the rounds and suggests a compromise that splits the difference more evenly, taking into account the greater loss in value Bob faces. This approach aims to appear reasonable and increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
