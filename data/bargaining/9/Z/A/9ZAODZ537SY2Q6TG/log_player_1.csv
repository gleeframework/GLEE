"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 30, and I'll take 70. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, but I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate if he wants a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get $50, no need to fight over it! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'd be better off accepting this offer to get a larger share of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
