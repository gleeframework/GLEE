I'm taking a greedy approach and offering Bob only 100,000. I figure this is enough to entice him, but leaves me with the vast majority of the money. It's a bit risky, but I'm hoping he won't want to wait and face the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation is a serious factor. My offer in the first round was incredibly risky, and it looks like Bob's learned from my mistake. I'm willing to accept this offer.  It's better than taking the risk of another round and potentially losing even more money."
