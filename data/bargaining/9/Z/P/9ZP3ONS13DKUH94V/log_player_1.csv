"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the initial amount. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I need to consider that the money is worth 5% less for me, so the effective gain for me is $19.00 (20% of $100 * 0.95).
