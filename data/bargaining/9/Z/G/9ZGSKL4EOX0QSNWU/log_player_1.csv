"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still holding back 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

After some thought, I've decided to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60/40 split, I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give in too much""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting any younger 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

Bob's offer is still a 40/60 split, which is not ideal, but I'm starting to consider it. After some thought, I've decided to...

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
