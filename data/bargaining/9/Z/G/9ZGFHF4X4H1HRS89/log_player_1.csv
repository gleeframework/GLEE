"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you're still getting the short end of the stick! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'm getting a slightly better deal than in the first round, but still less than Bob.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is trying to get a bigger share again!
