Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. We've both rejected each other's offers, and further inflation will only hurt us both.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical way to move forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
