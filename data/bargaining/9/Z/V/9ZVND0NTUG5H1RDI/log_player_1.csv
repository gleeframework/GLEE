Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the same offer you made in Round 1.  It seems fair given the inflation, and dragging this out any further just hurts us both.

Bob is right.  While this offer is slightly worse for me than a 50/50 split in round 1, it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting even less in future rounds."
