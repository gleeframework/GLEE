"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small portion to keep things interesting. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject the offer. While it's tempting to get something, the inflation rate for Alice is much higher, making this offer a good starting point for negotiation in my favor. I want to see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round, given the inflated value of her share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair considering the inflation rates. Let's see if you're willing to work with me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. The inflation rate is hitting Alice harder, but she's still offering a larger share for herself. I believe I can get a better deal if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm sticking with my previous proposal.  Let's find a solution before inflation eats away too much of our potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up more than that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 6200 
# Alice gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired split. The inflation is hurting both of us, and it's better to accept a good offer now rather than risk getting nothing."
