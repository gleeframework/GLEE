"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small portion to keep things interesting.""

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I'm not sure if 60/40 is the best split for me. I'd like to try to get a better deal.
