Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
