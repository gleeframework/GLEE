"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not happy with only 10% and I'm sure I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the money loses value with each round. Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept a 60/40 split. Let's meet in the middle at 70/30.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm losing value rapidly, and 30% is a decent deal considering the circumstances. It's time to end this."
