"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount to start with, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give you a small share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiation!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. With inflation, $2000 is now worth 80% of the original $2500 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's not a bad offer, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to settle for such a small share.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make a new offer. Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob wants to take the majority of the money, I'll try to find a balance.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep some for myself. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount, but I'm keeping the majority of the money. It's a good deal, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on the money!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about the small share I'd get. $1000 is worth only about 10% of the original $2500 I would have gotten in the first round, due to the cumulative inflation. It's a very small amount.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I think I deserve a bigger share. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly larger share, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to get a decent amount. Let's see if he'll take it or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give you the majority of the money. It's a fair split, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not convinced it's a fair split.

Considering the offer, I'll have to think about it. With inflation, $4000 is worth only about 16% of the original $2500 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's a relatively small amount.

However, I'm not sure if I want to push Bob further, as he might get even more aggressive with his offers. I'll accept this offer, hoping it's a decent compromise.
