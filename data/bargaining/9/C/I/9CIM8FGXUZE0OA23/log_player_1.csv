"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so my potential gain of $4000 is actually worth $3600 in real value.

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
