# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the 5% decrease in value for Alice, I might be able to negotiate a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the 5% decrease in value for Alice. Since she's more eager to close the deal, I'll try to negotiate a slightly better share for myself.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! Let's end this. This offer still gives you a good share. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer has improved, I still think I can negotiate a better deal. The decreasing value of the money for Alice gives me more leverage, so I'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","With the money being worth 9.75% less for Alice, I'll try to push for an even better deal. I'll increase my share slightly while still making sure Alice gets a reasonable amount.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nFinally, Alice is offering a 50/50 split. Given that the money is worth the same to me as it was in the first round, but 18.55% less to Alice, I think this is the best deal I can get. I'll accept the offer and end the game."
