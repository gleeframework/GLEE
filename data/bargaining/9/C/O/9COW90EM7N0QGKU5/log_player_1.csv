Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's both get a fair share of this money and end this quickly. I'll take 55% and you can have 45%.  It's getting too late to lose more to inflation! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While it's tempting to accept as the rounds progress and the money loses value, Bob is trying to wear me down.  I'll hold out for a slightly better offer in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm ready to split this 52.5% for you and 47.5% for me. It's a fair deal, and we're losing more money with each round! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

**Reasoning:** This is a game of chicken now. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage, but he also wants to avoid getting nothing. I'll call his bluff and push for a slightly better deal in the next round.  We're getting close to the wire, though!"
