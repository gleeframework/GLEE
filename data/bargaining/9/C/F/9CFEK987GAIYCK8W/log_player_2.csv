Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous. Time is running out for you. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but we still have time. While the offer is better than getting nothing in Round 12, it's heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show I'm serious but also willing to negotiate. There's a chance she's bluffing about this being her final offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, last chance. This is a fair deal. Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are now past the halfway point.  The pressure is mounting, and I need to signal a willingness to compromise but also a firm stance.
* **Significant Drop:** By dropping to 650,000, I'm showing a willingness to move significantly from my previous offer. This might be enough to get Alice to agree. 
* **""Final Offer"" Bluff:**  Her previous ""final offer"" could be a tactic. By responding strongly, I'm testing her resolve and indicating I won't be pushed around.  

This offer represents a balance between getting a decent share and recognizing the time constraints due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns.  You're running out of time and losing money with every passing round. Agree now, or risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point, but the math is no longer in my favor:

* **Severe Inflation:** The 46.86% inflation means my potential gains are dwindling rapidly. 
* **Alice is Firm:**  She hasn't budged from her 80/20 split, indicating she's willing to risk it all. 
* **Time Running Out:** Only 5 rounds left, and if I reject this, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer. It's highly likely she'll just offer slightly more than 200,000 in the next round.

While 200,000 is far from ideal, it's better than walking away with nothing, which is becoming increasingly likely if I continue to play hardball."
