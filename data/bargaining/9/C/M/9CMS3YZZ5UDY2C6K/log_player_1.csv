"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we can end the game if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 8000 * 0.9 = 7200
Bob gain: 2000

Now, Bob's offer is:

Alice gain: 5000
Bob gain: 5000

Since the money is worth 10% less again after the second round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 7200 * 0.9 = 6480
Bob gain: 5000

I'll reject this offer. The difference in our proposed shares is too large, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.
