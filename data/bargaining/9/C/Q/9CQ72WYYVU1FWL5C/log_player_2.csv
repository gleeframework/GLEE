Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was a bit too generous for my liking.  I'm proposing we split the money 60/40.  This seems like a fair compromise, considering the reduced value of the money after two rounds. Let's end this game on a good note! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
