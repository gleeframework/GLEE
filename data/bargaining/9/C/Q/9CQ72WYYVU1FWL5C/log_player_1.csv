"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  This is a big sum, so let's split it fairly. I propose we go 55/45, with me taking the slightly larger share.  It's a good starting point for a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
