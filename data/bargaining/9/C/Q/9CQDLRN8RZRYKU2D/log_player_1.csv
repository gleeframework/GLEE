"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is a risky move, but it's a classic ultimatum game strategy. It maximizes my potential gains in the first round. I'm betting that Bob will see the value in getting something rather than nothing if we continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's a far cry from my initial offer, accepting this offer is the best move.  I'll get 1000, which is better than the 0 I would get if I rejected and the game ended."
