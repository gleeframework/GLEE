"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. I'm trying to be generous while also taking into account that I'm the one making the first offer. I'll attach a friendly message to set a positive tone for the negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's not waste any more time with this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 20% less, Bob's offer of $450,000 is actually equivalent to $360,000 in the first round, and his gain of $550,000 is equivalent to $440,000. Considering this, I think I can do better, so I'll reject the offer.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 20% less than in the first round, and another 20% less in this round, I need to take that into account when making my offer. I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share to try to entice him to accept, while also keeping in mind that I want to maximize my own gain.
