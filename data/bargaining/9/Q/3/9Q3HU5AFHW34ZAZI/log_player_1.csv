Let's see if Bob is happy with 10% of the money!  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of it in the first round, as the inflation will start eating into my share with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to keep more for myself, the inflation is a big factor here. With each round, my share is worth less.  A 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation, and guarantees me at least something substantial."
