"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll consider the actual amounts as follows:
# Alice gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
# Bob gain: 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

This time, I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll calculate the actual amounts as follows:
# Alice gain: 3000 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = 4135.33
# Bob gain: 7000 / 0.727 = 9625.61

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 3800, ""bob_gain"": 6200}

This time, I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the increased inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll calculate the actual amounts as follows:
# Alice gain: 2500 / 0.5915 (1 - 0.4085) = 4226.85
# Bob gain: 7500 / 0.5915 = 12681.93

I'll reject this offer. It's still not favorable enough for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer:
