"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a majority of the money, but it's still a reasonable starting point.  I want to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is clearly unfair.  I'll take my chances and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm reducing my share, but not by much. Since I'm the one making the offer now, I'm confident that Bob will see the value in accepting a deal rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1900 
# Bob gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has hit me hard, I have to accept this offer. Bob is being generous, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
