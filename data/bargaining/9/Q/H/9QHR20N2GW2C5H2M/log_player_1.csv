"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

With the new offer, I'll get 40% of the original $100, but since the money is worth 5% less, it's equivalent to 40% of $100 * 0.95 = $38.

I'll decide to reject this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to the cumulative inflation (5% in round 1 and 5% in round 2), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the original $100, but considering the inflation, it's equivalent to a higher percentage of the current value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gain for me considering the cumulative inflation:

Initial value of 42% of $100 is $42. With a 5% inflation in round 1, it's $42 * 0.95 = $39.90. With another 5% inflation in round 2, it's $39.90 * 0.95 = $37.935. With another 5% inflation in round 3, it's $37.935 * 0.95 = $35.987625. With another 9.26% inflation in round 4, it's $35.987625 * 0.90626 = $32.59.

So, the effective gain for me in this offer is $32.59.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the cumulative inflation, the money I gain is worth 19.26% less than in the first round. Let's calculate the effective gain for me:

Initial value of 50% of $100 is $50. With a 5% inflation in round 1, it's $50 * 0.95 = $47.50. With another 5% inflation in round 2, it's $47.50 * 0.95 = $45.125. With another 5% inflation in round 3, it's $45.125 * 0.95 = $42.860625. With another 9.26% inflation in round 4, it's $42.860625 * 0.90626 = $38.8935. With another 5% inflation in round 5, it's $38.8935 * 0.95 = $36.850825.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 46,
  ""bob_gain"": 54
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly higher percentage of the current value, considering the inflation."
