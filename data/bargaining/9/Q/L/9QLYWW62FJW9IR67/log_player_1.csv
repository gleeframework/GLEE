"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to keep 90% of the money and give Bob 10%. It's a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further if he's not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer to keep more, the inflation makes it difficult to get a better deal.  A 50/50 split is fair given the circumstances."
