"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, let's start with a reasonable offer""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and leaving $2,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair and reasonable starting point to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth 80% of $6,000, which is $4,800. Bob's gain of $4,000 is worth... well, I don't know how much it's worth to him, but I'll have to consider the offer based on my own perspective.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the compromise, and I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $7,000, which is worth 70% of $10,000 due to the inflation, and leaving $3,000 for Bob. I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still want to be fair 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains. My $5,000 gain is now worth 51.2% of $10,000, which is $5,120.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. On one hand, it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $5,120 and call it a day."
