Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value faster for Bob than for Alice. This means that each round, Bob's potential gains are shrinking faster than Alice's.
* **Alice's offer:** While not ideal, it offers Bob a significant sum, considering the inflation. Accepting allows Bob to secure some of the money before it depreciates further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting again risks ending up with a worse offer from Alice, as her bargaining position strengthens with each round.

While Bob might prefer a larger share, the risk of getting nothing is significant. Accepting this offer is the most pragmatic decision given the circumstances."
