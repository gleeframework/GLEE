"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for Bob, this offer is effectively:

# Alice gain: 2000
# Bob gain: 6400

I'll accept this offer.
