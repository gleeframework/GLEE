"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's the best way to ensure we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $500,000 x 0.95 = $475,000
Bob gain: $500,000 x 0.95 = $475,000

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair split, and we can both get a decent share of the money.
