"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a generous offer considering that the money loses value with each passing round, and Bob loses more value than I do. I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this offer and accept it, ending the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a split. Considering the inflation, this is fair. 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. With the money losing value at a faster rate for Bob, I think he'll be more willing to compromise in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value to potentially get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making a slightly more aggressive offer this round, taking into account the increased loss of value for Bob. I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is still a relatively fair offer, considering the effects of inflation, and accept it. The message is brief and to the point, emphasizing the impact of inflation on the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, at this point, the effects of inflation are significant, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us. A 50/50 split is a fair offer, considering the circumstances, and I don't think I can get a better deal in future rounds. It's time to stop the game and take what I can get."
