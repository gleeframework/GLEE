"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is a friendly and cooperative approach to initiate the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer accounts for the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The fact that the money is worth 20% less for me and only 10% less for Bob means that I'm losing more value over time, so I want to try to get a larger share to compensate for that loss."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair adjustment""}\n\nI've adjusted my offer to account for the decreasing value of the money. Since I'm losing 20% of the value each round, I've increased my share to 58% to try to compensate for that loss. The message is a straightforward explanation of my reasoning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, let's be realistic. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think this offer is reasonable. Since Bob has framed this as their final offer and the value of the money is dropping rapidly, I don't think I can get a better deal in the next round. It's better to accept this offer and get something rather than risk losing even more value."
