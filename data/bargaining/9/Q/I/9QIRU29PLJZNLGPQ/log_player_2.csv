"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 70/30. It's a good deal for you in the first round, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal. 30 is a relatively low offer, and I think I can do better. Additionally, since Alice doesn't lose any value in subsequent rounds, she has less incentive to negotiate, so I want to put pressure on her to make a better offer. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less to me now, I'll aim a bit higher to compensate for the loss.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 42, ""alice_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. 42/58 is a fairer split, considering the decreasing value for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is impacting you, but my offer is still on the table. 65/35 is a fair deal, especially considering time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the money is worth 9.75% less to me now, Alice's offer of 35 is still relatively low, and I think I can negotiate a better deal. Since Alice's gain isn't affected by inflation, she has less incentive to compromise. I'll try to hold out for a better offer, considering we still have 9 rounds left. The pressure of time running out might work in my favor if I can make Alice think I'm willing to walk away. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","With the money being worth 9.75% less to me, I'll aim to get a better deal to compensate for the loss. Since Alice's gain isn't affected by inflation, I'll try to appeal to her sense of fairness.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I think 45/55 is a reasonable split. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before time runs out.""}"
