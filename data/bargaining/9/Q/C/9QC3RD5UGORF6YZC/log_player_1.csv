"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $4500 is equivalent to $3600 in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In the third round, my gain will be worth 40% less than in the second round. Considering this, I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 3600, ""bob_gain"": 6400}

This way, I'll get 36% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 64%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less in the fourth round, my gain of $5800 is equivalent to $2360 in the first round. This is a significant drop in value, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept this offer.
