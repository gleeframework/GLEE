Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I propose you get $4,500 and I get $5,500. This seems like a reasonable starting point, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. Let's be practical and split the money evenly at $5,000 each. This way we both benefit before inflation further devalues your share.  It's a win-win. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
