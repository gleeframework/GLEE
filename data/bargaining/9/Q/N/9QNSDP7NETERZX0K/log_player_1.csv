"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI have offered a division where I take 55 dollars and Bob takes 45 dollars, considering that with each passing round, the value of money decreases more significantly for Bob than for me. The message emphasizes fairness, taking into account the impact of inflation on our shares."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts you at a slight advantage, but my turn to propose a more agreeable split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation affecting both of our gains, his proposed split doesn't take into sufficient account the greater decrease in value he faces. I believe there's room for a more favorable division in the next round, considering the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the growing inflation impact, this is a more realistic split""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased my share to 58 dollars and decreased Bob's share to 42 dollars, emphasizing in the message that the increasing impact of inflation warrants this adjustment. The idea is to press my advantage while still presenting it as a fair consideration of the devaluing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time with the back and forth. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer of a 50/50 split because, given the current state of inflation where my gain is worth 14.26% less and Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than initially, I believe I can still negotiate for a larger share. The difference in how inflation affects us gives me leverage to seek a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Given the significant difference in inflation impact, this is the most reasonable offer""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased my share to 60 dollars and decreased Bob's share to 40 dollars. The message justifies this split by pointing out the considerable difference in how inflation affects our gains, implying that this division is the most reasonable considering the circumstances. I'm aiming to maximize my advantage while still presenting the offer as fair and logical."
