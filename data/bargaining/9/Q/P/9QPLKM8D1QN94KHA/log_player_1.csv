"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to split the money evenly. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not ready to give up my potential for a larger share just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less after the first round and another 5% less after the second round, it's now worth 90% of its original value. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account:

{""alice_gain"": 6300, ""bob_gain"": 3700}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now. Considering the reduced value, I'll have to reassess Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 85.74% of its original value, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get at this point."
