# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to take advantage of my losses due to inflation. While the offer is better than his last, it's still heavily in his favor. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even with the increasing inflation."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still heavily favoring himself in this deal, even with his ""compromise.""  He's trying to use the threat of inflation to pressure me into accepting a bad deal. I need to hold out for a more balanced offer."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm tired of this back and forth.  Let's end this fairly, with a split that reflects the value we're losing each round. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is getting frustrating. Bob is just mirroring my offers back to me with slightly better terms for himself, hoping I'll crack under the pressure of inflation. I need to remain firm and make it clear I'm not accepting anything less than a reasonably fair deal."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is more than fair. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, yet I'm still offering you a large sum.  Let's be done with this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm significantly lowering my demand to make it clear I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be taken advantage of. By offering slightly more than Bob's previous offer for himself, I'm hoping to entice him to accept while still securing a decent share for myself, despite the mounting inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing out here. Let's agree on a split that's closer to even to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're running out of time, and the inflation is eating away at any potential gains. While this offer still favors Bob, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. Accepting ensures I at least walk away with something substantial, rather than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
