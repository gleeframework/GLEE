"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's split the difference.  900k for me, 100k for you.  This seems fair, and I'm not sure how much longer we can keep playing without losing too much to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
