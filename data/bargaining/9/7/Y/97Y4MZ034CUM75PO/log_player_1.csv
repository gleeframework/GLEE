"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm taking a big chunk, but it's round one and I want to see if Bob is willing to play ball.  It's risky, but I'm hoping to get a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  Even though Bob is taking most of the money, inflation has devalued my share significantly, so I'm better off accepting this offer than risking another round.  It's better to have some money now than risk getting nothing at all."
