"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80% for myself.""
}
```

This way, Bob gets 20 dollars, and I get 80 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll need to take that into account. With the offer of a 50-50 split, Bob is effectively getting 40 dollars (since 50 dollars is worth 80% of the original 50 dollars due to the 20% decrease in value).

My gain of 50 dollars is still worth 50 dollars, as it's not affected by inflation.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to try to get more than 50 dollars. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, and I rejected it, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 20% less for Bob each round. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You said we should split it evenly, but since the money is worth less for you, I'll offer you 40. I'll take 60.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a slightly better share than 40%. How about 45 for me and 55 for you? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob each round, after 3 rounds, the money he gains is worth 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512 of the original value. So, in this round, Bob's gain of 45 dollars is worth 45 * 0.512 = 23.04 dollars.

My gain of 55 dollars is still worth 55 dollars, as it's not affected by inflation.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a slightly lower share than my last offer, but I need at least 40% to make this worthwhile.  Let's try 40 for me and 60 for you. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob each round, after 5 rounds, the money he gains is worth 0.8^5 = 0.32768 of the original value. So, in this round, Bob's gain of 40 dollars is worth 40 * 0.32768 = 13.1072 dollars.

Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob each round, after 7 rounds, the money he gains is worth 0.8^7 = 0.2097152 of the original value. So, in this round, Bob's gain of 35 dollars is worth 35 * 0.2097152 = 7.34928 dollars.
