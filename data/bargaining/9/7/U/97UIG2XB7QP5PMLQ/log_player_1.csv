"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you can take 30. We can discuss further if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with the message that this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiating further if Bob wants to try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. It's a good starting point and we can adjust from here. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me in the second round, I'd rather not accept a 50/50 split since I'd end up with less than I would have in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in the third round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round, but I'm still looking for a good deal. 60 for me, 40 for you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. 45 for me, 55 for you. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me in the fourth round, I'm in a tough spot. However, Bob's offer is still a good one, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 55% share.
