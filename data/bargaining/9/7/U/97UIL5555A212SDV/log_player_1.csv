"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I'm getting $400,000, which is 80% of the initial amount, I'm actually getting more in real terms than in the first round. On the other hand, Bob is getting 60% of the initial amount, which is less than in the first round.

I'll take it!
