"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less generous offer, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased for me, but I still need to make a decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. My current proposal is not good enough for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the lead, it's my turn now!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, but I still need to make a decision.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. The 45% I'll get is better than the 40% I would get if I wait for another round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
