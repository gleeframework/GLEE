Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I think 60 is still a fair amount considering the risk of future rounds. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution.

# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
