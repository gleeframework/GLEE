"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering the game just started and the money is still worth its full value. I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is a relatively high percentage. Let's see if he accepts!"

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
