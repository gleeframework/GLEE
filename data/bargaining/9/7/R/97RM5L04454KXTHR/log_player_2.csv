# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is ""fair"" in the sense of being a straight split, I don't think it's the best move for me in the long run. I have time and the advantage of the inflation working in my favor."

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Alice is still offering less than the original split, and the inflation is working in my favor. I'll continue to try and negotiate a better deal."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is inching closer to what I want, but the inflation is working strongly in my favor. I'm still not seeing a good enough deal for me, especially with so much time remaining."
