I'm going for a bold strategy, Alice.  I'm going to propose taking almost everything and leaving Bob with just $1. This is a risky move, as Bob could reject it, but the inflation risk is high, and I want to maximize my share before the money loses value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, Bob's offer is still a decent amount of money.  I don't know how much inflation is affecting Bob, and if I reject this, I run the risk of getting an even worse deal in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
