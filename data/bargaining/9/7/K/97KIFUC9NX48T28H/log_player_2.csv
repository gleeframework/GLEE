Let's see if I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 
Let's see if Alice takes my offer!  I'm going for a slightly better deal for myself this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like to get more, the inflation is starting to hit hard. Taking 4500 now is better than risking nothing in the next rounds."
