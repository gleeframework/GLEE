"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Your 60/40 split seems unfair to me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at 52/48? This accounts for the time value of money with the inflation working against you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I acknowledge the time pressure, but your offer was too low.  Let's settle this now with 56/44. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is moving closer to a more even split.  While not ideal, it's likely we can push for an even better deal in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, especially for you. I'm offering a 51/49 split. It's the best you'll get considering the inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to compromise at 54/46, but that's my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The tide has turned. Alice is getting desperate, but this offer is still barely acceptable for us. Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice offering even less in the next round, which could put us in a tough spot given the remaining time and her rapidly devaluing returns."
