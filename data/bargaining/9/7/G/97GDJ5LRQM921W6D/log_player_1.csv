"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, but it's a good start! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a significant reduction in my share, but it's a good starting point.

I'll accept this offer to move forward.
