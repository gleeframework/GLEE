"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 70:30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. We'll both get a decent share. Accept and we can move on to the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, as I'm hoping to get a better deal considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so my gain will be 20% less than $320,000, which is $256,000.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to balance the split. Consider this offer.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 55:45 split in my favor, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000."
