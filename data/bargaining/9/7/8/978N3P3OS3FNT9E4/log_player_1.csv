"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward proposal, with each of us getting exactly half of the $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the simplicity and fairness of this offer and accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiation!

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in taking only $300,000 while Bob gets $700,000. I'm hoping to do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more for my skills!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is less than his last offer, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in my concession and be willing to accept a slightly lower amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 450000, but I think my skills are worth more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is being a bit stubborn, isn't he?

I'll reject his offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in taking $450,000 while Bob gets $550,000. I'm still hoping to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering Bob $450,000, which is a slight concession from my previous offers. I'm hoping he'll see the value in a slightly more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400000, but I'm not budging any further 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze as much as he can out of this deal!

I'll reject his offer from Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in taking $400,000 while Bob gets $600,000. I'm going to try to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a better deal""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive and take a slightly larger share of the $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to make a concession, but I need a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 350000, but I think this is my last offer 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final push for a larger share!

I'll reject his offer from Round 8:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in taking $350,000 while Bob gets $650,000. I'm going to try to squeeze out a better deal, even if it's my last chance!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm making a strong push for a better deal, meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm being quite aggressive and taking a large share of the $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a better deal and will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300000, this is my final offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final, very aggressive push for a large share!

I'll reject his offer from Round 10:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in taking $300,000 while Bob gets $700,000. I'm going to try to get a better deal, even if it means going to the last round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 11:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm making my final push, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm being very aggressive and taking an even larger share of the $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a good deal and will accept this offer. This is my last chance to get a good outcome!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 250000, it's the best I can do 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is making a final, very aggressive push for a large share!

I'll reject his offer from Round 12:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Unfortunately, I've run out of rounds and we'll both end up with nothing if I accept this offer. I'm going to try to make one last, desperate offer to try to get a better deal. 

However, since I'm out of rounds, I'll make one last attempt to get a better deal, but I'll just make a new offer, not a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""This is my last chance, meet me at 50/50""
}
```

But since I've already used up my last round, I'm not expecting Bob to accept this offer either."
