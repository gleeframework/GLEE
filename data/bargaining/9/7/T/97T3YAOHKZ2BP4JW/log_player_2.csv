"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take 1000 and let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very unfair offer, and Bob has a lot to gain by waiting for his turn to propose.  While the money decreases in value for Bob, he still has a chance to get a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share than this.  Let's split it 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal,  Bob is losing a lot of value each round. It's better to take the 4500 now and avoid the risk of getting less in the next round."
