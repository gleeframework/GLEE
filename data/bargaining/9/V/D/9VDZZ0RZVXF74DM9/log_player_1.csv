Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as I am the one taking the risk of the offer being rejected and potentially losing out on a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I acknowledge the inflation impacting my potential gains, I believe this offer is still fair considering the risk Bob took in rejecting my previous offer. I am willing to compromise to reach a solution."
