"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money and Bob only 10%. I'm starting with a bold proposal to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share right away. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, the inflation is making this offer worse for me with every passing round. I will wait and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation. I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share to incentivize him to accept. Let's see if this is enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. The inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, and Bob is offering a very small share. However, if I reject, the inflation will continue to eat away at my potential gains. It's a risky move, but I'm going to accept this offer and take what I can get."
