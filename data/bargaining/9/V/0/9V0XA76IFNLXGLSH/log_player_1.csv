"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars, which is a 30% share of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, let's try that again! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is willing to compromise!

Considering the inflation, the offer is now:

* Alice gain: 500,000 (20% less than the original 700,000)
* Bob gain: 450,000 (10% less than the original 500,000)

I'll accept this offer. The game is over, and we can split the money!
