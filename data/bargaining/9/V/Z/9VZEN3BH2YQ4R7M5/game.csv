70.0,30.0,I propose dividing the $100 in a 70-30 ratio. I believe this is fair considering the risk and potential inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I propose a 55-45 split. This is a fairer split that accounts for the potential for inflation in the next rounds. Let's end this quickly and avoid further devaluation.,Bob,2,
