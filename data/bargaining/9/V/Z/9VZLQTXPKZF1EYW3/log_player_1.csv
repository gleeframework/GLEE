Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer. I want to get the majority of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with something so he doesn't immediately reject it. The inflation will work to my advantage in the later rounds if he rejects this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I can do better.  I know he's willing to negotiate, and with the inflation working against him, I can push for a larger share in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but still offering Bob a decent amount to encourage him to accept. The inflation is working in my favor, so I'm aiming for a higher share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm confident that I can push for a larger share, especially with the inflation hitting him harder.  I'm going to continue to hold out for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to push for a larger share again, but still offering Bob something to keep him from completely rejecting the offer.  The inflation is significantly hurting Bob now, so I believe he may be more willing to accept a deal closer to my terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, and the inflation is really starting to hurt me now.  I think I'll take this offer before things get worse."
