"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the math works out in later rounds before accepting an unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out. Take it or lose it!""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  Both our potential gains decrease rapidly each round. It's in my best interest to secure a good deal quickly.
* **Alice's disadvantage:**  Her share is devaluing faster than mine. This round, she might be tempted to take a slightly smaller amount rather than risk a worse offer later.
* **Future leverage:** By starting with a strong offer, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a bad deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do better than your generous offer 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to call my bluff and capitalize on my previous generosity. While her offer is better than her first, it's still not in my best interest considering the faster devaluation of her share. I need to push for a more favorable split before time runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Time is running out! This is my final offer. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm mirroring Alice's previous offer to show flexibility but also stand my ground. This avoids appearing greedy and potentially pushing her away from a deal. 
* **Urgency:**  Highlighting the dwindling value emphasizes the need for a quick resolution. 
* **Finality:**  Declaring it my ""final offer"" introduces a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to accept before the deal potentially gets worse for her in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you another chance 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking no deal and getting $0. The difference between our shares is getting less significant with each round due to the faster devaluation of Alice's portion. 
* **Alice's Position:**  Her willingness to negotiate after I declared a ""final offer"" shows she is feeling the pressure of the dwindling pot. It's unlikely she will offer significantly more in subsequent rounds.
* **Time Pressure:** With seven rounds remaining, there's still a risk of reaching an impasse and losing everything. Accepting now secures a reasonable, albeit not perfect, payout."
