{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go any higher 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as I was hoping for a more even split. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
