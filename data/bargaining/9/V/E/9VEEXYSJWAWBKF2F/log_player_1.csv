"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 300k and take the rest.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob 30% of the initial amount, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I'll keep most of it. You can't expect a fair split at this point. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer, hoping he'll be more generous."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth even less now. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it roughly 55/45. It's a fairer deal than his previous offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but I still want to keep a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. You're not getting the better end of this deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still quite biased towards him, but I'll consider it. The money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, and I need to think about the diminishing returns.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for his next proposal. I'm hoping he'll become more generous as the rounds go by."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up. Let's split it 50/50. It's the only fair way to end this.""
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering a 50/50 split, but I think it's worth it to try to get a more equitable deal."
