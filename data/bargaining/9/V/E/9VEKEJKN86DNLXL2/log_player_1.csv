Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. It's obvious we both lose out if this drags on. 50/50 is the only fair outcome. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50

This is a good time to accept the offer for a couple of reasons:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, Bob's potential gains decrease significantly. While you're not feeling the pressure yet, he's likely getting desperate for a deal.
* **Fairness:** While a 55/45 split in your favor would have been ideal, a 50/50 split is objectively fair. Holding out for more might backfire and lead to Bob making even riskier proposals."
