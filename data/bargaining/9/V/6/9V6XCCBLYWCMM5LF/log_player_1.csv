"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
