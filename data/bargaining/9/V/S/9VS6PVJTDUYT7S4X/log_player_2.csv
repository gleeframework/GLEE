**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking to getting a larger share, even though the value is decreasing rapidly.  While the difference is getting smaller, it's worth holding out a bit longer to see if she becomes more reasonable.  There's still a significant amount of money to be lost to inflation if we don't settle soon."

Round 6

{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This is my final offer - a near even split.  Let's be smart and take the money before it's worthless!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on. I'm making a final push with a near-even split but still giving myself a slight edge. This emphasizes the urgency and the fact that we both lose if she keeps pushing for a significantly larger share."
