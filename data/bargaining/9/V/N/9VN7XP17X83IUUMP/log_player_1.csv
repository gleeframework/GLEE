"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. No need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise, and meeting in the middle seems like a fair approach. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
