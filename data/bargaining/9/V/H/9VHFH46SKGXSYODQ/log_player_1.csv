Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial amount, which is a fair starting point, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I get 40% of the current value, which is $400,000, and Bob gets 60% of the current value, which is $600,000.
