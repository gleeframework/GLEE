```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40, let's see if we can do better later. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll need to be more cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 40%. I'll wait for his next proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll aim for a higher percentage this time. Here's my offer:

# Bob's message: I'll take 55, you can have 45, it's a fair split, but I'm not giving up too much ground. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns! With the inflation affecting my gain even more, I'll need to be more cautious. However, his offer is almost identical to mine in the previous round, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that I'm not giving up too much."
