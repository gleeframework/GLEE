# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I feel I'm being offered too little. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is quite lopsided in Bob's favor. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because it's even more lopsided than before. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'll wait for the next round to make another proposal."
