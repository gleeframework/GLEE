"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent chunk to make the game worth his while."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my strategy.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better. The money is worth less, but I still want to get a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round. Since Bob's offer was 400,000 for him and 600,000 for me, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
