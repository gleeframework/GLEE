"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. It's not a bad deal in the first round, but I think I can get a better share with some negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it closer to 55/45 in your favor, but I think we should aim for a fairer split in the long run.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the fairness, but I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not ideal, the inflation is starting to bite, and I don't think I'll be able to get a much better deal.  It's a better offer than the previous one, and getting something is better than nothing."
