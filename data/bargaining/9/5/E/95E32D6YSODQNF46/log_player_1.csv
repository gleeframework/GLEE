"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me the majority, but still a decent share for you 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about getting only $2,000, especially since it's worth less than $2,000 in the first round due to inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.
