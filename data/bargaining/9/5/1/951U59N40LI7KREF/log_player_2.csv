Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. This way, we both get a decent share and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a more even split,  the impact of inflation is becoming significant. Accepting $4,000 now is a significantly worse deal than accepting even $5,000 just one round earlier.  I need to push for a better split while it's still worthwhile."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and the value is dropping fast!  My final offer is 55/45. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With each round, the value decreases significantly.  It's crucial to get Alice to agree quickly.
* **Firmness:**  By presenting this as a ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to signal that I won't accept anything less. This might encourage her to settle.
* **Slight Concession:** This offer is slightly better for Alice than my previous one, showing some movement on my part and potentially making it more appealing."
