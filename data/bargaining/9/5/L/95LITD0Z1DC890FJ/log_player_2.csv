Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. It's fair, and avoids the risk of further rounds. We can both get something rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
