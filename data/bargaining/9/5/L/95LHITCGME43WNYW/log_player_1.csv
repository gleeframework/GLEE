Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's get this done before the money starts to dwindle! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
