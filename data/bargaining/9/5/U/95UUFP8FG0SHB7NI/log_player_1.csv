"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, let's split it 50/50!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, a fair deal for the first round! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only $400,000, but I'm willing to accept it since it's still a decent offer. I'd rather get something now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
