"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable division!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable division, considering we're both starting with the same amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced share, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}.

I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bigger chunk.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $4,500 and Bob receives $5,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's still beneficial for me, while also acknowledging that Bob might be willing to give me a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, let's settle for a fair split now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my purchasing power!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to re-evaluate my priorities. Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}.

I'll take the $4,000 and hope that Bob keeps his word about it being a ""fair split""."
