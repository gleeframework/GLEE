Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced by your offers, let's try to meet in the middle, but I'm not going below 57% 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly fixated on a larger share, but the increasing inflation is making her greed riskier. While her offer is tempting, it's worth holding out a bit longer to see if she'll become more reasonable.  We need to apply more pressure in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 492500,
""alice_gain"": 507500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The value is plummeting with each round. My offer is generous, and you're being unreasonable.  Accept this, or we both lose out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point, and the clock is ticking. Alice's stubbornness needs to be met with a firm response. This offer is still generous, but the message is designed to make her realize the gravity of the situation. We're walking a thin line between pushing for a better deal and scaring her into accepting a worse one later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your frustration, but I'm not budging that much. This is my most generous offer yet. Take it or risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical.  Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much further, and the inflation is eating away at the potential gains rapidly. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable payout, while further rejection carries a very real risk of leaving both of us with nothing. It's time to cut our losses and secure what we can."
