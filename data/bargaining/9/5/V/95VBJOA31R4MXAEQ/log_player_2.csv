Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While her offers are incrementally getting better, accepting now would still give her a significantly larger share. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a more balanced deal and willing to risk it going to later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly even split.  Take it or leave it. I'm not budging.""}

**Reasoning:**

The time for negotiation is over. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting an even split.  By offering 50/50, I'm demonstrating my resolve. She knows that if she rejects this, I'm likely to push for even more in the later rounds, especially with inflation working in her favor. This puts the pressure on her to accept a fair deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offers, now I'm raising the stakes 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball! She's gone back on her previous offers, likely realizing that time (and inflation) is on her side. If I reject this, there's a good chance she'll keep pushing for even less in the remaining rounds. Accepting a 41/59 split is not ideal, but it's better than risking getting even less or even nothing if we fail to agree."
