"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I'm trying to make a fair offer to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it this round, but I'll give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not happy with the drastic difference in the split. I'm looking for a more balanced split, and this offer is too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a more balanced split than the previous offer. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
