"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose taking 90 dollars and giving Bob 10 dollars. I believe this is a fair offer, as I am taking a larger share, but I am still willing to give Bob a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation means my 90 dollars from the previous round is now worth 72 dollars.  It's better to take the 50 dollars now than risk getting less in future rounds."
