# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a terrible offer! Even though it's only the first round, I'm not going to accept such a small share.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice a small share, but it's still more than she offered me in the previous round.  Since I'm the one making the offer this time, I'm going to take a large share. We'll see if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55000 
# Alice gain: 945000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still significantly unfair.  I'm going to reject it and see what she offers next. The inflation is making the money worth less, so I need to be more assertive in getting a reasonable share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping a significant majority of the money.  Inflation is starting to bite, so I need to secure a good share before it gets worse."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 107500 
# Alice gain: 892500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still terrible!  Even though inflation is hurting both of us, this is not a reasonable division.  I'm going to keep rejecting offers like this until I get a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```

Inflation is getting out of hand, but I need to secure a decent share while I still can. This offer gives Alice a larger share than my previous offer, but it's still a significant portion for me. Hopefully, she'll see it's a better deal than her previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 160000 
# Alice gain: 840000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not fair. While the inflation is impacting me more heavily now, I need to hold firm and push for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000} 
```

Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm willing to compromise. This is a 50/50 split. It's the fairest offer we can make, given how much the money is worth less now. I hope Alice sees it as a fair deal."
