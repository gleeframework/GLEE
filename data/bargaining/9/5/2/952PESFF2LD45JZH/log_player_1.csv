"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's each take a little more than half. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 45% is a fair share for me, considering the initial amount is still $100."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Your turn, Bob!"
