"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large share, but it leaves something for Bob, encouraging him to potentially accept it in the first round. This strategy aims to avoid unnecessary rounds and potential inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy at this point. Considering the inflation, my share is now 5% less, but accepting this offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money. Further rounds risk greater losses due to inflation, making this a relatively safe and profitable choice."
