**Reasoning:** Alice is sticking to a pattern of small concessions. We're getting close to the point where she'll be forced to make a significant move to avoid both of us losing everything. I'm betting on her willingness to negotiate further rather than risk getting $0."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is fair and gives you a clear advantage.  Let's not throw away a good deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm returning to my previous offer from Round 4. This creates a sense of consistency on my part and emphasizes the ticking clock.  Alice is likely to feel the pressure and might be more willing to accept a deal she's already rejected once before."
