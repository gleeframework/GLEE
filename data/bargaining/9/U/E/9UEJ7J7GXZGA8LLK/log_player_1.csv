"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, and then we can reassess 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the 50:50 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking.
