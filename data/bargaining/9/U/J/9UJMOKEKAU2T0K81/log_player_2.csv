Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, it's time to settle 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the deal is slightly better than her previous offer, accepting it sets a bad precedent and she's likely to push even further in later rounds.  It's worth the risk of another rejection to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out and the value is decreasing rapidly. Offering a slight advantage to Alice might be the only way to secure a deal before the inflation eats away too much of the potential gains. The ""final offer"" message adds pressure on Alice to accept."
