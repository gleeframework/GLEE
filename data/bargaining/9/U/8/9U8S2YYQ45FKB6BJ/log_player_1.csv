I'm going for a pretty aggressive opening. I'll take the lion's share, but give Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being extremely greedy!  I'm not going to settle for that.  I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is making things more difficult, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still keep a majority for myself.  I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't be taken advantage of.  Let's see if he's finally willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being very unreasonable!  I'm not going to settle for such a small share. I'm hoping that the increasing inflation will finally make him realize that he needs to compromise.  I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower share for myself this time.  I'm hoping that the increasing inflation and my willingness to negotiate will make Bob realize that he needs to compromise. If this doesn't work, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are getting progressively worse, and the inflation is hitting him harder than it is me.  I'm still not going to accept this deal. I'm confident that I can get a better offer in the next round. I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

We're getting close to the end, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. I'm going to offer a 50/50 split. This is a fair deal, and I hope Bob will finally accept it. We're both losing money with every passing round, so we need to come to an agreement."
