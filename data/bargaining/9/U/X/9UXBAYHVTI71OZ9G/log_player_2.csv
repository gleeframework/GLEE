Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for the significant inflation impacting me. Let's find a solution before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is still taking advantage of the situation. While her offer is slightly better, it's crucial to demonstrate that I won't be lowballed.  The inflation is hurting me much more than her, but there's still time to negotiate a fairer deal."
