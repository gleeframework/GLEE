"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly, a bird in hand is worth two in the bush.  Take this generous offer and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Rejecting allows me to make a counter-offer and potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your previous offer didn't reflect the reality of our situation.  This is my final offer, consider it carefully.  Every round that passes hurts you more than it hurts me. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is significantly hurting my potential gains.  It's better to accept this offer than risk getting even less in future rounds."
