"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering the initial amount of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split seems fair, considering we're just starting out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 x 0.95 = 4750
* Bob gain: 5000 x 0.95 = 4750

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer I made was 40% to Bob, which is more than the 50% he's now proposing. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that I rejected Bob's 50/50 split:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's split it 55/45.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more favorable to me than the previous one, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55/45 is too lopsided. How about 48/52? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5200 x 0.859 = 4468
* Bob gain: 4800 x 0.859 = 4126.32

I'm not sure if I like this offer. While it's closer to my original 40% share, I'm not sure if 48/52 is a good enough compromise. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that I rejected Bob's 48/52 split:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's split it 58/42.""

This offer is a bit more favorable to me than the previous ones, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further. How about 44/56? 
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5600 x 0.778 = 4360.8
* Bob gain: 4400 x 0.778 = 3417.2

I'm not sure if I like this offer. While it's closer to my original 40% share, I'm not sure if 44/56 is a good enough compromise. I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to wear me down with a series of offers that are just slightly better than the previous one. I'll reject this offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that I rejected Bob's 44/56 split:

  ""message"": ""I'm starting to think you're not serious about finding a fair split. I'm going back to my original offer, with a slight increase. Let's split it 60/40.""

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm trying to convey that I'm not willing to compromise further without getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up yet. How about 46/54? 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 30.17% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5400 x 0.695 = 3747
* Bob gain: 4600 x 0.695 = 3193

I'm not impressed with this offer. It's not much different from the previous one, and I'm starting to think Bob is just trying to run out the clock. I'll reject this offer.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that I rejected Bob's 46/54 split:

  ""message"": ""I'm not budging. I think I deserve a larger share, considering I've been willing to compromise throughout this negotiation. Let's split it 62/38.""

This offer is even more aggressive, and I'm trying to convey that I'm not willing to give in anymore."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split. I think we can find a better compromise. How about 48/52? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 36.98% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5200 x 0.636 = 3308.8
* Bob gain: 4800 x 0.636 = 3056.8

I'm not sure if I can accept this offer. It's the same offer that Bob made in round 4, and I rejected it then. I'm starting to think that Bob is just reusing old offers in an attempt to wear me down. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that I rejected Bob's 48/52 split again:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,

  ""message"": ""I've been patient, but it's time to take a firmer stance. I'm not willing to accept anything less than a 65/35 split. This is my final offer.""

This offer is my most aggressive one yet, and I'm trying to convey that I'm not willing to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split. I think we can find a better compromise. How about 50/50? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 43.12% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 x 0.568 = 2840
* Bob gain: 5000 x 0.568 = 2840

I'm not sure if I can accept this offer. It's a 50/50 split, which is the same as Bob's initial offer, and I've rejected it multiple times before. I'm starting to think that Bob is just trying to get me to accept a deal that's not in my best interest. I'll reject this offer.

Round 13
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that I rejected Bob's 50/50 split again:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

  ""message"": ""I've had enough of your games, Bob. This is my final offer. I'm taking 70% of the remaining money, and you can have the rest. If you don't accept, I'm walking away.""
}
```

This offer is extremely aggressive, and I'm trying to convey that I'm not willing to negotiate further. I'm essentially saying that I'll take the majority of the remaining money, and Bob can either accept it or walk away."
