"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'm willing to compromise. I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more than 40%. Let's try to find a better balance.""
}
```

It's my turn to make a proposal for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 55% to me and 45% to Bob, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on the ratio, but I'm willing to give you a bit more to seal the deal 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the ratio, but I'm willing to accept a bit more money to move forward. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, I'll take it. 4500 is better than nothing, and I'm willing to move on.""
}
```

I'll take the 4500 and call it a day."
