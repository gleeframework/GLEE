Let's see what Alice offers next!  I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share. How about a 55-45 split?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer: 58-42 split. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting this offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, the inflation is starting to hurt. It's better to take a slightly less ideal split now than risk losing more in the next round."
