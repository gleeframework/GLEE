I'll offer to take $9000, and leave $1000 for Bob.  I figure this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $8000 for myself and $2000 for Bob.  Since Bob's offer was so lopsided in his favor, I figure it's time to show him that I won't be taken advantage of.  We're still both better off than if we keep rejecting each other's offers, given the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject again. While Bob's offer is slightly better for me than his last one, it's still a huge disparity and it's clear he's trying to take advantage of the inflation situation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if he's willing to be more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a larger share. With the inflation increasing, I need to secure a good portion of the money before it's worth significantly less. This offer still gives Bob a decent share, and it's time for him to be more reasonable with his offers if he wants to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with this offer, the inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money. It's better for me to accept and secure at least $3000 than risk getting nothing if we continue to reject each other's offers.  I'm hoping Bob realizes that we're both losing out in this game, and that we need to find a compromise."
