Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. Since the money is worth less with each round, let's divide it fairly and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
