Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the negotiation, but your offer was a bit too far in your favor.  How about a 55/45 split? It's closer to the middle ground and accounts for the time value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
