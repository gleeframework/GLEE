"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the new amounts are:

Alice's gain: 400,000
Bob's gain: 600,000

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 20,000 from the previous round, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the new amounts are:

Alice's gain: 300,000
Bob's gain: 700,000

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I can accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than going to the next round and risking even less value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
