"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think we can both agree on this""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split, let's try this 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as I think it's still quite skewed in his favor. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing that I get $45 and Bob gets $55. I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and I think this is a reasonable compromise."
