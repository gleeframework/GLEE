"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a classic ""take it or leave it"" approach.  Since inflation is a factor, I'm trying to secure the vast majority of the money in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, the inflation factor means that Bob's offer is the best I can hope for.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances."
