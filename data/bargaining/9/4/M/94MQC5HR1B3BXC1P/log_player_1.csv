I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a small share to incentivize acceptance, while securing the majority for myself. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer a larger share, with inflation eating into my potential gains,  a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all."
