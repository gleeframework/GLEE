Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, time to be fair. Let's split it evenly and call it a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 
 
This is a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Delaying further significantly eats into potential gains for both of you.
* **Fairness:** While not ideal, a 50/50 split is fair on the surface. Accepting ensures you get something substantial before inflation makes it insignificant.
* **Risk:**  Continuing carries the risk of Bob proposing increasingly worse deals, hoping you'll panic as the deadline approaches."
