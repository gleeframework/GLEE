"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate further if you want.

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. 70/30 split in my favor. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid further inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Since the inflation only affects me, time is on her side.  I need to push for a more equitable split quickly."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 5500,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each passing round. Let's split it 65/35,  a decent compromise that will give us both a good amount and help us avoid further losses. Let's end this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is using the inflation threat effectively, but she's still trying to take a significantly larger share. While a 65/35 split is tempting to avoid further losses, I need to hold out for a better deal.  It's risky, but I believe I can get Alice closer to a 60/40 split in my favor."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Alice, we're reaching a critical point. I'm proposing a 58/42 split. This is a serious offer and my final concession.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses due to inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money rapidly.  Let's be practical and split it 60/40. It's a fair compromise given the current situation and avoids further losses.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice has finally moved to a 60/40 split, which is the best I could realistically hope for at this stage. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of getting a worse deal or even losing everything as inflation eats away at the potential gains."
