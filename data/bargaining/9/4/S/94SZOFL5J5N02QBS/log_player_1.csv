Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my first offer. I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself, but offering Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept. I'm hoping he doesn't know about the inflation yet, so this might seem like a fair deal to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is better than my initial proposal.  While the inflation reduces the value of the money, a 50/50 split is still a fair outcome. I'd rather take half the money than risk getting nothing at all in future rounds."
