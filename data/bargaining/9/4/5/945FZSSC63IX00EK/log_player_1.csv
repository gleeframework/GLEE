"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small share, but I'll still be rich! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can get away with a 90/10 split?

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 90% of the money, especially since the money is already decreasing in value due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent deal!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 60/40 in my favor, but still offering Bob a significant share of the money. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm getting desperate?

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The 30/70 split is still too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to give up such a large share of the money, especially considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, let's compromise!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55/45 in my favor, trying to find a more balanced compromise that works for both of us. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take the smaller share! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is sticking to his guns, huh?

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The 40/60 split is still not favorable to me, and I'm not willing to accept a smaller share of the money, especially since the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's go back to the original 50/50 split, it's only fair!""
}
```

I'm reverting back to the initial 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the deal."
