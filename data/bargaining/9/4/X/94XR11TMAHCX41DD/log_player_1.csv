I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping Bob will accept.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy if necessary.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm not going to accept that. He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still try to get a decent share.  I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and not risking Bob taking all the money if we go too many rounds.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse!  It's clear that he's not willing to compromise at all. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, even with the inflation.  I'm going to hold out for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm going to continue lowering my offer, but I'm still aiming for a decent share. Bob is clearly being unreasonable, but I need to be careful not to get stuck with nothing due to the inflation.  Let's see if he's willing to budge."
