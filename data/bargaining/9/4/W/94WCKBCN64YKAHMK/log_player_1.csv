"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4,000$ and keeping 6,000$ for myself. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's your turn to make a tough choice! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, and Bob's offer is trying to take advantage of that.

I'm not going to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You tried to lowball me last round, now it's my turn to make a strong counteroffer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4,500$ and keeping 5,500$ for myself. This is a slightly more aggressive offer than the first round, but I'm hoping it's still reasonable enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to make up for last round's lowball, but I'm not getting too generous 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll! Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him this time around.

I'm not going to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not willing to give in just yet. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle! Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day.""
}
```

I'm going for a fair split this time, offering Bob 5,000$ and keeping 5,000$ for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable compromise that Bob will accept."
