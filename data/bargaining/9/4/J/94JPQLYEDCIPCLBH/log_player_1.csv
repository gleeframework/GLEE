Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. How about this split? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is heavily skewed in Bob's favor, especially with inflation working against him. Let's see if we can negotiate for a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5600,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. This even split ensures we both benefit significantly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This seems like a trap. Bob knows the inflation is hitting him harder.  While on the surface a 50/50 split appears fair, it actually benefits him significantly more now due to the rapid devaluation of his potential earnings.  I need to push for a larger gain while it's still worth something!
