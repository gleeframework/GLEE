"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\nI offer a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept the offer as it is a relatively fair division. Since there are 12 rounds and the money loses value for me with each round, I'm starting with a slightly higher offer for myself to account for the potential loss in value over the rounds. This also gives room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel he has a chance to get a better deal if he chooses to continue. The message ""Let's share fairly"" aims to set a tone of cooperation and reasonableness, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should prioritize your share due to the inflation impacting you. This offer ensures a significant portion for you before it diminishes further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his considerate message, the proposed division of 40% for me and 60% for him is too skewed in his favor, especially considering the impact of inflation on my share. Accepting this offer would mean I lose out significantly due to the 10% devaluation from the first round, and it doesn't adequately compensate for the future rounds' potential devaluations. By rejecting, I aim to push for a more balanced distribution in the next rounds, leveraging the fact that Bob doesn't lose value over time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a fairer split to account for the loss in value.""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to a 52-48 split in my favor, slightly reducing my share from the initial offer to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while also considering the impact of inflation on my potential gain. The message aims to convey my awareness of the devaluation of the money for me and my need for a more balanced split to compensate for this loss. By being transparent about my considerations, I'm trying to appeal to Bob's understanding and encourage him to accept this offer as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage. This offer is a compromise to account for that while still being fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer in round 4 because, although he acknowledges the impact of inflation on my share and frames his offer as a compromise, the proposed 45-55 split still doesn't adequately address the 27.1% devaluation I've incurred up to this point. Accepting this offer would mean I end up with significantly less value than Bob, considering the cumulative effect of inflation. By rejecting, I aim to continue negotiating for a split that more equitably accounts for the disparate impact of inflation on our shares, hoping to leverage the remaining rounds to reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Despite the inflation, I'm willing to meet in the middle to ensure we both walk away with something. This is as fair as it gets.""}\n\nIn round 5, I decide to offer a 50-50 split, meeting Bob exactly in the middle. This is a strategic move to test Bob's willingness to settle on an equal division, emphasizing fairness and the mutual benefit of walking away with a substantial amount. The message is straightforward, highlighting the compromise I'm making despite the increasing devaluation of the money for me. By doing this, I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept, considering we're halfway through the rounds and the risk of ending up with nothing if we don't agree."
