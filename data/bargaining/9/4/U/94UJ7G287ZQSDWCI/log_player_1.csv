"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a strong offer that heavily favors me (Alice). Here's why:

* **Time Advantage:** I know that the value of the money decreases for both of us with each round, but it decreases faster for Bob. This gives me a time advantage.
* **Greed vs. Logic:**  Bob might be tempted to hold out for a better deal in later rounds. However, by offering him something upfront, I'm hoping to appeal to his sense of logic. Even a small amount now is better than risking getting nothing if we go through many rounds. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure what you're thinking, Alice, but this is a much fairer deal. We can avoid further negotiation and both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

That's a terrible offer! While Bob's perception of the deal's fairness is skewed by the inflation affecting him, I need to remain rational.  There's no way I'm accepting a deal where I get a mere 10%. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better outcome. It's my turn to propose now, and the pressure is slightly on Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is a good offer considering the circumstances.  Every round that passes hurts you more than it hurts me.""
}
```

Here's my strategy:

* **Concession (Slight):** I'm coming down from 950,000 to 800,000 to show some flexibility. However, this is still a division heavily in my favor.
* **Reminder of Inflation:** I'm explicitly reminding Bob about the inflation factor, highlighting that time is not on his side. 
* **Firm but Fair Tone:**  The message aims to sound reasonable while also conveying that I'm serious about securing a good deal for myself.

Let's see if Bob takes the bait this time!"
