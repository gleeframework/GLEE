# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's the only fair solution at this point. I've lost a lot of value already, so let's just end this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
At this point, Bob has lost a significant amount of value due to inflation. While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best option to salvage at least some of the money. It's better to take what's offered than risk losing even more in the next round."
