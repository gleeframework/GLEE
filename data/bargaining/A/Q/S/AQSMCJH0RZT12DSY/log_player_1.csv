"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. This is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  This is a fairer split. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is a good deal for me, considering the money is worth 5% less now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a larger share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bigger risk, but I think this is a fairer split now.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. A 50/50 split is fair, and we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. A 50-50 split is not as good as I'd like, but it's better than getting nothing. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 5000$."
