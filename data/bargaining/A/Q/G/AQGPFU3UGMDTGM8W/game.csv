60.0,40.0,Let's make a deal! I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good offer for you considering the money will be worth less if we wait.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm willing to make a deal, but I think 60/40 is unfair. How about we meet closer to the middle?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a fair deal. However, the value of the money decreases significantly for me with each round. I propose a 55/45 split, which is a compromise considering the time pressure and inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"I see you're feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm not budging that much. My new offer is 58/42, take it or we'll keep playing.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and the deal is getting worse for me with every passing round.  I'm willing to come down slightly to 52/48.  Let's be reasonable and close this out.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm not feeling the pressure, but you are. My offer is now 60/40. You should take it before it gets even worse for you.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The value is slipping away with every passing moment. I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  Take it before we both lose out!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,accept
