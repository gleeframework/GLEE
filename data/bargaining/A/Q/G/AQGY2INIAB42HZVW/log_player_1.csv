"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the money. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split.  I'm willing to give you 40% of the money if you accept this offer.  Let's end the game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to offer the same deal as I did in the first round! I'll reject this offer since I was hoping for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in round 2, so it's worth 95% of the money from round 2.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I still want a bit more. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
