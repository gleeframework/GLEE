It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal. I'll see what Alice's next offer is."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think we can do better than a 60/40 split.  I'm willing to give you 40% of the money if you accept this offer.  Let's end the game.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I still want a bit more. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 6200 
# Alice gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than my previous one, and it seems like she's willing to negotiate. I'll take the 6200 and end the game."
