"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer
Given the rules of the game, it's crucial to consider the impact of inflation on both players. Since the value of money decreases by 5% for Alice and 10% for Bob with each passing round, the initial offer should aim to capitalize on this advantage while remaining reasonable to avoid immediate rejection.

### Step 2: Calculate the offer
A strategic approach for Alice is to offer Bob a sum that is slightly less favorable to him, considering the depreciation of value for both, but still enticing enough to be considered. A common strategy in such games is to offer a split that slightly favors the proposer but is not so skewed that it leads to automatic rejection.

### Step 3: Formulate the message
The message should be concise, explaining the rationale behind the offer. Given the decreasing value of money, the message should hint at the benefit of accepting the offer early to maximize the value for both parties.

### Step 4: Finalize the offer and message
Considering the strategic approach and the need to entice Bob into accepting the offer, Alice decides on a division that slightly favors her but is reasonable for Bob to consider, especially given the looming threat of further depreciation.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Early agreement benefits both, given the decreasing value over rounds.""
}
```"
