55.0,45.0,"Let's split fairly, Bob. I get $55 and you get $45. It's important to settle this quickly because the value of the money decreases with each round.",Alice,1,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want this settled quickly. I'm willing to compromise slightly. I'll take $52, you take $48. Let's avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
