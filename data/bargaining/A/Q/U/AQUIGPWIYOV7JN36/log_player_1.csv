"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle and be done with it! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll have to consider whether it's better than my previous offer, taking into account the 10% inflation.

Let me calculate the effective value of my previous offer, considering the 10% inflation:

900,000 * 0.9 = 810,000

Comparing this to Bob's offer, I see that I would get 500,000, which is less than the effective value of my previous offer. Therefore, I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal this time, Bob! Accept it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller amount than before, but still a significant portion of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting taken advantage of. You're getting a better deal than me, but I'll give you a slightly better offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of my previous offer, considering the 27.1% inflation:

800,000 * 0.727 = 581,600

Comparing this to Bob's new offer, I see that I would get 700,000, which is more than the effective value of my previous offer. Considering Bob's message, it seems he's trying to be more generous, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

However, I'm not sure if I should wait for another offer or accept this one. Since I have 8 rounds left, I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will make a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You said I'm getting a better deal, but I'm giving you a better one now! Accept it!""
}
```

I'm mirroring Bob's previous offer, giving him the same amount he offered me, and taking the same amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of again. 
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of my previous offer, considering the 40.95% inflation:

700,000 * 0.5925 = 414,750

Comparing this to Bob's new offer, I see that I would get 750,000, which is more than the effective value of my previous offer. Considering Bob's message, it seems he's trying to be more generous, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that Bob might be trying to wear me down. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will make a better one.

# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough. I'm starting to get desperate, but I'm not going to give up yet. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of my previous offer, considering the 52.17% inflation:

600,000 * 0.4758 = 285,480

Comparing this to Bob's new offer, I see that I would get 800,000, which is more than the effective value of my previous offer. Considering Bob's message, it seems he's getting desperate, but I'm not sure if I should trust him.

However, I'm running out of time and I don't want to end up with nothing. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will hold up his end of the deal.
