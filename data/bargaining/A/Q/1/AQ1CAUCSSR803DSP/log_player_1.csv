I'm going for a greedy approach in the first round. I'll take 90% and give Bob 10%.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept.  While I'm getting less than I initially proposed, the inflation means I'm getting 10% less of what I proposed, and the money is worth less.  Taking 50% now is better than risking getting nothing in future rounds."
