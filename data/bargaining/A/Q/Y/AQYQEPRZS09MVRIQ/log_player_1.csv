"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This is a straightforward proposal that splits the $10,000 evenly between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 90% of the original $5000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $4500. This is a better deal than the original 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being generous either""
}
```

This offer is a compromise between the original 50/50 split and the 60/40 split Bob offered in round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4500 is worth 73.1% of the original $5000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $3655.50. This is a better deal than my previous offer, and it's a compromise between the 50/50 split and the 60/40 split Bob offered in round 2.

I'll accept this offer.
