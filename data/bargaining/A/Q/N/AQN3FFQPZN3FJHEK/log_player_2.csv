"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate later 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair at the moment, it's important to remember that with each passing round, the money will be worth less. Since Bob only loses 5% per round, it's worth holding out to see if he can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be a little more equal. I'm willing to take a bigger share this round, but I think we can find a better solution for both of us later on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle, we can adjust later 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like to hold out for a larger share, it's getting riskier with each round. Accepting the 50/50 split ensures I get something, and allows for potential adjustments later. The inflation rate is hurting Alice more than me, so she might be more willing to negotiate in the future."
