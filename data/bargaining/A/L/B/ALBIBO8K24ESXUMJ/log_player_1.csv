"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a very unfair offer to Bob.  Since the money inflates so much more for him, I want to get as much as possible in the first round.  I'll see if he's willing to accept a paltry 1 dollar!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though Bob is being incredibly generous, this is a good time to take a risk since his money is losing value much faster.  He'll be more incentivized to negotiate with me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still keep it heavily in my favor.  Bob's money is losing value quickly, and I want to see if he's willing to settle for a small share now to avoid getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly more generous than my previous offer.  While I would ideally like more, the inflation rate is making it increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  I'll take the 10 dollars and be happy with it."
