"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 60%, I'll take 70% this time. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiations!

Considering the inflation effect, the $300,000 I would gain is actually worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is still a significant amount.

However, I'm not thrilled with the 70-30 split in favor of Bob. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a big swing in your favor. I'd like to propose a 55-45 split, with me getting $385,000 and you getting $615,000.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of its original value.

I'll propose a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll offer a 42-58 split. This way, we both get a decent share of the remaining value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered 42%, I'll counter with a 45-55 split. Meeting in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle.

Considering the cumulative effect of inflation, the $400,000 I would gain is worth 0.95^3 = 0.857375 of its original value, which is approximately 85.74% of the original amount.

While the 45-55 split is a reasonable compromise, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if we're meeting in the middle, Bob. I'd like to propose a 47-53 split, with me getting $434,000 and you getting $566,000. Let's see if we can get even closer to the middle.""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 14.26% less than in the previous round, so the total amount is now worth 0.95^4 = 0.81450625 of its original value.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 435000,
  ""bob_gain"": 565000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to the middle. I'll offer a 43.5-56.5 split, with me getting $435,000 and you getting $565,000. Let's see if we can finally agree on a deal.""
