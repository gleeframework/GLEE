Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, considering Bob's money will be worth less with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, this offer is still good considering the inflation. Taking 8000 is better than risking getting less in the next round, especially since Bob's money is depreciating at a much faster rate."
