"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the 100$ and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to 47.5$ in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, since I was hoping to get more. But I don't want to reject it and risk losing even more in the next round.

I'll accept this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
