"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively equal split, but I'm giving myself a slight advantage to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a slightly better split. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $7,000 is worth $5,600 (80% of $7,000) and Bob's gain of $3,000 is worth $2,700 (90% of $3,000).

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
