Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but your starting offer was too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to move a bit more. This offer reflects a fair split considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, you got yourself a deal. Let's not risk losing it all to inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is now bordering on acceptable.  Here's why accepting is the safer play:

* **Time Pressure:** There are only 8 rounds left. Continued rejection increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I lose another 10% of value next round, Bob only loses 5%. The gap between our gains is shrinking faster than the overall pot.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer more in subsequent rounds. He might dig in, making this the best deal I can get.

It's a tough call, but at this point, securing something is better than risking everything on an increasingly unfavorable gamble."
