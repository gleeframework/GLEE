Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. I'm reducing my share by a significant amount, but I'm hoping he'll recognize that his offer was too aggressive and that we need to find a more equitable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn, but at this point the inflation is hurting me more than him. I'm going to reject this offer again and see if he'll come down."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm going to try one more time to reach a compromise. I'm lowering my share even further, but I'm hoping Bob will see that we need to make a deal before the inflation erodes our gains completely."
