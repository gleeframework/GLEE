I'm offering a pretty generous split in the first round. I'm hoping to secure a good chunk of the money early on, before inflation starts to bite.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a huge power grab! I'm not going to accept such an unfair division, especially since inflation is already eating away at my potential gains. I'll take my chances and propose a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time, even though I'm facing inflation.  I think this offer is fair and hopefully Bob will recognize that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the situation, offering me a lower percentage than the previous round.  I'm not going to give in. I'll take my chances and see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time.  Inflation is really starting to hurt, and I think a fair division is the best way to maximize what we both get at this point."
