"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to seal the deal!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70$ and Bob will get 30$. The message is a friendly opening offer, hoping to seal the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 50$ is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'll actually get 47.5$. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if meeting halfway is the best idea, considering I can still try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my money is now worth 90.25% of its original value, so I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, but still offering a decent share to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up! My 40$ is now worth 86.75% of its original value, so I'll actually get 34.7$. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob's message suggests he's willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer and take the 34.7$ share."
