"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I want to secure as much of the initial money as possible. This leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my previous offer, and while inflation hurts my potential gains, it hurts Bob's gains even more. I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, recognizing that inflation is impacting both of us. However, I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money, knowing that Bob is incentivized to accept a deal rather than risk further devaluation."
