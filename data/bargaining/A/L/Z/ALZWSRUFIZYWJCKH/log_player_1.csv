"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly suggestion to start with a fair split and move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, given the inflation rates. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the new split. I'd like to see a more significant adjustment for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make my next proposal in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, the money is now worth even less for me. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 510,000$ and keeping 490,000$ for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to accept this slightly more generous offer."
