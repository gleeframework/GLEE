"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is 5400. However, I still don't think this is a good deal for me.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my offer in this round will be worth 90% of what it was in the previous round.

  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of 4000 is now worth 73.09% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately 7310. However, considering the inflation, the effective value of my gain is actually 90% of 7310, which is 6581.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I think I'm giving up too much value.
