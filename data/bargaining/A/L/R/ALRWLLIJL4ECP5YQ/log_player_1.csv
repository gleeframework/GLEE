"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping you'll be reasonable and accept.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to start, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50/50 split is a bit too generous for me, given the inflation. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting my counteroffer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure a 50/50 split is fair, considering the inflation. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share due to the inflation. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""
}
```"
