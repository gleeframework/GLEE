Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a more equitable split of 60/40.  Given the inflation, it's in our best interest to settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
