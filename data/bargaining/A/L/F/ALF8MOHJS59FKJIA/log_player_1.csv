I'm taking a risk by offering a large share to Bob in the first round. It's possible he'll accept, but if he doesn't, I'll have to make a more favorable offer in the next round to compensate for inflation. I think it's worth it to try to end the game quickly and avoid the risk of further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'm getting a much smaller share than I initially offered, it's still better than what I'd get if I reject and face another round of inflation.  I need to consider the diminishing value of the money and the fact that the game could go on for an unknown number of rounds.  It's better to take the smaller share now and be done with it."
