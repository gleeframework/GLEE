Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 95/5 split.  While I value your willingness to compromise in the first round, this offer is more in line with the value of our respective positions in the game. 
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
