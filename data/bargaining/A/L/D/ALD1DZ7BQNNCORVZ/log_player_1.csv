"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can finish quickly.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to settle for such a small share, especially since I know he'll have to offer me more in the next round due to the inflation.  Let's see what he does next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly, but I'm confident Bob will see the value in getting anything at all, especially with inflation continuing to hurt him more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to be greedy! I'm not going to accept such an unequal offer, especially with the inflation hitting me harder now.  Let's see if he'll finally come to his senses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share for myself, but I'm still trying to be fair. I think Bob is starting to realize that he needs to be more reasonable, and this offer might just convince him.  Let's see if he finally accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the situation! I won't accept such a low offer, especially with inflation hitting me so hard now. I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but it's getting increasingly risky with inflation.  I think Bob is finally starting to see that he needs to compromise if he wants anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn, and it's clear he's not taking the inflation seriously. I'm not going to settle for a deal that gives him such a large share, especially with the value of my money decreasing so drastically.  I'm going to push for a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a risky move with inflation hitting us both hard, but I think it's time to go for an even split.  Bob is clearly not willing to be reasonable, and I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to reject his offers. This is my last stand for a fair deal."
