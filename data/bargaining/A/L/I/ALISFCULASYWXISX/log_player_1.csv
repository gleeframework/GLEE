"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, you can't refuse!""

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll regret rejecting my offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... Considering the inflation, the money I would gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so 480,000$ in today's value. And Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I think I can do better.

I'll reject the offer and wait for the next round.
