Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  He gets a small slice of the pie, but I want to secure the deal quickly and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly worse than my original offer. Even with inflation, I would be better off waiting for another round and proposing a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still keeping the majority for myself. I'm hoping that after seeing his offer rejected, he'll be more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse.  Even with inflation, I'm still better off waiting for my turn to propose a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering an even split this time.  Inflation has been eating away at my potential gains, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally realize that we both need to compromise for a better outcome."
