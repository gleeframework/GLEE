"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  Let's get this done!  
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob thinks a 60/40 split is fairer now!

However, I'm not convinced. Given the inflation, I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, my proposal for this round is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a bit more for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust the split to account for the inflation, while also nudging the ratio a bit more in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  A 55/45 split is reasonable, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not convinced it's fair, given the inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking its toll, and my proposal for this round is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve more.""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust the split to account for the continued inflation, but I'm not sure if it's enough to sway Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle this 52/48 split. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me halfway again, but I'm not convinced it's a good deal. With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'd like to try to negotiate for more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal, but I'm running out of time and options."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking its toll now, and my proposal for this round is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is as low as I can go.""
}
```

I'm essentially proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will finally accept it, given the severe inflation."
