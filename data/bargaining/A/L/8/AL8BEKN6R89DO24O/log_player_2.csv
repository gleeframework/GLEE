Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, think carefully! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is slightly better than a 60/40 split after inflation is factored in, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal.  Time is running out, but panicking and accepting a bad deal is not the solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5350,

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, don't be stubborn! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me! While this offer isn't great, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to reject and the negotiations go down to the wire. I need to cut my losses and take the deal."
