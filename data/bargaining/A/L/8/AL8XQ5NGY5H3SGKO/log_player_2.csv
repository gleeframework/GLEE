"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get the rest.  We can work it out from here. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit imbalanced. I propose a 60/40 split. It benefits us both to settle this quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. 60/40 is a good middle ground. We both get a decent share, and we can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is now reasonable. Accepting guarantees me $4000, and further rounds risk her offering even less as the value decreases for her."
