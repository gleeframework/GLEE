Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation hurts you way more than me. This offer still gives you something worthwhile before it shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
