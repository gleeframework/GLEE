"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this initial offer, I'm proposing a division where I, Alice, receive $5500 and Bob receives $4500. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is intended to convey a sense of fairness and cooperation, encouraging Bob to accept this offer. Given the impact of inflation on both of us, but more significantly on Bob, this division seems like a reasonable starting point. It gives Bob a substantial amount while also considering my own interests. The goal is to find a mutually acceptable agreement early on to minimize the loss of value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, accepting $4500 in the second round means I'm getting less value compared to if I had accepted a similar amount in the first round. Additionally, Bob's proposed division doesn't take into account the significantly higher impact of inflation on his share. Given that we have more rounds to negotiate and the fact that inflation affects Bob more severely, I believe there's room for a more favorable offer for me in the subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've adjusted the division to reflect the impact of inflation on both of us. Given that Bob's share is worth 20% less with each passing round, and mine is worth 5% less, I've shifted the division to give myself $5800 and Bob $4200. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust"" aims to acknowledge the effect of inflation on our negotiations and to suggest a compromise that takes this into account. It's an attempt to find a middle ground that we can both accept, recognizing that further rounds will only decrease the value of our potential gains."
