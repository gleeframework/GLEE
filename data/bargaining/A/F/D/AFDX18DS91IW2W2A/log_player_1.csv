I propose a 900,000$ - 100,000$ split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair deal, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not happy with this offer.  While the inflation rate is hurting me, I still think I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering a 600,000$ - 400,000$ split in my favor.  This is a more equitable offer than Bob's, considering the inflation we've experienced, and it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a difficult decision, but I think I should accept. The inflation is hurting me significantly, and even though I'd prefer more, the risk of getting nothing is high. I'll take the 450,000$ and hope for a better outcome in the future."
