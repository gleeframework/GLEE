"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money.""
}
```

This way, I get 60 dollars, and Bob gets 40 dollars. I'm starting with a relatively fair proposal, but I'm also trying to get a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the potential for inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to take a slightly more aggressive approach. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that you're considering the inflation's impact on my end. I'd like to propose a 55/45 split, with me getting the larger share.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my previous message, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share to account for the inflation. Let's do 55/45.""
}
```

Note that I'm not changing the ratio, but I'm reducing the absolute amounts to account for the 10% decrease in value."
