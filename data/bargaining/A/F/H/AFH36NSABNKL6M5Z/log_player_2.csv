"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I believe this is a fair offer to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation""}\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation and my willingness to take a risk. I believe 55-45 is a more reasonable split, and I'll attach a message to convince Alice to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation, how about we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this offer carefully, taking into account the impact of inflation on both of our gains. Since the money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, and Alice's gain is worth 19% less, I need to consider whether this offer is better than what I could potentially get in the next round.\n\nPlease give me a moment to calculate the adjusted values.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, my gain of 45 would be equivalent to approximately 40.73 in the first round's value, while Alice's gain of 55 would be equivalent to around 44.45 in the first round's value. Given that the difference between our gains is decreasing due to the higher inflation impact on Alice's side, I think this offer is more reasonable than the previous ones.\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of the money and the risk of further inflation, I'm inclined to accept this offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's finalize the deal! I believe meeting in the middle, as Alice suggested, is a fair compromise at this point."
