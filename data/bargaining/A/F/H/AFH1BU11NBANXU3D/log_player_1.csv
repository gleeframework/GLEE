"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a split of 90 dollars for me and 10 dollars for Bob. This gives me the majority of the money while still offering Bob something.  I believe this is a fair starting point given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm reducing my share slightly to account for the inflation and Bob's rejection of my previous offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still hoping to get a bigger share than 20 dollars.  Since the money is worth significantly less for Bob than the first round, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm trying to keep it above 70%. With inflation hitting both of us hard, I need to secure a decent portion to make it worthwhile. I'm hoping this offer shows compromise and will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still aiming for a bigger share than 30 dollars. While Bob's money is worth significantly less now, his offer is not high enough for me to accept yet. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35} 
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but I'm still trying to get at least 60% of the money. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm confident that I can secure a fair deal if I keep pushing. I'm hoping this offer will finally be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, it's still too low. With inflation hitting me hard, I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile. I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still trying to get more than half of the money. Inflation is really hurting both of us, so I need to secure a decent portion to make it worthwhile. I'm hoping this offer shows my willingness to compromise and will finally be acceptable to Bob."
