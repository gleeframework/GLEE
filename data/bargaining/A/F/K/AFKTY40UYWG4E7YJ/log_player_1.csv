Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's important to remember that Bob will have the power to reject it and make a counter-offer in the next round. We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember that inflation is working against me.  By rejecting, I can make a counter-offer in the next round and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750}
``` 

I'm increasing my share slightly from Bob's offer, but still leaving him with a substantial amount.  This should hopefully be attractive enough to convince him to accept, as inflation will continue to erode the value of the money if we go to another round."
