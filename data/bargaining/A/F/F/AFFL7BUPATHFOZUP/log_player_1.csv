"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is a classic game theory scenario.  I'm starting by offering Bob a small amount, hoping to incentivize him to accept early. This way, I can secure a larger portion of the money while it's still worth more to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than my previous offer, it's still not a good deal for me.  With the inflation rates, I am losing more value than him. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to 750,000 for myself and 250,000 for Bob.  The inflation rate is hurting me more, so I need to try to close the deal sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want. I'm losing value faster than he is, so I'm going to accept his offer and avoid the risk of further inflation."
