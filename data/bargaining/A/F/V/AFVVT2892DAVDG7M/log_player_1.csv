I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in future rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than the one I rejected in round 1. I know the money is worth less with every round, but I'm still in a better position to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my demand slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement and avoiding further inflation."
