"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,""bob_gain"": 45,""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering inflation""}\n\n### \n\nI'll offer Bob 45 dollars and keep 55 dollars for myself. The message I attached is ""Let's split fairly, considering inflation"", to justify why I'm taking a bit more than half. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about inflation, but I think a slightly more balanced split is fair given the faster devaluation for me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's message makes a good point about the faster devaluation for him, I think I can still get a better deal considering the overall impact of inflation on both of us. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52,""bob_gain"": 48,""message"": ""Considering the greater devaluation for you, I've adjusted my offer.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob 48 dollars and keep 52 dollars for myself. My message to Bob is ""Considering the greater devaluation for you, I've adjusted my offer."" This shows that I'm taking into account the faster devaluation of the money for Bob and willing to compromise, but still aiming for a slightly higher share due to the initial conditions. Your turn!"
