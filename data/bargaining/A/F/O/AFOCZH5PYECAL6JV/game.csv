55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation is impacting you less, but your previous offer was too low. This split is more reflective of the decreasing value over time.",Alice,3,

40.0,60.0,Inflation is taking its toll! I think this split is more realistic considering the decreasing value. Let's settle this before it's too late!,Bob,4,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  The value is plummeting with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point, even with the inflation disparity.",Alice,5,
