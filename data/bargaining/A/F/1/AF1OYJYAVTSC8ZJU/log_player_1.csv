Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. I'm being more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob claims this is his final offer, we're only on Round 4.  The pressure is on him too, as he gets nothing if we don't reach a deal.  I'm banking on him getting more nervous and offering a better deal as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This is a fair split considering we both lose if this falls through.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money, Alice - literally! This is a strong offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is really starting to hurt. While this isn't ideal, accepting guarantees me something. If I reject and we don't reach a deal, I get nothing. It's too risky to continue at this point."
