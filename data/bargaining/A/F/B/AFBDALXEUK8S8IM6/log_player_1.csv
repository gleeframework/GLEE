I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I figure it's a good starting point, giving Bob a small share but ensuring a large majority for myself.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Considering inflation, my share is worth less than it would have been in the first round. Additionally, Bob's share is drastically reduced due to inflation.  Accepting this 50/50 split ensures a decent gain despite the reduced value."
