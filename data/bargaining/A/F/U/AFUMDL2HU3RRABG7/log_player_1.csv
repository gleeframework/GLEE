"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! I'll start with a fair split. Will you accept? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing with each round.

I'll think for a moment... Considering the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,000 (since it's 20% less than the $5,000).

I'm not thrilled about the equal split, but it's a fair offer. I'll decide to accept.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
