"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the inflation will make things worse if I keep rejecting."
