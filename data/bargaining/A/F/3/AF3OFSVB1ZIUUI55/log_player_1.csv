"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't get away with a 50/50 split that easily! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being clever!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my gain of $3000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4000. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if I want to give up $7000 to Bob, which is worth 95% of its original value.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $7000 to me (worth 95% of the original), I'll try to counter with a slightly higher offer to him, while keeping my gain lower. I'll also try to make it more appealing by being more conciliatory.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to keep some for myself. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to giving me my fair share, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the offer:

My gain of $4000 is worth 40% of the original $10,000, which is $4000. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 86.67% of the original $10,000, which is $8666.67.

I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $6000 to him (worth 86.67% of the original), I'll try to counter with an even lower offer to him, while keeping my gain slightly higher. I'll also try to make it more appealing by being more conciliatory.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to keep some for myself. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to Bob."
