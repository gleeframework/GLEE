"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $90 for myself and give $10 to Bob.  This is a fair offer considering the risk of inflation and the potential for a better outcome in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept Bob's offer. Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, accepting this offer guarantees me a gain of $10, which is better than risking getting nothing in future rounds."
