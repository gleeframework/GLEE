Let's see what I can do to get a better deal!"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but I need a bit more to account for the rapid inflation hitting me. This is a fair counter-proposal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm not sure Alice fully understands the impact of inflation on her."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, the money is losing value quickly! This is my final offer.  Let's make a deal before it's too late.""}

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! I'm taking a risk here, but this is my final offer. Let's end this now before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject offers.  The inflation is hurting Alice more than me, and we're close to the deadline.  It's better to take what I can get at this point."
