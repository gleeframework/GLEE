This is my first offer. I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm leaving a little for Bob.  We'll see if he's willing to play nice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'm losing out on some money due to inflation, it's still better than risking getting nothing at all if we reach the end of the game."
