Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's start here and see what we can do. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is worse for me than my initial offer, and the money is worth less now!  I need to incentivize Bob to take a deal sooner rather than later.
