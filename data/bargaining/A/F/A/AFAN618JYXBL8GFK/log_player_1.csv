"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll come up with a new proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80%,  you take 20%. It's a fair deal since the money will lose value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I'm trying to maximize my gains. Although the money will lose value with each round, I believe I can do better than a 20% share. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

I'm trying to find a middle ground, as the money is losing value rapidly. I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept this compromise."
