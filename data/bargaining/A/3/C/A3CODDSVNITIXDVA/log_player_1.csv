"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to Round 2. Considering this, my new proposal is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I think I'll take Bob's offer this time. It's a slightly higher share for me than my previous offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.
