"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While the offer is not as favorable as my initial proposal, the inflation factor is significant. My money is worth less with each round, and Alice's money is losing value even faster.
* **Potential for a worse outcome:** If I reject, there's a chance Alice might offer me less in the next round. 
* **Fairness:** While I'd prefer more, the offer is still relatively fair considering the inflation.

**It's a calculated risk, but accepting seems like the best choice in this situation.**"
