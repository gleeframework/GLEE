"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40, which is a relatively fair share, and keep $60 for myself. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" aims to convey that the offer is a sensible starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my turn comes with a cost. Let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain but not mine, I believe I can negotiate for a better share in the next round. Bob's offer of 45 for me and 55 for himself seems less favorable when considering the devaluation of his share over time. I aim to leverage this to my advantage in subsequent negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob a slightly lower amount than before, considering the inflation that affects his gain. I aim to find a balance that Bob might find acceptable, given the decreasing value of his share over time.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer because, despite his claim that a 50/50 split is the only fair outcome, the ongoing inflation affecting his share means that his half is actually worth significantly less than mine. Given this, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal in the next round, as Bob's share continues to devalue.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob a slightly lower amount than before, considering the inflation that continues to affect his gain. Since Bob's share is worth 27.1% less than in the first round and will continue to devalue, I'll aim to find a balance that acknowledges this disparity while still being somewhat appealing to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Given the significant inflation impact, this is a fair adjustment.""}"
