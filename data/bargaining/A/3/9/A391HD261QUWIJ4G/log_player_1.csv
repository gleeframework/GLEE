Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Taking Bob's offer is the best choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round. Waiting longer means getting even less.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While Bob's offer is less than what I proposed in round 3, the impact of inflation makes a significant difference. Accepting $5,000 now is better than hoping for a slightly better deal next round and losing even more to inflation. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal in the future. He seems fixated on a 50/50 split, and further rounds only hurt my position."
