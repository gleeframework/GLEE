"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can seal the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the new total is $9,000.

I'm not too thrilled about the proposal, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can end the game."
