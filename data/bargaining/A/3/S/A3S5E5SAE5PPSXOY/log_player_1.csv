"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a big chunk in the first round. I figure Bob might be tempted to take it since he's losing money faster than I am."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to try to bridge the gap a bit and offer Bob a decent amount, but still keep a majority for myself. We're both losing money faster with each round, so I need to make sure I get a good chunk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being greedy, but the inflation is starting to bite him. I'm not going to settle for such a small share. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000} 
```

I'm lowering my share a bit more, but I'm still aiming for a decent amount. Bob's losing money much faster than I am, so he might be more willing to accept a deal closer to what I want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob is still getting a bigger share, the inflation is taking a huge toll on him.  He's losing much more money than I am, and the risk of getting nothing at all is starting to become a real possibility.  I'll take this offer and secure some money before the inflation completely wipes us out."
