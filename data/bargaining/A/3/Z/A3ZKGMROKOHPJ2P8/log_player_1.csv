"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer. The money is worth 20% less now, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000
* Bob gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000

I'll accept this offer.
