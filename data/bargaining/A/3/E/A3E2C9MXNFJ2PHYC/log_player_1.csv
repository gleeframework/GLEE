"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $160,000 in real terms.

I'll reject this offer. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is too skewed in his favor, and I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer in this round will be worth 20% less than in the previous round, which is 20% of 20% less than the original, or 4% less. So, the effective inflation rate is 20% * 1.2 = 24% less for me.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 180000,
  ""bob_gain"": 820000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $180,000 and Bob receives $820,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small consolation prize, but I'm still the one who deserves the majority 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, my gain of $100,000 is actually worth $51,200 in real terms.

I'll reject this offer. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is still too skewed in his favor, and I'd like to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer in this round will be worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which is 48.8% of 20% less than the original, or 9.76% less. So, the effective inflation rate is 20% * 1.24 = 24.8% less for me.

Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 147840,
  ""bob_gain"": 852160,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still want a decent share.""
