"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's seal the deal!""
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in getting something rather than risking going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the numbers are now:

* Alice gain: 5000
* Bob gain: 5000

I think this is a fair offer, and I'd rather not risk going to the next round. Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
