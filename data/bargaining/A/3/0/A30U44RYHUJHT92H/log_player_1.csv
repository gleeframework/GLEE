Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, and inflation is killing your share. This is my best offer yet. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is far from ideal, it's the best I can realistically expect from Bob at this point. If I reject this offer, the next round leaves me with an even worse deal due to inflation. Bob knows this and is leveraging time and inflation to his advantage. Accepting now cuts my losses."
