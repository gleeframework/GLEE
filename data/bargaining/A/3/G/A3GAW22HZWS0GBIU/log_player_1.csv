"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split, with me taking the larger share, is more equitable given my superior negotiation skills. ðŸ˜‰ 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob thinks his negotiation skills are superior ðŸ˜Š.

Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000$ in Round 2 is actually worth 80% of what I would have gotten in Round 1 (since 20% less is 80% of the original). So, in real terms, I'm looking at a gain of 4800$ in Round 2.

I'm not convinced by Bob's argument, and I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal in Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 80% of what it was in Round 2, so my gain of 5000$ would be worth 80% of what I would have gotten in Round 2, which is actually 80% of 4800$, or 3840$. However, I'll round it to 4000$ for simplicity.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game. Your turn, Bob!"
