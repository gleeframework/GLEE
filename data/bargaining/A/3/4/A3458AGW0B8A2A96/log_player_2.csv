Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was quite cheeky!  Let's be realistic.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Consider that with each round, the value decreases for me, but remains the same for you. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down a bit, but a 60/40 split is still fair considering the inflation and the fact that I'm the one making the proposal this round. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
