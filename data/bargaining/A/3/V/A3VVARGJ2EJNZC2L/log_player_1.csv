"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob, it seems!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it. My gain of 4000 is worth 5% less than my initial proposal of 5000, which is a disadvantage for me. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer from round 1 was 5000, and it's now worth 5% less, which is 4750. I'll try to make a new offer that's a bit more favorable to me, while still being reasonable.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it. My gain of 4800 is worth 14.26% less than my initial proposal of 5000, which is a significant disadvantage for me. Additionally, Bob's gain of 5200 is still a bit more than my proposed gain of 4500 in round 3, which doesn't make me happy.

I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains!

Considering the previous rounds, I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Since my gain in round 3 was 5500, and it's now worth 14.26% less, that's a reduction of 786.5. To make up for this, I'll aim for a slightly higher gain in this round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6286.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 3713.5
}
```"
