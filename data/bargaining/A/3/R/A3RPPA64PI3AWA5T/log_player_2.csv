Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go back to the initial proposal.  I'm not comfortable with the way the inflation is affecting the deal. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to deal with the situation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I could push for a little more, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. Waiting longer means a worse deal even if I manage to get slightly more than 50%.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice seems firm on a roughly even split.  It's unlikely she'll agree to anything significantly better for me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing the game is a gamble.  If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. A 50/50 split guarantees a reasonable payout at this point."
