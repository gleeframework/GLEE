Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's split things a bit more evenly this time. I propose I take $5,500 and you take $4,500. This way we both benefit from a relatively quick agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
