Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm starting with a generous offer to see if Bob is willing to accept, hoping to get the money quickly before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a very unfavorable offer for me. While I'm happy Bob is willing to compromise, the offer is still too lopsided in his favor, especially given the inflation rates. I'll reject this offer and hope for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000. Given the inflation, I need to secure a larger portion of the money for myself.  I'm hoping this more balanced offer will be accepted."
