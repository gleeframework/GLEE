"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large share (900,000$) while still leaving Bob with something (100,000$). I'm hoping this is generous enough for him to accept in the first round, as the value of the money will decrease with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a huge step backwards for me, even though it's still a significant amount of money. I'm taking a big loss in this round due to inflation, so I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 600,000, hoping this will be more appealing to Bob. However, I'm still holding firm on taking a larger share, as the inflation will continue to devalue my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm taking a significant loss due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best option for me.  The value of my share is decreasing rapidly, and it's unlikely I can get a better deal in the next round.  This offer at least secures me a decent amount of money."
