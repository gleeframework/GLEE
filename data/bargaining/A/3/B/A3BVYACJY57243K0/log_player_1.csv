{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can negotiate from here.""

# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a larger share, but is still willing to compromise. My gain of $400,000 is still a significant amount, but I'd like to try to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let's see if we can do better than a 60-40 split.""

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more and more lopsided! My gain of $200,000 is extremely low, and I'd be giving up a huge amount of money. I'd like to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an outrageous offer! My gain of $1,000 is laughable, and I'd be giving up 99.9% of the money. I'm not going to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to accept this ridiculous offer. It's not even worth considering.""
}
```

I'm not going to give in to this absurd demand. Since we've reached the 12th round, I suppose we'll have to accept the default outcome: neither of us gets the money."
