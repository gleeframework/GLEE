Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start with a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given that I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer to get more, accepting a 50/50 split is a much better outcome than getting nothing at all in 12 rounds. Inflation is a real threat, and it's better to secure something now than risk losing everything."
