"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you still get a nice chunk. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better than getting only 10% of the total amount. I'll take my chances with the next round, even though I know the money will be worth less due to inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal""}\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less in this round, the actual value of the offer is $800,000. I'm offering Alice 55% of the original amount, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation. I hope Alice will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
