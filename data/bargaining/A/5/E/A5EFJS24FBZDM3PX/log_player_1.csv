"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

This is a straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly, so we can avoid the inflation effect!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'm not thrilled with the 60/40 split, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
