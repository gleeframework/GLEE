"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a very aggressive strategy, but I'm hoping that Bob, seeing the potential for a much larger share in the following rounds, will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred more, a 50/50 split is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  I'm taking this offer."
