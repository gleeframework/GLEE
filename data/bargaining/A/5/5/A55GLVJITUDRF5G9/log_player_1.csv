"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll think carefully about this offer... Hmm, I'd rather not take the smaller share, so I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% from the first round and another 5% from the second round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm hoping this offer is more attractive to Bob, but I'm not giving up yet!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I think I'll take the risk and accept this one. It's not a great deal, but it's better than nothing, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer later.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
