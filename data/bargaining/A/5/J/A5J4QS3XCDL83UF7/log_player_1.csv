"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10.  I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, as I want to see if he'll accept it quickly.  This will also give me some idea of his risk appetite and how willing he is to gamble on the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair, and since the inflation rate is higher for me than it is for him, I'm better off accepting now than risking another round and potentially getting a worse deal."
