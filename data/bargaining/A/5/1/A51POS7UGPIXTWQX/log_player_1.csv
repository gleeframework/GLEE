"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60% and keep 40%, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I initially proposed a more favorable split, it's clear that Bob is willing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer in Round 2 ensures a gain of $6000, which is still a significant amount.  Furthermore, the inflation rate means that if I reject, I risk getting less in future rounds."
