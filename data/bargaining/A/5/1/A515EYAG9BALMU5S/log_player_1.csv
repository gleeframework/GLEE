"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. This is a fair starting offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not getting a good deal, and I think I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time for my next move!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping he'll accept!"
