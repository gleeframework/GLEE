"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me the vast majority of the money, while still offering Bob a small amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this in the first round, as his share will decrease with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much better for him than mine was, and I know that his share will keep decreasing with each round. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than in my initial offer, but still keeping the majority for myself. Since Bob's share is constantly decreasing due to inflation, I believe this offer might be tempting enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still better for him, my share is decreasing with each round, and his share will keep decreasing as well. At this point, accepting this offer is the most advantageous for me, as I can't be certain that I'll get a better deal in the next round."
