"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 60/40, with me getting the larger share.  This is a fair starting point, given the inflation advantage I have in the early rounds.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation will impact you more heavily in the later rounds. Let's reach a compromise.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this round. The inflation is becoming more of a factor, so it makes sense for us to reach a compromise before it impacts us too much. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
