I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm aiming for a good chunk of the money, but I want to be fair enough to avoid an immediate rejection.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer was for him.  I'm not going to accept this, especially knowing that he's facing an even bigger inflation penalty.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm dropping my share slightly to 700,000, but still offering Bob a significant 300,000. I'm hoping this is a more appealing offer for him, considering his higher inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than his previous offer.  Even with the higher inflation penalty, I'm not willing to settle for such a low share.  I'll try to make a counter-offer that's more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to reach an agreement.  I'm lowering my share again, but this is a considerable amount for Bob, especially given his current inflation penalty. If he rejects this, I'll have to accept whatever he offers in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough choice, but given my inflation penalty and the fact that Bob is likely facing a very high penalty, I'm going to accept this offer.  It's not great, but it's better than risking getting a worse offer in the next round."
