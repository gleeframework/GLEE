"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers in the next round.  300,000 is a bit low, especially considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about the inflation eating away at our profits.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The longer this takes, the less we both get. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. The inflation is hitting us both hard, and 350,000 is still a significant amount.  Let's accept this offer and move on."
