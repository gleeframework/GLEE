I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly. I'm willing to take 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take a bigger share than I offered in the first round, I'm confident that I can get a better deal later. The inflation rate means Bob's offer is worth less than the first round. I'll take my chances and try to secure a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm offering 80% of the money to me and 20% to Bob. This is a compromise after Bob's unfair offer in the previous round, but I'm still hoping to secure a larger share.  The inflation is working in my favor, making the money worth less for Bob than it was before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I accept this offer.  Although inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money, I am willing to accept a 50/50 split to avoid the risk of getting nothing. It's unlikely I'll be able to secure a better deal with the continued inflation and the risk of running out of rounds."
