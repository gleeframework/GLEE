Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm offering you a significant sum to settle this quickly. My turn next round, and inflation is hitting me hard. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or I'll be forced to be even more aggressive next round to counter the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is getting more aggressive, but his offer is still not favorable.  I need to hold firm to push him towards a more equitable split, knowing that the longer the game goes on, the more the shrinking pot will hurt him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking and frankly, your offers haven't reflected the reality of the situation. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand slightly to take advantage of Bob's increasingly desperate position. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm applying pressure for him to accept a deal now before inflation erodes his share even further."
