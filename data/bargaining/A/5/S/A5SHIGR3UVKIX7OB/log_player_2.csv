"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I think I can get a better deal, especially given the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice 400,000 and keep 600,000 for myself. This is a fair split considering I'm taking on the risk of her rejecting the offer and potentially ending up with nothing due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice has taken a significant hit from inflation, so her offer is looking more attractive. I'll accept this offer."
