"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and try to get the majority of the money. I'll give Bob a small portion, hoping he'll be tempted to take it since there's a chance he'll get nothing if he rejects and we move to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer more, it's a fair split and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round, especially with Bob's money losing value faster than mine."
