"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is a decent amount, but not so much that I'm giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you a fair split. Let's end this game quickly! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is 55-45, I'll accept it. The game is worth continuing, but this offer is a good compromise. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
