Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here. Inflation is hitting you hard 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is severely eroding Bob's potential gains.  While the offer isn't ideal, rejecting it and going to another round risks an even worse outcome for Bob. It's likely better to take the guaranteed, albeit reduced, amount now."
