"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  It's the fairest solution and prevents either of us from losing out to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that splitting the money evenly is the best solution. I'm willing to negotiate and try to get a better deal. I think I can get a better offer than 50/50."

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that this offer is a good one for me. I'm still getting less than I was hoping for, and I think I can do better. I'm willing to wait and see if Bob is willing to make a more significant concession."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I've increased my offer again, but I'm concerned about the fast-growing inflation.  We need to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this is a decent offer, considering the inflation and the fact that we're getting close to the deadline. I'm willing to accept this compromise and get a guaranteed $6,000. It's not my ideal share, but it's better than risking getting nothing if we don't agree."
