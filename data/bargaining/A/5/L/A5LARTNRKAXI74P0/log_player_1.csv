"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
 I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering I am the one making the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though I get less than I proposed in the first round, the money is worth less now, and a 50/50 split is a fair deal.  It's better to secure something than to risk getting nothing in the next round."
