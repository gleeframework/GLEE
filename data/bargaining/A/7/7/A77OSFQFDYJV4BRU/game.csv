60.0,40.0,Let's make a deal. I believe a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation we're dealing with. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,"Your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice.  I'm proposing a more balanced 45/55 split.  Let's make a deal and avoid further losses from inflation.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more than it hurts you.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of 60/40. It's important we settle this quickly. Time is literally money in this game!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation is a factor, but I need a fair deal. A 50/50 split is the most equitable solution. Let's settle this now before we both lose out more.",Bob,4,
