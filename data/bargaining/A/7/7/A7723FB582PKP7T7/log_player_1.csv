Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering you $9,000 and Bob $1,000. This is a pretty generous offer for the first round, considering the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer considering the inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and there's no guarantee that I can get a better deal in the next rounds."
