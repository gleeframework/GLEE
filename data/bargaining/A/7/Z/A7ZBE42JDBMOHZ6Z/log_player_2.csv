"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a fair starting point. Let's work together to find a solution we both can agree on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a very unequal split, and while Alice's message is friendly, it's important to remember the game's rules.  Since Bob's money is losing value faster, he should aim for a more equitable split as early as possible."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
