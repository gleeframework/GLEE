I'm going to start with a 95/5 split in my favor. I want to secure a good chunk of the money while still leaving Bob with something to consider.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, his proposed split is still much more favorable to him than my initial offer. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, hoping to secure a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to 70/30. Even with the inflation, this gives Bob a significant share, but it's still a better deal for me than his last offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, taking 300,000 is better than risking getting nothing at all.  Bob's offer is far from ideal, but it's a better outcome than continuing to reject offers and potentially losing everything to inflation.  I'll take the money and run!"
