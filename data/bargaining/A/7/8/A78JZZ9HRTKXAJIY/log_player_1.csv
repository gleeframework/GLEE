"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I'm worth more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 400k is worth 0.9 * 400k = 360k, and Bob's gain of 600k is worth 0.95 * 600k = 570k.

I'm not sure I like this offer. It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain of 500k is now worth 0.9 * 500k = 450k.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and I'll give you a slight edge""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can have 300k 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted values:

My gain of 300k is worth 0.727 * 300k = 218.1k, and Bob's gain of 700k is worth 0.859 * 700k = 600.3k.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as it seems like Bob is trying to take a larger share. However, I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, the money will continue to decrease in value.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
