"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob receives 20%, which is $200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we don't know each other's negotiating styles or preferences yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 80% and you get 20%.  We can both benefit from a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'd be getting $200,000, which is only 20% of the total amount. I'm not getting a great deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse offer.
