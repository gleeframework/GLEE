"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was quite greedy. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in your favor. This ensures you get a good share, and I get something worthwhile before inflation eats away at it too much.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
