"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's actually $3,200. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide.

Since the offer is a 50-50 split, I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
