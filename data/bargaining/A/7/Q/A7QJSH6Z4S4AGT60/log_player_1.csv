"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  No need for more rounds! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
I'm not sure if the even split is fair, considering the inflation affects my gain more significantly. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting my gains more significantly, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Given the inflation, I'm willing to compromise on a slightly lower share. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering the current value of the money."
