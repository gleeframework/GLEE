"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, given the uncertainty of inflation. Let's be reasonable and avoid risking further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
