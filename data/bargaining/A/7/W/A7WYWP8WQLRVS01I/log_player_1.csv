"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! 90% is a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal division! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain would be worth 80% of the original amount, so I'd be getting 720,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

Round 3

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""A compromise: I'll give you a decent share, but I need to secure my own future.""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my own gain with a reasonable offer for Bob."

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain would be worth 51.2% of the original amount (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%), so I'd be getting 512,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's a slightly better deal than before. I'm not sure if I should hold out for a better offer or accept this one.

  ""bob_gain"": 590400,

I'm getting desperate, but I don't want to give up too much. However, considering the value of the money at this point, this offer is not bad. I might as well take it.
