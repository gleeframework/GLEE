"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
