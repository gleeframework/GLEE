"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 40% of the remaining money, but I think you're being too optimistic about inflation. Let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
