Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This ensures a decent amount for me and leaves some room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
