Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation and the risk of inflation.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
