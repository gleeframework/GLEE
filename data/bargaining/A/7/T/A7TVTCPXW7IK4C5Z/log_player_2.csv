Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I'll try to get a better deal. Considering the 20% inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll reassess the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, $45 is equivalent to $71.43 in the first round. However, I'm not sure how to calculate the equivalent value for Alice's gain.

I'll assume the offer is still a 45-55 split, but I'll have to consider the inflation factor for my gain. Given that I rejected the 60-40 split in the previous round, I'll try to get closer to that ratio.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, I'll try to get a bigger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation, I'll reassess the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 59.04% less, $42 is equivalent to $83.92 in the first round. I'm not sure how to calculate the equivalent value for Alice's gain, but I'll assume the offer is still a 42-58 split.

Given the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to get closer to the 60-40 split I initially proposed, but I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
