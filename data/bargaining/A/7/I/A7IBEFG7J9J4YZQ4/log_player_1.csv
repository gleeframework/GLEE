"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $200,000, and I'll take the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I need to consider the effective value of the money.

Since my gain is worth 10% less, $250,000 is now equivalent to $225,000 in the first round's value. And Bob's gain of $750,000 is equivalent to $712,500 in the first round's value.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. The ratio of Bob's gain to mine is 2.86:1, which is quite skewed in his favor. I'll wait for a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer from the first round was 800,000, which is now worth 720,000 in the current round's value. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the current inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the current $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the inflation.

My gain of $600,000 in the first round is now worth 43.4% less, which is equivalent to $343,200 in the current round's value. Bob's gain of $400,000 in the first round is now worth 11.3% less, which is equivalent to $355,600 in the current round's value.

Comparing the offer, Bob is offering me $450,000, which is equivalent to $388,800 in the first round's value. This is more than my current effective gain of $343,200. I'll accept this offer.
