"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split considering the inflation. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting, but waiting longer is risky. 

Let's analyze:

* **Bob's Offer:**  He gets $600,000 (worth $540,000 after inflation) and I get $400,000 (worth $320,000 after inflation).
* **If I Reject:** I'll likely get a better offer in the next round since the pressure is on Bob. However, the value of the money will decrease for both of us.

**Decision:** While risky, I think I can get a better deal.
