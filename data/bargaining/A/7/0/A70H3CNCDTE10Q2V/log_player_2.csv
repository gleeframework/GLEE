Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we meet in the middle a bit? This offer is better for both of us than our previous ones. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be reasonable, but the split needs to be closer to even. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It seems we're at an impasse. Let's be practical and split the money evenly. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

At this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob. Waiting any longer means getting even less in real terms.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better than a 50/50 split, especially with the time pressure.
* **Risk of Losing Everything:** Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of reaching round 12 and getting nothing at all."
