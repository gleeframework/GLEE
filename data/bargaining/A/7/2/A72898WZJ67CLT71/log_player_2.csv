"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small amount and we can both be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob, and it's worth it to see what Alice might offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's get this over with.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and this way we both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a much better offer for Bob than his previous proposal, and it's a reasonable split considering the inflation. Accepting ends the game and gives Bob a decent share."
