"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 900,000$ for myself and giving Bob 100,000$.  This is a good starting point, as it allows for a significant gain for me while still offering Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try and secure a larger share for myself, but I'm also aware that Bob is likely to be more aggressive now. Offering him 300,000 might be enough to get him to accept, as the inflation will be eating away at his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than the previous one, it's still significantly lower than what I initially proposed.  With the inflation, I'm not comfortable accepting such a low share, especially since I have the potential to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, recognizing that Bob is becoming more assertive with each round. I'm hoping that offering him 400,000 will be enough to tempt him into accepting, as the inflation is likely to impact his potential gains significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is a bit lower than I'd prefer, but considering the inflation, my potential gains in the next round are shrinking rapidly. It's best to secure this offer and avoid the risk of getting a worse deal later."
