"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant share to compensate for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. While she is right to consider the decreasing value, we need to aim for a more balanced outcome in the next few rounds.  It's too early to accept a deal this unbalanced."
