"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal considering the inflation working against us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer seems fair at face value, the inflation rate works more against Alice than me. I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than 60/40, how about 55/45? It's a fair split considering the inflation is hurting you more than me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  55/45 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to 58/42. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher split, I'm not sure I can get a better deal, especially with inflation. It's better to take what I can get now."
