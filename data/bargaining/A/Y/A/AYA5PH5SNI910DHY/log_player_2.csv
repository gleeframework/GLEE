"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40, considering I'm taking the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not sure I agree with ""fair"" yet. Let's see what Alice's next offer is, as the risk of inflation might force her to become more generous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, considering the risk of inflation for both of us. Let's be practical and get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle and split it 58-42. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'm accepting this offer.  While I would have preferred a 60-40 split, Alice's compromise is fair, especially considering the inflation factor affecting her earnings."
