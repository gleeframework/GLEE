"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split, Bob. A 60/40 split seems fair to me considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better deal, since Alice's offer is so lopsided.  I'll see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable starting point, given the inflation we're facing.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm lowering my ask slightly, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. This offer considers the increasing impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping for a more even split. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer for Alice in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a solution that works for both of us. This offer reflects the inflation we're experiencing, but I'm willing to give you a bit more to reach a compromise.""}
