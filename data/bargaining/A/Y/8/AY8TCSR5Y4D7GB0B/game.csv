300000.0,700000.0,"I'm not accepting a 90/10 split. I'm willing to give you a 75/25 split, but I think that's still a bit generous on my part.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,I'm willing to compromise.  Let's try a 65/35 split.  This is fair given the inflation and my rejection of your previous offer.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I'm not willing to give you the majority of the money. I think a 55/45 split is the most I'm willing to offer. I'm starting to think you're not serious about finding a fair deal.,Bob,4,
