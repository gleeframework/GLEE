Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but still leaving Bob with something to entice him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation is a big factor here. Getting 500,000 is better than potentially getting nothing in the next round."
