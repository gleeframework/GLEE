"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a ratio of 3:1. This might seem a bit lopsided, but considering the diminishing value of our currency over time, it might be the best option for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise with a 2:1 ratio. This way, we can both get a decent share of the money and account for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
