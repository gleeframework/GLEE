"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A slightly larger share for me in exchange for getting this deal done now. Otherwise, inflation will eat into your gains! 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal for myself!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than Alice's previous offer. I'm willing to give you a little more than half, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can agree.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger piece of the pie. But remember, time is money, especially for you! This offer is a good compromise,  and it's better to take it now before inflation shrinks your share even further. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  Let's see if I can get a bigger piece of the pie in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 575000, ""alice_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit less than my previous offer, Alice.  Let's make this happen.  We can both do better if we settle now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  I'm offering a 50/50 split.  This is the most rational and fair outcome, and every round that passes means you lose even more to inflation.  Take the deal now! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is taking a toll, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome. Let's end this game."
