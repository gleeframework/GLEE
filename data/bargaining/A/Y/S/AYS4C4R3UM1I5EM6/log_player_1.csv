I'm proposing to keep 90% of the money and give Bob 10%. This is a generous offer considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! While my share is significantly less, his share is worth even less due to the inflation. I'll take my chances and see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the inflation.  I'm proposing to take 81% of the money, leaving Bob with 19%.  This is a fair offer considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Hopefully, Bob will realize this is the best deal he's likely to get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round.  Even though my share is higher, the inflation means that it's worth much less than the initial offer.  I'll try to make a better proposal in the next round, hoping that Bob will finally realize that we both need to be more realistic about this decreasing value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm proposing a 729k/271k split. While the inflation has hit us both hard, I'm trying to be reasonable and offer a significant portion to Bob.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting ridiculous. I'm losing so much value with each round. Even though Bob's offer is terrible, it's still the best I'm likely to get. I need to accept before the money is worth even less.  It's a bad deal, but it's better than nothing."
