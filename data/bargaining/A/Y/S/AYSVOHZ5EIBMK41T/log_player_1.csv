  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than the 50/50 split I proposed initially. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better in the next round!"

Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Bob's offer is still a 55/45 split, but now it's even more skewed in his favor due to the increased inflation. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually worse than my previous offer, so I'll reject it.

However, I still have to consider the fact that the money I gain is decreasing in value with each passing round, so I'll have to be strategic about this. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
