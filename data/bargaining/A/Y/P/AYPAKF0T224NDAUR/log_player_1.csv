"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking its toll, I need to be more careful with my decision. Considering Bob is taking a slightly bigger share, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I need to keep some buffer for future rounds.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and keeping some money for myself, considering the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly bigger share, but I need to keep some buffer for future rounds too. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking its toll, my gain is worth even less now. I need to be cautious and make the most of the situation.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.
