"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better deal. The current offer gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I believe I can propose a more favorable division. Additionally, since the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to try to get a better offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is hitting us both, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us, a 50/50 split at this point seems reasonable. The decreasing value of the money with each passing round makes it less advantageous to continue negotiating for a slightly better deal, as the potential gains are diminished by the inflation. Accepting this offer ensures that I receive a known amount now, rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
