I'm going for a big chunk, hoping Bob will accept the offer in the first round!  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation.  Let's take the 500,000 and call it a day."
