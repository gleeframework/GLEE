Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair.  It acknowledges your initial proposal, but also reflects the fact that I'm taking on the risk of rejection in this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
