**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, while time is working against her much faster than against me. It's risky, but I need to push her further to get a better deal before the money shrinks significantly."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play a strong hand.  Alice is being stubborn and not acknowledging the impact of inflation, which is hurting her more than me.  A 50/50 split is fair and gives her a clear, simple choice. By stating it's my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on her to accept before the deal gets worse for both of us."
