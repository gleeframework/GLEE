I'm going to start by offering Bob $1000 and keeping $9000 for myself. I'll see if he's willing to accept that.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and I'm happy to accept it. We both get an equal share, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
