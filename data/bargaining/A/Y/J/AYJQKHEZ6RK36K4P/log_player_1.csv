"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something fair. This is a good deal before inflation eats away at it! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's split it right down the middle and call it a deal. This is the most logical option with inflation looming. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\nLet's end the game here. With the money being worth 27.1% less for me than in the first round, accepting the 50/50 offer now is more advantageous than risking further rounds where the value of the money could decrease even more significantly. Given the rate of inflation for both of us, this seems like the most logical point to accept and secure the deal before the value of the money drops further."
