"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit lopsided. Let's be more realistic. I propose 70 for me and 30 for you.  The value decreases for both of us each round we waste. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
