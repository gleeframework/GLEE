"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is fair. I was willing to give him $5,000 in the first round, and now he's only offering me $4,000? That's a big drop. I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but still leaving me with a slight majority of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I think I'm still getting shortchanged! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. Bob is still trying to take a larger share of the pie, and I'm not willing to give in. I think I can do better, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money I'll be getting. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle again, but this time I'm willing to give you a bit more""}

I'm trying to find a compromise again, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share this time. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
