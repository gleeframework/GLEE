  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I'll think carefully... Since the money is worth significantly less now, I'll try to get a larger share. However, this offer is slightly more favorable to me than my previous one, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later. I'll accept this offer.
