"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share to start, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 5% less for Bob, I should try to take a larger share to compensate for the devaluation of the money over time.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob such a large share right off the bat. I'll have to consider whether it's worth it to negotiate further.

For now, I'll reject the offer and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up more than 40% of the total. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can get a better deal. I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to be careful not to give up too much. However, I also don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting my next offer.

Since Bob is meeting me halfway between our previous offers, I think this is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer to move forward.
