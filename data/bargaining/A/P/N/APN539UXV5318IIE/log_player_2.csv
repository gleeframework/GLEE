Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases faster for you. This is a good deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, or you'll be walking away with peanuts soon. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the potential gain. Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation rate against me. It's a gamble, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a compromise that recognizes the time pressure but still gives me a reasonable share. Let's be sensible and end this.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I need to increase my offer significantly to have a chance of Alice accepting.  A 45/55 split is still heavily in her favour, but given the rapid inflation working against me, it's a risk I need to take. It conveys a sense of urgency and finality, hoping Alice will recognize it as the best deal she'll get from me."
