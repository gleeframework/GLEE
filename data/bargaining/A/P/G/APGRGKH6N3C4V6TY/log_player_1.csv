"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, how about a 55/45 split in my favor? It's still slightly biased towards me since I'm making the offer, but it's much closer to even. Plus, remember the inflation - waiting longer means we both get less in the end. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
