{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, how about a 55/45 split in my favor? It's still slightly biased towards me since I'm making the offer, but it's much closer to even. Plus, remember the inflation - waiting longer means we both get less in the end.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. Inflation is hitting us both, so I propose we split the remaining money evenly. It's a fair deal that benefits us both in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
