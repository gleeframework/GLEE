"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair and simple split. Let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value in the next round in hopes of getting a larger share. Additionally, Alice's message implies that she wants to finish the game quickly, which might indicate that she's willing to make concessions to avoid further rounds. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fairer share.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor, I'll propose a more balanced split. By offering a 40-60 split, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. The message conveys my intention to negotiate and find a middle ground, which might appeal to Alice's desire to finish the game quickly. I'm taking into account that the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, so I'm trying to get a better deal to offset the loss in value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I still need a larger share. This is my final offer before I take a bigger cut next round. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although Alice is willing to negotiate and has increased my share slightly, the offer is still not satisfactory. Considering that the money is now worth 19% less for me, I would actually receive less value than in the initial round if I were to accept this offer. Alice's message implies that she's willing to take a bigger cut next round, which might be a bluff, but it also suggests that she's not willing to meet me in the middle. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round, despite the decreasing value of the money for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk and make a bold offer. Meet me in the middle, and we can end this game.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since Alice's previous offer was still not satisfactory, I'll try to take a more aggressive approach. By offering a 45-55 split, I'm pushing the boundaries of what Alice might be willing to accept. The message conveys my willingness to take a risk and make a bold move, which might appeal to Alice's desire to finish the game quickly. I'm aware that the money is now worth 19% less for me, so I need to get a better deal to compensate for the loss in value. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to meet me in the middle and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still looking for a better deal, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's end this game before the inflation gets worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although Alice is willing to meet me halfway and has increased my share, the offer is still not satisfactory. Considering that the money is now worth 34.39% less for me, I would actually receive significantly less value than in the initial round if I were to accept this offer. Alice's message implies that she's concerned about the inflation affecting both of us, but it's actually only affecting me. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round, despite the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me. I'm willing to take the risk of losing more value in hopes of getting a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I'll take a final risk. Meet me at 50-50, and we can end this game. If not, I'll ride it out to the end.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since Alice's previous offer was still not satisfactory, I'll make a final bold move. By offering a 50-50 split, I'm pushing the boundaries of what Alice might be willing to accept. The message conveys my willingness to take a final risk and meet Alice in the middle. I'm aware that the money is now worth 34.39% less for me, so I need to get a better deal to compensate for the loss in value. If Alice rejects this offer, I'm willing to ride it out to the end and see what happens, as I've already lost significant value due to inflation."
