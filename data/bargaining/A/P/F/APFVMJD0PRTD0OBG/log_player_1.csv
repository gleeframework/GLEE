"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the $100 with a 55/45 ratio, giving me a slight advantage to account for the potential inflation. This seems like a fair compromise considering we both have a chance to make the next proposal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
