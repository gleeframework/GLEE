"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I'm looking for more. Will you give me a better deal now? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to take advantage of the initial offer!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a better deal than the one I initially proposed. The inflation is already taking a toll on the value of the money, and I'd like to see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll have to adjust my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal to account for the inflation. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000, which is a bit more than his initial offer, but still a fair split considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still looking for a better deal. You're getting a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise. Will you meet me here? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to negotiate!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $300,000. With the inflation, that's only 30% of the original amount, and I'm not sure if Bob is taking the inflation into account. I'd like to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a significant toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a better deal to account for the inflation. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $550,000, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but I'm still not getting the better deal I think I deserve."
