"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a majority, but I'm open to negotiation.  It's important to remember the money is going to lose value in each round.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less in each round, I'll try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite one-sided, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share. Let's try to find a middle ground!""}

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still leaving me with a decent amount."
