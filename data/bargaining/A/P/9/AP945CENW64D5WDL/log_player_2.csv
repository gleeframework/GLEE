"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept a 50/50 split. There's a lot of rounds left, and the value of the money is going to decrease for Bob.  Let's see if Alice will offer more later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""I'm taking a majority, but I'm open to negotiation.  It's important to remember the money is going to lose value in each round.  Let's make a deal!"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share. Let's try to find a middle ground! 
# Bob gain: 700000 
# Alice gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would love to keep more, the value of the money is decreasing with each round. 700,000 is a good amount, and it's unlikely Alice will offer more."
