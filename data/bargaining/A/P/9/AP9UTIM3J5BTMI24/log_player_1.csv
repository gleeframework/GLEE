"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is making the numbers get interesting!

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation taking its toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm taking a bit more for myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal!

However, I notice that his offer is the same as the one he made in Round 2, which I rejected. I'm not sure if he's trying to trick me or if he's just not paying attention.

In any case, I'm not going to fall for it. I'll reject this offer as well.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The game is heating up!

Considering the inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm taking a bigger share for myself, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
