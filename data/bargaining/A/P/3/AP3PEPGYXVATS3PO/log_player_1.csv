{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering the inflation we'll both face in subsequent rounds.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 65/35 split, considering the inflation will hit me harder in the next round if we don't reach an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
