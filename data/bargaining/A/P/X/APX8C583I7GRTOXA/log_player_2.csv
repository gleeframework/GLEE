"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to offer a slightly better deal for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a 30/70 split.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll think about the value of the money in terms of its original value. In the first round, $100 was worth $100, but now it's worth 90.25% of that, or $90.25. So, Alice's offer is equivalent to:

$35 / 0.9025 = $38.82 in original value

I'll try to do better than that. I'll offer a slightly higher amount.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the original $100. Since the money is worth 90.25% of its original value, I'll aim for a 40/60 split, which is equivalent to:

$40 / 0.9025 = $44.36 in original value
