Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it down the middle this time. Inflation is hurting us both, and we don't want to keep going back and forth.  We can both agree this is the fairest way to divide the money now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
