"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. Your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a more balanced 60/40 split. This ensures a fair outcome for both of us. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
