"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from the deal while considering the devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than Alice's offer. This proposal keeps more for me, but still gives you a significant share. Let's end this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer ensures a clean 50/50 split before the inflation hurts us both further.  It's time to settle. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd like to get more, the risk of further inflation makes this a reasonable deal.  Let's end it here."
