"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Trying to get a better deal, but still being fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as concerned about the absolute numbers as I was in the first round. However, I still think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Trying to find a middle ground, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer, but still a compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in meeting in the middle and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm also not eager to risk going to another round. I think I can live with this offer, especially since Bob is getting closer to meeting me in the middle.

I'll accept this offer.
