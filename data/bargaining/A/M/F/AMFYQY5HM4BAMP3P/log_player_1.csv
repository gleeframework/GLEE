"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000 and leave 40% for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob thinks a 60/40 split is fairer now that he's the one making the offer!

However, I'm not convinced. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd like to adjust the offer to account for this. I'll counter with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to adjust for inflation, how about 420000 for me and 580000 for you?""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value after two rounds of inflation (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64), I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 384000,
  ""bob_gain"": 616000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the remaining value fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share to account for the reduced value of the money, and hoping he'll accept this offer."
