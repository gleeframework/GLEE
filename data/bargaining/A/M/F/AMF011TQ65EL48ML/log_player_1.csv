"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. While this might seem unfair, it's a good starting point considering the inflation risk.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing later due to inflation. Bob's offer is fair, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal in future rounds."
