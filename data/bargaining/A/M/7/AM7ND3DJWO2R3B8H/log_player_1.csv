"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I take 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob takes 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60%, you get 40% 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that I can do better in future rounds.
