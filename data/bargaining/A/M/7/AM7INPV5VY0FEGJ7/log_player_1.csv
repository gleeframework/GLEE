I'm starting with a very unequal offer, but I want to see how Bob reacts to the prospect of getting less than 10% of the money. It's also a good starting point for negotiation.  Let's see if he accepts or counter-offers!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a risky move, but I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm not going to let him dictate the terms, and I believe I can get a better deal if I keep playing.  He's already shown he's willing to be aggressive, so I need to be prepared for anything in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to compromise a bit this round, offering Bob 40%.  Since I rejected his offer, he's more likely to be receptive to a more balanced proposal. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to give ground to avoid running out of time."
