Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very simple offer, giving myself the lion's share.  I want to see how Bob responds and gauge his risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, this offer is a significant improvement from the first round.  Considering the inflation factor, accepting a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure I get something, rather than risking getting nothing at all if we continue to disagree."
