"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 700,000 is now worth 56% of the original $1,000,000 (since 700,000 * 0.8^1 = 560,000, and 560,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.56).

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, my offer will be worth 44% of the original $1,000,000 (since 700,000 * 0.8^2 = 448,000, and 448,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.448).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my potential gain in this offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and I initially had 80% of the original $1,000,000, my gain in this round is worth 80% * (1 - 0.488) = 41.44% of the original $1,000,000.

In this offer, I would get 550,000, which is worth 41.44% of the original $1,000,000. This is a good deal for me, as it's more than my initial 40.96% (80% * 0.8^3).
