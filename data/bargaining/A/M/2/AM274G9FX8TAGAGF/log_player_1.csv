"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, Alice. I need a bit more than that to make it worthwhile. This offer is still generous considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is slightly better than what I offered him, but the inflation is working against me. Let's see...

**Let's analyze:**

* **Bob's Offer:** I get $5200, he gets $4800.
* **If I Reject:**  The pot will shrink to $9500 ($9000 for me, $9500 for Bob due to inflation). I'll have to offer Bob a really good deal to get him to agree, likely cutting into my potential gains even more.

**Decision:**

While I'm not thrilled,  Bob is unlikely to accept anything less favorable in the next round.
