"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to take most of the money since I'm making the first offer, but I'm willing to share a bit to avoid a long game.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair to split it 50/50, considering we're both making proposals. Let's end this game here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more money, the inflation means that taking a 50/50 split is the better deal in the long run.  It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
