I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm willing to compromise a little.  I'll take 55 and offer Bob 45. This reflects the fact that the value of the money is decreasing with each round."
