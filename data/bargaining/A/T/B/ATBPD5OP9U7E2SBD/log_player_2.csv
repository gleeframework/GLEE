"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split close to 50/50, but with a slight advantage to me for being the first proposer. This ensures we both benefit from settling now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand your desire for a slight advantage, but since the money is worth less with every round, I think a closer to 50/50 split with a slight advantage for me this time is more fair.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a somewhat even split. Let's compromise - this offer is closer to the middle ground between our previous proposals.  Each round that passes hurts you more than me, so taking this deal now is in your best interest. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
