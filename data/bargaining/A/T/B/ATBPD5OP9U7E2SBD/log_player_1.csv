Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire for a slight advantage, but since the money is worth less with every round, I think a closer to 50/50 split with a slight advantage for me this time is more fair. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
