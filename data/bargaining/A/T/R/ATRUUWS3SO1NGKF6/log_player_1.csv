"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large chunk of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with a small portion.  I'm hoping he'll accept, as even a small amount is better than nothing in the first round. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!  I'm not going to accept his offer, even though I lose 20% of my share in the next round. I'll make a better counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still keeping a significant portion for myself. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm hoping this offer is tempting enough to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really hitting hard now.  Even though I'm getting a lot less than I originally wanted, I'm better off accepting this offer than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
