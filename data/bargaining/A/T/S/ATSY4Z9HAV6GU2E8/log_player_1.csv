"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 40% and keeping 60% for myself. It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping you'll accept it to end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 5% less gain is 570,000. Since Bob's offer is 500,000, it's a slightly better deal for me than my original offer. I'll accept this offer.
