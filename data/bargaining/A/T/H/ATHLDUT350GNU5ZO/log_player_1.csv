"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $4,000 and I'll take $6,000, with the message ""Let's split fairly, I'll take 60%"".

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm offering you 40% this time, and I'll take 60%. It's a fair deal, and it avoids any more rounds of decreasing value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will not accept Bob's offer of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for him. The money is already worth 20% less for me, so I would actually get less value than in the first round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI will send my offer as previously decided.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll take 58% this time, it's the minimum I can accept considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If Bob rejects, I'll wait for his counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nKeep in mind that the money is worth 20% less for me than in the first round, so I'll have to take that into account when making future decisions.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed with the game!"
