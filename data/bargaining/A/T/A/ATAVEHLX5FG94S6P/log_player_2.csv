Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is fair, given the inflation we're both facing. It's better than risking getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
