I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm willing to concede a bit to reach an agreement. This offer still favors me slightly, but takes into account the inflation affecting both of us."
