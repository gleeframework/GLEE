I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor.  I figure Bob will be more likely to accept this than a 50/50 split, and it's only a dollar difference to him.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
