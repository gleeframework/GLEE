"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original amount, which is $200,000. I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, and now it's 20% less again, that means the money is now worth 80% of the original value.

With that in mind, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer:

Alice gain: 100,000 (original value) = 80,000 (current value)
Bob gain: 900,000 (original value) = 720,000 (current value)

I'll reject this offer. I want a better deal! 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 80% of the original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000
}
```

I'll take 64% of the current value, which is $640,000, and leave Bob with 36% of the current value, which is $360,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less after three rounds of inflation, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer:

Alice gain: 300,000 (original value) = 300,000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 154,800 (current value)
Bob gain: 700,000 (original value) = 700,000 * 0.516 = 360,120 (current value)

I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing, and I'll get a decent amount of money.
