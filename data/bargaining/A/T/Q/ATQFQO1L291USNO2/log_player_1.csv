"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I propose a split where I get 99% and Bob gets 1%.  I think this is a fair offer, as I'm the one proposing.  Let's see how he feels about it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take half now than risk getting less in the next round."
