"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think 60 for me and 40 for you is a good start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we should split it more evenly, 55 for me and 45 for you is more fair considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\nLet me know what Alice decides."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly this time.  Inflation is hurting us both, so 50/50 seems the fairest solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll take the 50/50 split. With inflation, it's better to get something now rather than risk further devaluation."
