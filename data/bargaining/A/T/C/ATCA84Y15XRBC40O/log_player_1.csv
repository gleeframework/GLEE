"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate and consider other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  Let's try a 55/45 split.  I'm open to negotiating further if you have another idea. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'd rather not settle for a smaller share. I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risk of rejection. Let's try this and see if we can finalize the deal.""
}
```"
