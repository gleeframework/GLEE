"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'll consider his offer and decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think it's still biased towards Bob, and I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a more equal split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to increase my chances of getting a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not willing to go below 55/45. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly more favorable split, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to give up more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle and avoid further negotiations.

I'll consider his offer and decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise, and I'm not willing to push for more given that Bob has already met me in the middle."
