"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60% of the initial $100 and Bob takes 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this case, I'll consider the offer as if it's a 50-50 split of the reduced value, which is $80 (100 - 20% = 80).

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
