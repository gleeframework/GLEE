"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise at 50-50, it's a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I need to be careful.

In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so $5,000 is worth $4,500. For Bob, the money is worth 20% less, so $5,000 is worth $4,000.

I think 50-50 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept this offer.
