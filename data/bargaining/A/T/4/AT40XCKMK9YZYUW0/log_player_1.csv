Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'm willing to take a large share, but I'm also factoring in the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy. With inflation, my gain is only worth 80% of what it was in the previous round. Taking 500,000 now is better than risking further rounds and potentially getting less."
