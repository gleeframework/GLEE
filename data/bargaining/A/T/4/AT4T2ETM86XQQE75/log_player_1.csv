Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to decide whether it's better to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

For now, I'll decide to reject the offer.
