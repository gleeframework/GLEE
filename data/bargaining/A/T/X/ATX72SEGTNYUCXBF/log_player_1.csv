"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can both be happy with this.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leaving Bob with 30 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 90% of the original amount, so I'm actually gaining 63 dollars (70 * 0.9).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm gaining 50 dollars, which is worth the same as in the first round. This is a better offer for me than the original one, and meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
