"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to try to get a good deal for myself, but I'm also mindful that Bob might reject this and we'll both have to deal with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, it's still better to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, and I'm not going to let him get away with it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to try to increase my share from the previous round, but I'm still trying to be reasonable. Bob might accept this offer, especially if he's worried about inflation too."
