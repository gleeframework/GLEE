"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a slight advantage, while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is worse for me than my initial offer, it's still better than the current value of my initial offer after inflation. I want to see if I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Since Bob rejected my initial offer and inflation is hitting him harder, I propose an even split.  This is the fairest option considering the current value of the money after inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is not fair.  I am still better off holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm taking a calculated risk here. Inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me, so I'm offering him a slightly better deal than the previous round, hoping he'll accept it. I'm still getting a good amount, and it's better than the current value of my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse for me, even with inflation.  I'm willing to take the risk of another round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower amount for myself, but inflation is heavily impacting Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, as it's still a significant gain for him. This is a calculated risk, but I believe it's the best move in this situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, even with inflation.  I'm willing to take the risk of another round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}
```

Inflation is hitting Bob hard now, so I'm offering a slightly lower amount for myself, but it's still a good deal for both of us.  The current value of this offer is better for me than Bob's last offer, and he should see the advantage of accepting it."
