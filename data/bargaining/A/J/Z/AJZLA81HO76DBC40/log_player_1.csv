Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\nI hope this is what you were looking for. Let me know if I made a mistake."

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI rejected the offer since I can try to get a better deal in the next round, taking into account the inflation that affects my gain but not Bob's."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
