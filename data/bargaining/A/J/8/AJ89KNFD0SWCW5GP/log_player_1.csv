"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  Let's wrap this up - a slight edge to me seems fair since you lose value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I lose value in future rounds due to inflation, I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for me. In the next round, the money will be worth even less, so I should try to maximize my gain in this round or the next. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than $4,500, so I will reject his proposal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round! I'll try to make a more favorable offer or get a better deal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me, considering the inflation. Since I rejected Bob's offer of $4,500, I'll offer him a bit less and take a bit more, while still being reasonable. I'll also remind him that the money is losing value for me, so it's in both our interests to conclude the deal soon.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can wrap this up before the money loses more value for me.""}\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer, it's practically even.  Any more rounds and the money will be worth significantly less for you. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, Bob's offer of $4,900 is starting to look more reasonable, especially since the money will lose even more value in future rounds. At this point, it's better for me to accept this offer and secure the $4,900 rather than risking further devaluation. Let's conclude the deal!"
