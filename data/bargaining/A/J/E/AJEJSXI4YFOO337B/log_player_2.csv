Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have accepted earlier 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is not great, at this point, Bob is losing a lot of money due to inflation. Accepting is the best option to get something rather than risk getting nothing."
