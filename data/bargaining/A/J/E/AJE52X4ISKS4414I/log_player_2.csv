"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob, but I get a little extra for going first. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's split it a bit more evenly this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's stop wasting time. We'll both lose out to inflation if this drags on. 50/50 is the fairest and fastest solution. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. 50/50 is a fair split, and with the inflation, it's the best we can do."
