"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth $3600 (10% less than $4000).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob's proposal, as it seems a bit one-sided. I'd rather not give him a 60/40 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so my gain is now worth $3240 (10% less than $3600).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going all the way to 60/40.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up more than I have to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with these small increments. I think I deserve a bigger share. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $3000 is now worth $2187.30 (27.1% less than $3000).

I'm not thrilled with Bob's latest proposal. I think it's still a bit one-sided, and I'm not willing to give him such a large share.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the previous round, so my gain is now worth $2187.30 (10% less than $2430, which is 10% less than $3000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a fair compromise. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up more than I have to."
