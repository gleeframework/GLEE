"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle quickly due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the inflation rates, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think this is a more balanced offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal than the initial offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for me with this inflation rate. This offer is a compromise, but I need you to meet me closer to my initial proposal. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. The inflation is indeed affecting both of us, but I believe I can still push for a better deal considering Alice's higher inflation rate. Let's make another counteroffer!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5700, ""alice_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""I understand the pressure of inflation, but I'm also losing value each round. This is a slightly more generous offer than my last, considering the mutual loss of value. Let's find a middle ground.""}"
