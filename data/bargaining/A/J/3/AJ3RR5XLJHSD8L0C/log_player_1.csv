Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor, 55% for me, 45% for you.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept to avoid further inflation, but Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation, 58% for me, 42% for you. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to try and squeeze more out of the deal. While the difference is smaller, it's still important to aim for a fairer split.  I'll hold out for a better offer in the next round."
