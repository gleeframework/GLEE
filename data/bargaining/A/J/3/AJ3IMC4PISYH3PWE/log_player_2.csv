"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a little early to accept such a lopsided offer. There are still 11 rounds left, and with inflation in play, holding out for a better deal might be worth it."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's a fair start, and we can both benefit from the inflation effect.""}
