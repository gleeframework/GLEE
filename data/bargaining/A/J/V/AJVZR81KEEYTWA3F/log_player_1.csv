"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split wasn't in our best interest long term.  I'm offering you 4000, take it or leave it,  knowing the value decreases rapidly for you in further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the value of the money decreases rapidly for me in further rounds, I want to try to get a better offer or make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. 52.5-47.5 split is the best I can offer.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me and trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, while still being favorable to me. I've reduced my initial offer to try to reach an agreement before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value will only continue to plummet, primarily for you. I'm offering a 55/45 split as a final offer.  This is your last chance for a reasonable amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in the value of the money for me, and Bob's offer being relatively close to my initial proposal, I think it's best to accept this offer. The risk of further rounds would lead to an even greater loss in value for me, making this offer the most reasonable choice at this point."
