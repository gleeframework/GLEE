"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than the initial $10,000, the total amount now is $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8).

I'll make a proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... I think there's been a mistake! The money is worth 20% less than the initial $10,000, so it's $8,000. Then, in round 2, it's worth 80% of $8,000, which is $6,400. And now, in round 3, it's worth 80% of $6,400, which is $5,120.

But let's look at Alice's offer: she's offering me $4,000, which is 78.13% of the current value. That's a good deal!
