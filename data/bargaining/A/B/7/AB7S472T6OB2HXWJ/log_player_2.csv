Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While far from ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation's Bite:**  The value of Bob's potential gains is eroding rapidly with each round.  Waiting any longer will likely result in even worse offers.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice knows Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and is clearly holding out for a larger share. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Taking $250,000, though severely reduced by inflation, is still better than holding out, potentially receiving an even worse offer, and risking getting nothing at all."
