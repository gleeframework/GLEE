"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take a slightly larger share, as the money is worth less to you in the next round. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with Bob taking a 2:1 ratio. I think it's too unfair, especially since the money is worth less to me due to inflation. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the changing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but not too much. Let's try again!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more skewed split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
