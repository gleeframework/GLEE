"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's finish the game quickly""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount now, but I'll get more later. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $2000 is now worth 90% of $2000, which is $1800, and Bob's gain of $8000 is now worth 80% of $8000, which is $6400.

I'll reject this offer because I'm not getting a fair deal, and I'm not convinced that Bob's promise of getting more later will materialize. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 90% of what it was in the previous round. My goal is to get as much as possible while keeping the option open for future rounds.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a larger share, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can do""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, hoping to make the game more attractive to him, while still keeping a significant amount for myself."
