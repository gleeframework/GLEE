Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous Alice, but let's make it snappy. Time is money, after all.

# Bob gain: 650000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split the difference from my last offer. We both win and stop wasting time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is playing a waiting game, counting on my fear of inflation to force me into accepting a bad deal. While the 48.8% inflation hurts, accepting a deal where I get less than 50% is worse in the long run. I need to show firmness to push him towards a more equitable split in the upcoming rounds."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is as close to even as it's going to get.  Let's be done with this! 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The relentless inflation is crushing my potential gains. While not ideal, Bob's offer is now barely above the 50/50 split after factoring in the 67.23% inflation I've taken.  

* Accepting nets me a little less than half, but rejecting means the value will likely dip below 50% even if Bob offers a slightly better deal in the next round.
* There's also a risk Bob won't budge further, leaving me with a much worse deal in later rounds or even nothing if we don't agree before the end.

It's a tough decision, but the risk of losing more ground outweighs the hope of a slightly better deal at this point."
