Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I propose I take $60, and you take $40. It's a fair starting point.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that.  Let's split it more evenly - I'll take 55 and you take 45.  This way we both get a good share and we can move on.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and our money is losing value. I'm proposing $58 for me and $42 for you. It's a slight adjustment from my first offer, and I think it's reasonable considering the time constraint. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
