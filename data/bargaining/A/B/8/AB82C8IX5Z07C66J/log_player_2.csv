Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know the value is decreasing for you, but I'm not budging much. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse outcome. Accepting this offer cuts my losses and avoids a potentially much smaller gain in future rounds.
