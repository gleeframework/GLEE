"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original $100, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'll try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. However, I don't want to give Bob too much, so I'll stick with my previous offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth even less now. I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a slightly biased split in my favor, considering the decreasing value of money."
