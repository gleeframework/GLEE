400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I think we can both do better than your last offer.  I propose we split it 60/40, with me taking 600,000. This is a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money with each round.",Bob,2,

520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. This is already the third round, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm proposing I take $520,000 and you take $480,000. It's a better deal for you than waiting for another round, and it's still fair considering my initial offer.",Alice,3,
