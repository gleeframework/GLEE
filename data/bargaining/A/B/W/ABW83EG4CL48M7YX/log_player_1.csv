"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can both do better than your last offer.  I propose we split it 60/40, with me taking 600,000. This is a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
