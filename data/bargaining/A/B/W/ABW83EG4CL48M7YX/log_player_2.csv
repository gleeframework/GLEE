Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is already the third round, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm proposing I take $520,000 and you take $480,000. It's a better deal for you than waiting for another round, and it's still fair considering my initial offer. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
