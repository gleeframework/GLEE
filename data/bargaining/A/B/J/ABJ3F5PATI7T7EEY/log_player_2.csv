"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost equally, Bob. I get slightly more since I proposed first. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll take a shot at getting more!  Let's see what Alice counters with."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think it's time for a more even split.  Let's both get a good share of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not be greedy. It's clear we both want a good deal. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is a fair deal, and the inflation is starting to make a real impact. Let's not risk losing more."
