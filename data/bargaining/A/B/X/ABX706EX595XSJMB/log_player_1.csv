Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. This is a much fairer split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This offer benefits us both. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean getting less than half the total amount, and significantly less than what I originally proposed.  I need to hold out for a better deal, but I need to be mindful that my offers will become less appealing to Bob as time passes and inflation eats into my potential gains."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time constraint. Let's be practical and end this now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Don't let greed make us both losers. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is rapidly eroding my potential gains. While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal at the start, it's the most reasonable offer I'm likely to get at this point. Accepting ensures I get something rather than nothing if we run out of time."
