Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, the money is losing value for you... 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's not ideal, but with the inflation rate, accepting is the better option. I'll lose a significant amount of value if I continue to reject."
