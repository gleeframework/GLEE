"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This means I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of 4000 is now worth 80% of 4000, which is 3200. That's not bad, but I'm hoping for more.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This time, I'm offering a higher share to Bob, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal for myself."
