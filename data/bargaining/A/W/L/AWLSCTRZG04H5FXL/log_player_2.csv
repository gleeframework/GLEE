Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe this offer is fairer considering our respective inflation rates.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of my higher inflation rate. While her offer is better than her first, accepting now would still give her a much larger share after accounting for the decreased value of the money.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both facing inflation, but I believe this offer is a good starting point for a compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is essentially mirroring my previous offer, but with the inflation working against me, this deal becomes increasingly unfavorable. While time is running out, I need to show firmness and aim for a more balanced outcome in the next round.  Accepting now would be letting her take advantage of the situation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with each passing round, the value of the money diminishes for both of us.  Let's split the remaining money evenly and end this game. It's the most reasonable solution considering the current circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer of a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this juncture.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing drastically increases.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer this drags on, the less the money will be worth for both of us, but especially for me due to the higher inflation rate.
* **Fairness in Context:**  Given the time pressure and the rapid devaluation, a 50/50 split, even with the inflation disparity, represents a fair outcome at this stage.

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than to gamble on getting a slightly better deal later and risk losing everything."
