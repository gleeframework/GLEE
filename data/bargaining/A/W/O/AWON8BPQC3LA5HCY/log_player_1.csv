"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 700k. It's a fair split, considering the value of money decreases by 10% for me each round. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, my gain of $700,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $665,000, and Bob's gain of $300,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $270,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
