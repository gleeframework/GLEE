Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."

# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejection. Let's move forward with this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer yet. I think I can do better than a 40-60 split.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a better split for me. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more""}

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I still think a 55-45 split is more fair.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before the money loses even more value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'm getting a bit desperate with the inflation and the limited time we have left. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can do better in the next round.
