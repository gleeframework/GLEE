""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is a better deal for you than my previous offer. Let's settle this! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the offer, it's a better deal for me than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
