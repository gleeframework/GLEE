Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is running out and the value is decreasing rapidly for both of us. This offer still gives you a considerable sum. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is only slightly better than her last one, and still heavily favors Alice.  I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal, especially since the inflation is hitting me harder."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This offer is a good compromise, especially considering the decreasing value. Let's close this out and both walk away with a good sum.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The pot is shrinking fast.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is getting more aggressive and her ""final offer"" statement holds weight given the shrinking pot. While not ideal, accepting avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
