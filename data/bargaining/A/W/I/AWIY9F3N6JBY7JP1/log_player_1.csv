Let's see if Bob takes this deal!  I'm offering to keep the majority, but I'm also giving Bob a small amount to ensure he doesn't completely reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take $1000, I know that the money will be worth less and less to Bob with each passing round. I'm going to bet on my own negotiating skills and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to decrease my offer slightly, but I'm still keeping a large share.  Hopefully, this is enough to entice Bob to accept before his offer gets even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Bob is getting a much better deal than me. I believe I can still get a more equitable split, especially as his offer will be worth less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to slightly decrease my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority share.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds, but I'm confident I can still get a good deal.  Let's see what Bob decides!"
