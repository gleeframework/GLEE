"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more for my part in this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially considering the money I gain is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has already taken a toll on the value of the money I gain, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the reduced value of the money I gain due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation and my previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a significant toll on the value of the money I gain. Considering the reduced value of the money I'll receive, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

However, I still feel that a 35/65 split is not favorable to me, especially considering the value of the money I gain is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a hit on the value of the money I gain. I'll need to be more aggressive with my offer to compensate for the reduced value. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 38,
  ""bob_gain"": 62,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight majority, but I need a better deal to make up for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 38/62 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the reduced value of the money I gain due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation and my previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money I gain. With the money I gain being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate to get a better deal.

However, I still feel that a 30/70 split is not acceptable, especially considering the significant reduction in the value of the money I gain. I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm willing to take a risk and hope that Bob will make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really hurting the value of the money I gain. I'll have to be extremely aggressive with my offer to make up for it. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a majority, but I need a better deal to make up for the extreme inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 32/68 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the reduced value of the money I gain due to inflation. I'm taking a risk, but I hope Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise."
