"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either. This is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 70-30 split, especially since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 80-20 is a fairer split. You can't get a better deal than this!""}

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me $80 and Bob $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think 25 is the minimum I can accept. You're not getting 80%! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even smaller share. 75-25 is a decent compromise, and I think I can live with it. I'll take the deal."
