Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiations.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple proposal, hoping Bob will accept it."

# Bob gain: 70

  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time.""
