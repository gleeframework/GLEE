Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is becoming a game of chicken, and neither of us can afford to wait much longer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need you to be realistic about the impact of inflation. This offer is fair and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
