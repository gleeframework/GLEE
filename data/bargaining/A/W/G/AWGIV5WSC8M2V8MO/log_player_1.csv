Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but your initial offer was too low. This offer is much fairer considering the money will be worth less for both of us if we wait any longer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
