Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything. Since you're Bob, you can't lose any value, so I'm hoping you'll accept this to avoid any chance of getting nothing in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round. Even though the value is decreasing, it's still a decent amount!"
