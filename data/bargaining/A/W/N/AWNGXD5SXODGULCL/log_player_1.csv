"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, giving me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid a long and potentially contentious negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite lopsided, giving him 70% of the remaining $900,000. I'll have to think carefully before accepting.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was quite one-sided, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the remaining $900,000, which is a slightly more modest increase from my initial offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another lopsided offer from Bob! The money is worth less and less with each passing round, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. But I still want to hold out for a fair deal.

I'll reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With each passing round, the money is worth less and less, and I need to be more aggressive in my offers to get a fair share. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm going for a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer given the decreasing value of the money. Let's see if Bob will finally accept!"
