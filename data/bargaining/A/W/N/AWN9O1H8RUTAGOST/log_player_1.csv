# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting worse for him with each round due to inflation. While his offer isn't great for me, it's highly likely he'll be forced to offer even more in the next round to get a deal done."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate, and his offers are reflecting that.  He's trying to frame a worse offer as a concession, but it's clear the inflation is hurting him more than me.  I'll hold out for a much better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and this is a fair deal given the situation. Take it before it's too late!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm applying a bit more pressure now. Bob's offers are getting wild, and he needs to understand that the longer this goes on, the worse it is for him. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to be slightly more flexible to try and close the deal."

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is panicking. He's willing to give me a pittance to try and secure something for himself.  This means I have him right where I want him.  The longer we wait, the more desperate he'll become, and the better my position gets."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a lifeline here. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking!"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm going back to my original offer. Bob needs a reality check.  He's clearly not thinking straight, and I need to assert my position. This offer is generous considering the circumstances, and it sends a strong message that I'm not going to be lowballed.  He can either take the deal now or risk ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm going for broke here. This is my final offer. I'm desperate for a decent share, and I'm hoping you'll take it to avoid both of us getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is it. Bob is completely desperate. His offer is insulting, and accepting it would mean letting him walk away with almost everything despite the inflation working heavily against him. I'm betting he'll crack under pressure and give me a much better offer in the next round.  It's risky, but I'm this far in; I have to see it through."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 9000,
""bob_gain"": 1000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's over.  Take this offer, or you get nothing. It's your last chance.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to end this. Bob is delusional if he thinks he's getting anything more than a pittance. This offer is a gift at this point, and it highlights how badly he's misjudged the situation. He'll likely take it out of sheer desperation, giving me a significant victory."
