"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not accepting that offer. One dollar is not worth the risk of getting nothing in the next round. Let's see what Alice proposes."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair deal. You get a small share, but I get the majority, and we both get something. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair this time, Bob. We both get a good share, and we can finally end this game. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's do it! 500,000 is a good amount considering the inflation, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
