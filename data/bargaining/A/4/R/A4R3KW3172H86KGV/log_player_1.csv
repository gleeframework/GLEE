"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going for a strong starting offer, aiming for 90% of the money. It's a bit aggressive, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a quick deal.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still asking for a substantial amount, but at least he's moved closer to my position. I'm not going to accept this offer yet, but I'm getting a sense of his strategy. I'll see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to 85, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. This is a compromise considering the inflation factor and Bob's previous offer. It's a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping it will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly stubborn. He's still trying to claim a significant portion of the money.  While the inflation is starting to impact my gains, I'm not ready to give in yet. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, dropping back down to 80 to see if I can tempt Bob into a deal. I'm getting a better sense of his negotiating style, and I think he's becoming more susceptible to compromise as the rounds pass."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting bolder, and the inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm not going to cave in just yet. I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm dropping my offer to 75, acknowledging the significant impact of inflation.  This is my last chance to get a decent deal before the money's worth becomes even less.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of a deal at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. While inflation is taking a heavy toll on the value of my share, Bob is offering an equal split. Given the risk of getting nothing at all, I'm accepting his offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than losing everything."
