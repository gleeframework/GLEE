"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm leaving room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $500,000
Bob gain: $500,000

I'm not thrilled about splitting it down the middle, but it's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
