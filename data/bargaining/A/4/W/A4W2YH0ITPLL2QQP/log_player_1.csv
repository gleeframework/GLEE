"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47.5 
# Bob gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice gain: 47.5 * 0.9 = 42.75
Bob gain: 52.5

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, as I was initially hoping to get more than 42.75. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
