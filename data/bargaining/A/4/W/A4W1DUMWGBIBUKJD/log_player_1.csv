"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $700,000 is now worth only $560,000. Bob's offer of $500,000 is a significant reduction from his initial proposal, but it's still a 50-50 split. I'll think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, so my share of $700,000 is now worth only $420,000. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
