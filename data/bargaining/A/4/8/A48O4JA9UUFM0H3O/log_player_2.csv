Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 437500 
# Alice gain: 562500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, but Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  While her offer is closer to the middle, accepting now sets a bad precedent for future rounds. It's getting riskier, but I need to hold firm for a bit longer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be real. I'm taking a hit from inflation, you know it. 50/50 is the only fair deal left. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is getting increasingly problematic. While ideally, I'd secure a slight advantage, a 50/50 split is the cleanest and fairest option at this point. It avoids further losses from inflation and sends a strong message that I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal."
