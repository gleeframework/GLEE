"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. If Bob accepts, we can end the game and both get our respective amounts. If he declines, I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want to negotiate further! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll adjust my calculations accordingly.

In this round, I would gain $50, but due to inflation, it's worth 90% of the original value, so it's equivalent to $45.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, as I was hoping to get more. However, it's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.
