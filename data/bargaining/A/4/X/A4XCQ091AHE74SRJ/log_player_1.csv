Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

This is a tough one! While ideally, I want more, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We are in round 8, with only 4 rounds left.  The pressure is on, and Bob is digging in.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While my money stays constant, his value decreases.  He's more likely to accept a less favorable deal now than later.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject this, there's a good chance I'll end up with nothing if we can't reach an agreement. 500,000 is better than 0."
