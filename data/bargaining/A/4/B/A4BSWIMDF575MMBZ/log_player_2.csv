"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! I'll give you a small amount to get us started. Accept and we can call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 9000,
""alice_gain"": 1000,
""message"": ""I'll give you a chance to get a little more this time, but it's still my money!  Accept, or risk getting nothing at all.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split the difference and call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the $4000. It's a decent amount and I'm not sure how much longer this game will go on."
