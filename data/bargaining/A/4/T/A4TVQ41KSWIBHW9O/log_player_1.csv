"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority share, recognizing that she has the first move advantage. It's a reasonable starting point, and it will be interesting to see if Bob will accept or try to negotiate a better deal for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial offer. While I understand that inflation is working against me, I am willing to hold out for a better deal.  I believe I can still secure a larger share, especially since Bob's gains are now being devalued by inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer a compromise.  I'm still aiming for a majority, but I'm acknowledging the inflation is hurting Bob more than me. This offer splits the difference between our previous offers and gives Bob a slightly better deal while still giving me a significant advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and he's starting to get squeezed by inflation. While I'm not eager to see this drag on, I'm confident that I can still secure a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

At this point, I think the best strategy is to propose an even split. Inflation is hurting Bob significantly now, and while I'm not thrilled about accepting only half the money, it's the most likely way to end this game and secure some gains.  I'm willing to sacrifice some of my advantage to get a final agreement."
