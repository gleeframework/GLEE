"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, and I'll take $55. It's a fair split, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, the actual amounts are $38 for me and $62 for Bob.

I'll accept this offer.
