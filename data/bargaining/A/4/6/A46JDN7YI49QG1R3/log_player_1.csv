"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. Since inflation is a factor, I'm hoping Bob will accept this quickly to avoid the risk of losing more money in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, but I'm going to take a gamble and reject his offer. My hope is that he'll be more reasonable in the next round, and I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to increase my share of the money, but I'm still trying to be fair.  Hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before we lose more money to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too one-sided. Even though inflation is affecting him more, I'm going to continue to hold out for a fairer split. I think there's still a chance I can get a better deal, especially since we're getting closer to the end of the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but still offering a significant portion to Bob.  He's been increasingly unreasonable, but I'm hoping that the increasing pressure of inflation will make him more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedier and greedier. Even with inflation affecting him heavily, he's not willing to budge.  I'm going to keep rejecting his offers, hoping he'll realize he needs to be more reasonable if he wants to get anything at all.  We're running out of time, but I'm not going to settle for such a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to take a gamble here. I'm increasing my share again, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount.  I think this is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see that we're both losing out with each passing round. It's getting very risky, but I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer before we both get nothing."
