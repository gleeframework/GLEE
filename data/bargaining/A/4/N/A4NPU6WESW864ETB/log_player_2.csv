Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This is the last round where I'll accept a less than even split.  Any more rounds and the inflation hurts me too much.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
