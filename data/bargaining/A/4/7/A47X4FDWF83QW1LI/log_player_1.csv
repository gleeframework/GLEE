"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our game!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's start with a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Considering the inflation, my gain of $50 is actually worth 80% of the initial $50, which is $40. Bob's gain of $50 remains the same as in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I did in the first round, but meeting in the middle might be a good strategy. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
