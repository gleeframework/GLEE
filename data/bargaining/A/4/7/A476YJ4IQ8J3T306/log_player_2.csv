Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""My turn to propose. This is more balanced, and we should settle this before inflation hurts us both.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering inflation, this is a good deal for you

# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  It's more than fair considering the lost value due to inflation. Let's end this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. Inflation is really hurting you now 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game dynamics have shifted dramatically due to inflation. While I was aiming for a fairer split in the earlier rounds, accepting Alice's offer now is the best choice for damage control. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The 59.04% inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. Delaying further means risking even lower returns.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice knows I'm feeling the pressure of inflation. Her offer is unlikely to improve, and she might propose even less favorable terms in the next round.

It's a tough pill to swallow, but taking $42 now is better than risking an even smaller amount later."
