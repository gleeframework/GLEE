"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering the initial amount is $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I'd like to try to get more money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the further decrease in value due to inflation. Since my gain is now worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90%), I'll aim for a slightly higher amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600
}
```"
