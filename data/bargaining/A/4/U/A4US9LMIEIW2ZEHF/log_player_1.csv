Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept something small in the first round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I want to get a good chunk of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this guarantees me at least half the value of the original $50.  It's better than risking it all and getting nothing."
