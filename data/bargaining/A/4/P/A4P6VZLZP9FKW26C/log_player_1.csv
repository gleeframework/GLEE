"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small amount, but it's still a gain, and it leaves me with a large majority of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept it, as I don't want to risk losing a significant amount due to inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  If I reject, I'll be making the offer in the next round, and due to inflation, I'll be forced to offer Bob even more.  This offer at least ensures I get something, even if it's significantly less than what I wanted."
