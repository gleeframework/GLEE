"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 60% this time, and we can see what happens next round! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the adjusted values. In this round, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of the original $6000 I would have gotten in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 90% of the original $6000 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split again, especially since the value of the money is decreasing. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is a slight concession from my initial 60-40 offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, 55-45 is a fair split for this round.""
}
```"
