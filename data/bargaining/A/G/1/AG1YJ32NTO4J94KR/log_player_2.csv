**Reasoning:**

While this offer is still significantly skewed in Alice's favor, it's the best offer we're likely to get. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer we wait, the less our share is worth. We've already lost almost 20% of the value from the initial potential offer.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice knows about the inflation working against us. She's consistently offered slightly more each round, likely hoping to string us along until we're desperate enough to accept a bad deal. 
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. She might stick to this offer or even decrease it, knowing the pressure is on us.

Taking $430,000 now is better than risking getting even less later."
