Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split seems fair, given the inflation.  We can't both be greedy here, and the longer we wait, the less we both get.  Let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
