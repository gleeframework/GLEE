"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both walk away happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a decent amount considering the initial $100. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
