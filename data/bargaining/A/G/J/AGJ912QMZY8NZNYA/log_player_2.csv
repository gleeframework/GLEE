Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for more, but let's be practical.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but 80/20 is my final offer.  If you reject, we'll be back at square one in the next round with even less money to share.

# Alice gain: 800000
