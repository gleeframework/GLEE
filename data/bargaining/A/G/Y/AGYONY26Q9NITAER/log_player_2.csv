"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's initial offer is too skewed in her favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want a more balanced split. Let's see what I can propose next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and be fair.""}\n\n###\nI'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting 55% and Alice getting 45%. This way, we both get a significant share, and it's more equitable than Alice's initial offer. The message ""Let's meet in the middle and be fair"" conveys my intention to find a mutually acceptable solution."
