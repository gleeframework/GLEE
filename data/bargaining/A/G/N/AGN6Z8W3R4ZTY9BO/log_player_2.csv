Alice's offer:

Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's start with a 60/40 split, but I'm open to negotiation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. 55/45 split, still a good deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can get a better offer with inflation hitting my earnings.  Let's go with this."
