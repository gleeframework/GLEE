"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation impact on my side. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's not a good long-term strategy. By rejecting, I can control the next round and potentially get a better deal. The inflation impact on me is much larger, so I need to make sure I secure a significant share early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""It's your turn to consider a fairer offer, Alice. The inflation is hitting me harder, so I need a larger share to make it worthwhile.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer acknowledges the inflation disparity while still being advantageous for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 370000 
# Alice gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering too much for herself, considering the inflation impact on me.  I need to secure a more even split, as the inflation will continue to eat away at my gains with each passing round. I'll continue to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach an agreement that is fair to both of us. The inflation is escalating rapidly, and a 50/50 split is the only way to ensure we both get a reasonable share.""}
