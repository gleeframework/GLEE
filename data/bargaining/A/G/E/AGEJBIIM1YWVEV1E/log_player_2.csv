"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take most of the money but I'll give you a decent share to start with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's proposal is not acceptable to me, as I believe I can get a better deal in subsequent rounds. Despite the threat of inflation, I'm willing to take the risk to potentially increase my share. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I want a bigger share!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 6000. Let's split it 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Alice's offer again. Although inflation is taking its toll on the value of the money for me, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. With the current offer, I'd be getting $3000, but due to inflation, it's actually worth less than that. I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a more favorable split. Let's see what Alice has to say to my next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Getting closer, but I need a bit more. Inflation is biting!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down a bit more, but I need at least 6500.  Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Alice's offer this time. Although the money is worth significantly less to me due to inflation, I think it's time to cut my losses and take what I can get. With the current offer, I'd be getting $3500, which is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Let's finalize the deal and end the game here.
