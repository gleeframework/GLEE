Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'll take 70%, you take 30%.  We both get more than in the previous round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of my larger inflation rate. While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a more equitable split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  This is my final offer before the inflation really starts to hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Ideally, I wanted a larger share. However, Alice is correct that the inflation is starting to significantly impact both of us.  Accepting her 60/40 split now is better than risking getting even less in later rounds, or even worse, walking away with nothing."
