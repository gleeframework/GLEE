"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly uneven split is more fair, considering the risk we both take in continuing the game.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too uneven. I'd like to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll, and my potential gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round. I'll have to be strategic. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both taking a risk here.  I'm willing to offer you a little less, but I think this split is fair given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger hit, my potential gain is worth significantly less. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better. I'll hold out for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really eating away at my potential gain now. I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going back to a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to wait""
}
```

I'm trying to get back to a fair split, but I'm aware that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."
