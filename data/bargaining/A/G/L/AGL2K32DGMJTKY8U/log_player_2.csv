"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Okay, my turn. How about a slightly better deal for me this time?  It's still a win-win.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It was essential to reject it to signal that I'm aiming for a fairer outcome. 
* **My Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a 52.5%-47.5% split in my favor.  
    * This is a more balanced offer than Alice's, making it more likely she'll consider it. 
    * The slight advantage for me accounts for the fact that the money is losing value for me with each round due to inflation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a deal that is as close to 50-50 as possible while factoring in the inflation disadvantage.  I need to balance being assertive to get a good deal with being reasonable enough that Alice doesn't reject my offer outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to appear conciliatory by saying ""meet me in the middle,"" but her offer is far from the middle. While it's slightly better than her first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the money is now worth almost 10% less for me. 

**Strategy:**

Alice's second rejection suggests she might be willing to push this to the final round. I need to decide if I want to make another counter-offer or risk it all on a final round where I'll have significantly less bargaining power."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5125,
""alice_gain"": 4875,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. Let's be realistic - we both lose if we go to the last round. This split is fair and avoids further losses for both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** This is the last round where I can make an offer.  The next round leaves me at Alice's mercy, with the money worth even less.
* **Finality:** Framing this as my ""final offer"" adds weight and urgency for Alice to consider seriously.
* **Slight Concession:**  I've reduced my desired share slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but it's still a better split than her previous offers.

**Strategy:**  

By being firm yet making a minor concession, I'm aiming to convince Alice that accepting now is the most logical choice to avoid a worse outcome for both of us in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, I won't go lower 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough pill to swallow, but I have no choice. Here's why:

* **Last Round:**  This is the final round. If I reject Alice's offer, she gets to propose a division where I have zero negotiating power and the money will be worth even less to me.
* **Significant Loss:** While 45% is much lower than I aimed for, rejecting this means risking an even worse outcome in the final round. Alice knows this and is unlikely to offer anything better.

**Outcome:**

Alice played hardball and successfully exploited the game's mechanics and my time pressure.  While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures I at least receive something rather than risking a worse outcome by holding out for a better deal that will never come."
