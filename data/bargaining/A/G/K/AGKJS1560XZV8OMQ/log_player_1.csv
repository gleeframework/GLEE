"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm starting with a fair offer, offering Bob a 50/50 split. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better than 40%."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has affected Bob's gain more significantly, I'll make a new proposal that takes that into account. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share, but still a reasonable split, considering the inflation has reduced the value of his gain. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on Bob's gain, and he's making a more aggressive offer this time. However, I think I can still do better.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject this offer, as I'm not willing to give up more than 40% of the total. I'm hoping Bob will come back with an even more generous offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the significant inflation that's affecting Bob's gain, I'll make a new proposal that takes that into account. Here's my offer for Round 5:

  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering a more favorable split, considering the reduced value of Bob's gain. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
