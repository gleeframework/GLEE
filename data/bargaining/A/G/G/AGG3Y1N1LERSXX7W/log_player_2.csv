**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing rapidly, Alice is getting increasingly aggressive and inflexible. It's highly likely she's trying to pressure me into accepting a less-than-ideal deal. I'm willing to gamble that she'll be more open to a fairer split as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Take it before we both lose out!"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

The clock is ticking and Alice is clearly playing hardball. It's time to stand firm on a fair and simple offer. A 50/50 split is the most logical solution at this point. This puts the pressure back on Alice without being overly aggressive."
