{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be reasonable. This offer ensures we both benefit from a deal now.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle of our last offers. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses due to inflation.  Bob seems persistent in wanting a larger share, and waiting could lead to even less favorable proposals in future rounds."
