"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000} 
```

This offer gives Bob a small portion, hoping he will accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation and potentially getting a worse deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, rejecting it is the best strategy. The 5% inflation on my gains isn't significant enough to justify accepting a deal that gives me only 100,000.  In the next round, I will be the one making the offer, and I can use the knowledge of Bob's willingness to offer a near-even split to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

This offer aims to strike a balance.  By offering Bob a larger share than in the first round, I acknowledge the risk of continued inflation, but still maintain a significant portion for myself.  I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering his previous willingness to offer a near-even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation has significantly eroded my potential gains. Accepting this offer is the best option at this point.  The 14.26% inflation means I'm already losing a significant portion of my potential earnings, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
