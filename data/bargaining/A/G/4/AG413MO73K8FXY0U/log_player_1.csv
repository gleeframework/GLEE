"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's think about why this is a good idea:

* **Future Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I put myself in the position to make a counter-proposal in the next round. This gives me some control over the situation.
* **Bob's Impatience:** Bob's money is losing value quickly due to the 20% inflation rate. Each round, his potential gains decrease, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal in the future. 

While Bob's offer isn't terrible, it's likely I can secure a better deal by being patient and strategic."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""This offer still gives you a good share, Bob, and it's the best you'll get considering the inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:**  Bob's potential gains just decreased another 20% due to inflation.  He's now more likely to accept an offer that favors me more than he would have in previous rounds. 
* **Firm but Fair:** While I'm increasing my share, I'm still offering Bob a reasonable amount. This offer aims to find a balance between maximizing my gains and ensuring Bob doesn't feel completely lowballed and reject out of spite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation hurts, I need a bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling Bob's Bluff:**  While Bob claims he needs a bigger share due to inflation, his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor.  He's feeling the pressure, but I need to hold firm to secure a better outcome.
* **Approaching the Brink:** We're reaching a critical point in the negotiation.  Bob's gains are significantly reduced, and he'll be desperate to reach an agreement soon. My next offer needs to reflect this urgency."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is the same offer I gave you in Round 1.  The clock is ticking, and it's only hurting you. Let's be reasonable and end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Ultimatum:** I'm returning to my initial offer, highlighting how Bob's stalling tactics have only hurt his potential gains.  This creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the cost of further delays.
* **Psychological Impact:** By presenting the same offer again, I aim to create a sense of disappointment for Bob. He could have accepted this deal earlier, but now his potential share has been significantly reduced due to his own inaction.
* **Potential for Acceptance:**  While there's a chance Bob could reject this offer out of frustration, it's also highly likely he'll recognize the writing on the wall. Accepting my offer now is the only way for him to salvage a decent portion of the initial $10,000."
