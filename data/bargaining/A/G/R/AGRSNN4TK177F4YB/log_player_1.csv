"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split, with me getting 750,000 and Bob getting 250,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his own proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 500000 * 0.95 = 475000
* Bob gain: 500000 * 0.95 = 475000

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
