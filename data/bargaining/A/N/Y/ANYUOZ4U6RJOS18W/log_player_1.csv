Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than your initial offer. This proposal is more equitable, and it still allows us both to get a significant share of the money before it loses value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
