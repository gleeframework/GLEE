"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While it seems like a decent amount now, the inflation will hurt me much more than her in subsequent rounds. I need to aim for a much better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, my turn. I understand you want a fair deal, but the inflation impacts me far more than you. This offer accounts for that difference and gives us both a chance to get a decent amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer still gives you a significant portion, and it accounts for the fact that the value decreases faster for me.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting slightly better, but it's still not good enough.  She's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money devalues faster for her, but my offer in round 2 was much fairer considering the inflation.  I need to hold firm and aim for a better split, even with the increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and the value is decreasing. My offer is still the most reasonable considering the inflation. It's time to find a compromise.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a straight 50/50 split to end this before we both lose out.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally getting serious. While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal in earlier rounds, the rapid devaluation of the money makes this offer acceptable now. It's better to take a guaranteed win than risk getting nothing at all."
