"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but still fair. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $3,000 is worth 90% of the original $6,000, which is $2,700, and Bob's gain of $7,000 is worth 80% of the original $4,000, which is $5,600.

I'm not sure I like this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not take a smaller share, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on a slightly bigger share for you, Bob. Your turn!""

```"
