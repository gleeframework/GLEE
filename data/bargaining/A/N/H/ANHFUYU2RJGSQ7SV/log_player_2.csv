"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 60/40 split. Let's get this started! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice's next proposal will be."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I think 70/30 is a more equitable split, given that the value of the money will decrease in subsequent rounds. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's go with 45/55. It's a fair deal considering the diminishing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. It's better to take the 5500 now, rather than risk getting nothing if we keep going and the money keeps depreciating."
