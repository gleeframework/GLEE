"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's turn the tables. I'm offering you a fair share, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $100,000 in this round is actually worth $95,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept. I'm being offered a smaller share than I was initially, and the value of my share is also decreasing due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 1 due to inflation. My gain of $100,000 in this round is actually worth $90,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share. Consider this offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my principles.  This is my final offer.  Accept it or we'll both get less. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less due to inflation, my gain of $150,000 in this round is actually worth $87,225.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the idea of accepting a smaller share, but I also don't want to risk getting an even smaller share in the next round due to further inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
