**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but time is working against me more than her. I need to signal I'm willing to compromise but not be pushed around.  I'll hold firm for one more round and see if she gets nervous."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Okay, okay. You drive a hard bargain. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aiming to get more than half, but my position is weakening with every round due to the inflation. Offering a 50/50 split now shows I'm willing to compromise for a fair deal, and it puts the pressure on her. If she rejects this, it makes her look greedy and increases the chance of her getting nothing in the end."
