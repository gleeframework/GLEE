"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work out something more balanced later on. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is better than nothing, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. Bob can get a much better deal if he holds out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be more reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Time is money, Alice!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We can both benefit from this, and there's no need to keep haggling. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes sense for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob. Waiting longer means he'll get even less in real terms. 
* **Fair Offer:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair.  Holding out for a significantly better deal might not be realistic given Alice's previous offer.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a reasonable share, while rejecting it risks getting nothing if they can't reach an agreement in subsequent rounds."
