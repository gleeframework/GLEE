Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said it's your final offer, but I think we can still negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to frame her offer as generous, the decreasing value of the money means I need to be very careful. Accepting $4500 now is much worse than potentially getting a slightly better deal in a later round. I'm willing to risk it, as the difference is significant due to the rapid inflation."
