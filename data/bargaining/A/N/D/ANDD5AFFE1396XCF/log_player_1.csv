I'm going for a fairly aggressive first offer.  I want to secure a large portion of the money while acknowledging that Bob needs to get something too. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation is hitting me hard, and a 50/50 split is better than nothing."
