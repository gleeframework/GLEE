Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I want to see how Bob reacts to this. Since I know the money is worth less to Bob with each round, I'm hoping he'll take even a small amount in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much better offer for me, even with the inflation factored in. I'm happy to take it."
