"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation rate difference. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, it's important to consider the inflation rates.  Since Bob's money is losing value at a much faster rate (20% vs Alice's 5%), he needs to secure a higher percentage of the money early on to maximize his gains.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical about the inflation. I'm taking a larger share to compensate for my higher loss rate. If you reject this, I'll need to keep pushing for a more favorable deal in the next round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be higher, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice has increased her offer, it's still not enough for Bob. Inflation has hit Bob much harder, and accepting this offer would leave him with a significantly smaller share of the real value compared to what he could potentially get later in the game.  The longer the game goes on, the more valuable Alice's share becomes.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob another chance to negotiate for a more favorable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Inflation is a serious factor, and my losses are far greater. This offer is my final attempt at a compromise.  If you reject, I will need to protect my share even more aggressively in the next round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've taken inflation into account and made a more generous offer. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims this is her ""lowest offer,"" it's still not enough for Bob. The inflation rate is hitting him much harder, and accepting this offer would mean a significant loss compared to what he could potentially gain if he continues negotiating. It's better to risk another round and try to secure a larger share before the inflation gap widens even further."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  Inflation is severely impacting my share, and this offer reflects that. This is my final chance to secure a decent amount before we both lose even more.  If you refuse, we're both facing the risk of getting nothing at all.""
