"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I get a bit more""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since the money loses value faster for me (10% per round) than for Bob (5% per round), I want to propose a division that slightly favors me to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds. By offering myself $6000 and Bob $4000, I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable split and accept, thus ending the game quickly before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we both face. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nMy reasoning is that, although the money has lost value due to inflation, Bob's offer doesn't seem to take into account the fact that the money loses value faster for me. With his offer, not only does he get more than me, but the difference in the loss of value isn't compensated for. I think I can propose a better split in the next round, so I'll reject his offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation difference, I think this is a more balanced split""}\n\nMy reasoning is that, taking into account the loss of value from the previous rounds, I've adjusted my proposal to offer Bob a bit less than before, but still more than I'd get, in the hopes that he'll see it as a fair compromise. Since the money loses value faster for me, I'm trying to find a balance that accounts for this disparity. I've also lowered my expectations slightly to try to meet Bob halfway, considering his previous offer."
