"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, I'll give you a fair share, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Splitting it evenly seems a bit too generous for me, considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is still affecting me, and I need to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now. My gains are worth 27.1% less than they were initially, and I need to be careful not to give away too much.

However, Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the current value of the money. I'd rather get a larger share to make up for the loss in value.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting now, and I need to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any better off, Bob! This is my final offer!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on me now. My gains are worth 40.95% less than they were initially, and I'm getting desperate. However, I still need to be cautious not to give away too much.

Considering the current value of the money, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I'm not sure I can afford to give him 700,000. I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really crushing me now, and I need to make a very aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. This is my last stand!""
}
```

I'm essentially making the same offer as Bob's previous one, but I'm hoping that he'll be willing to accept it now that the stakes are higher for me."
