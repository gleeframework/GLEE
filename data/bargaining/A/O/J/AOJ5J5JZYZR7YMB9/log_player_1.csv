}
```

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now considering a smaller amount of $4,000. However, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him, considering the original amount we were dividing.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to make another proposal.
