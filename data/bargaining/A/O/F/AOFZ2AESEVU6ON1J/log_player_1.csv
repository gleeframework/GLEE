Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think a 52.5/47.5 split is more balanced, considering we're both taking the risk of inflation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
