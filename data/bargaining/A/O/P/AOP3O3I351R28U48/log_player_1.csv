I'm proposing a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor.  I want to secure a large portion of the money, knowing it's worth more to me than Bob.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with getting a smaller share, it's important to consider the inflation.  My share would be worth 90% of the initial 450,000, which is 405,000. Bob's share, even with the steeper inflation, is still a significant amount. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and get something rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
