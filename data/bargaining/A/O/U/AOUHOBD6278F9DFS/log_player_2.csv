"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is highly in your favor considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a generous offer considering the inflation will only hurt you more as time goes on. Take it while you can still secure a decent amount.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was absurd. I'm giving you another chance at a fair deal.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While my previous offer was ambitious, accepting a mere $100,000 when a million is at stake is not a gamble I'm willing to take, even with the inflation working against me. There's still time for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to negotiate, but my patience is wearing thin. A 60/40 split is my final offer.  The inflation is working against you, not me.  Take this deal before you lose even more.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're letting greed cloud your judgment.  I'm offering you 200,000 - take it or leave it. This is your last chance. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting desperate, but her offer is still unacceptable.  She's clearly banking on me panicking as the rounds progress.  While the inflation is a factor, I'm not going to settle for a pittance when a significant sum is still in play. I need to counter with a strong offer that emphasizes the shrinking pie."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  Every round that passes, the pot shrinks significantly for you. I'm offering a 55/45 split.  It's a fair deal, and your last chance at getting a reasonable amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think you enjoy wasting time.  This is my final offer. It's more than fair, and if you decline, we can both watch this money evaporate. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** It's getting too risky now. While not ideal,  $300,000 is a substantial sum.  Alice seems firm on her stance, and with each passing round, the potential losses for her are becoming less impactful. It's time to cut my losses and secure a reasonable amount.  Continuing to gamble could leave me with nothing."
