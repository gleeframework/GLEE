"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair. Let's see if we can agree on that before the money starts losing value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I might as well try to get a better deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to do better in the next round.
