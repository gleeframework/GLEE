Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice's offer is getting closer to a fairer split, but it's still skewed in her favor considering the rapid inflation working against her.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. Inflation is hitting you harder.  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I won't go below this 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

```
While not ideal, accepting a 45/55 split is better than risking getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement. Inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money, especially for Alice. She's unlikely to offer anything better than this.
