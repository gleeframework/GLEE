I'm rejecting. My strategy is to see if Bob will accept my offer in the next round. Even if he rejects, the value of my offer will stay the same. However, with the inflation affecting Bob, the offer I make in the next round will be worth more to him. I want to push for the best deal I can get."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Even though I could theoretically hold out for another round and try to get more, the risk is too high. There's no guarantee Bob will accept my offer in the final round, and even if he does, the value of the money to him will be so low due to inflation that he might not even be motivated to play. It's better to take the deal I have now, which is still a significant gain for me."
