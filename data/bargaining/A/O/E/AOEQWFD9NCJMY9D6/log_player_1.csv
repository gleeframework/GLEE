"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, deal?""
}
```

This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, but I'm hoping Bob will reject it and we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly. $50 for you and $50 for me. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, Bob! My offer was rejected, but his counteroffer is a good one.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a fair split, and I'd rather not risk going to another round with inflation eating away at our earnings."
