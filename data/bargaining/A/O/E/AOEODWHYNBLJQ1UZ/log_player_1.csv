"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer to split the money evenly, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'd be getting $400,000 instead of $500,000. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed in his favor, but it's a slight improvement from the initial 50/50 split.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'll make a new proposal in the next round.
