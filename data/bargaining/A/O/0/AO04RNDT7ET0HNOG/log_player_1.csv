"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000 and take 6000 for myself.""
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation will impact us both. Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to Bob due to the 20% inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You said 55/45 was fair, but I think I'm worth more. I'll take 7000 and leave you with 3000.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60/40 split. It's still more fair than the last offer, and I'm willing to go higher than my previous proposal. Let's settle this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than before, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
