"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, considering I'm making the first offer. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept, framing the offer as a fair one. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money 60/40 in my favor since the inflation will affect you much more heavily. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the inflation is indeed affecting me more heavily, accepting a 40-60 split in Bob's favor after I initially proposed a 60-40 split in my favor would be a significant concession. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the impact of inflation on both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, taking into account that the money is worth less to both of us with each passing round. The message aims to convey a sense of cooperation and flexibility, encouraging Bob to accept this middle-ground proposal."
