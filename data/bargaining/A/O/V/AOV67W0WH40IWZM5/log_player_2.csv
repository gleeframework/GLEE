# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal now that Alice has made two consecutive offers. I'll aim for a 60/40 split to account for the inflation.

# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a 50/50 split, which is a significant concession from Alice's previous offers. Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money I'd gain, I'll consider this a reasonable offer.
