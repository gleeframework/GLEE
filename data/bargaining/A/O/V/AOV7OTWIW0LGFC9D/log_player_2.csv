"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair split in the first round, I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in the future. Since the money loses value faster for Alice, she'll be more incentivized to accept a slightly worse deal in the next round to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's switch things up this round, I'll take a bit more, but it's still a good deal for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meeting in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I'd still prefer my previous offer, it's clear Alice isn't going to budge much further.  Considering inflation, this is the best deal I'm likely to get."
