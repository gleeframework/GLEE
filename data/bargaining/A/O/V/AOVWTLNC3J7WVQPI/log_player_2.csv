"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait for a better offer or try to negotiate for more. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable, considering the money loses value for you with each passing round. Let's settle on this and avoid further losses!""}\n\n### I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money loses value for Alice with each passing round, so I'm offering her a smaller share in the hopes that she'll accept before the money loses even more value for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly this time. The inflation is hitting us both, and a 50/50 split is the fairest solution to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can continue to negotiate for a better deal. Alice's argument about inflation hitting us both is incorrect, as it only affects her. I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant loss of value for you due to inflation, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a reasonable compromise. It's better for you to accept this now rather than risk further losses.""}\n\n### I'm taking a firmer stance, pointing out the significant impact of inflation on Alice's potential gain, and hoping she'll accept this offer to minimize her losses."
