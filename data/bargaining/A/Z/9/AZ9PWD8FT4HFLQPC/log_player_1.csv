I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This way, I get the larger share, but it still leaves Bob with something.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but if not, we can continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This time I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equal division, and I believe Bob will be more likely to accept it after rejecting my previous offer."
