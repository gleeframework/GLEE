"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference to see if we can agree quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10, which is 10% of the original $100. This way, if he accepts, I'll get $90, and we can both move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $45 is worth 5% less than my original $90, so it's equivalent to $85.95.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair split, and I'm willing to accept it. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
