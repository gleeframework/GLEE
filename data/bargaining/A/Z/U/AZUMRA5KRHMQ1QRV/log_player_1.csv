"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small amount to consider while leaving the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even with the inflation factor considered. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm lowering my share slightly to 8000, but still offering a decent amount to Bob. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give up much more."

Round 4

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even after accounting for inflation. I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself. While the inflation is getting worse, I'm still in a strong position to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still holding out for a significant portion of the money. With each round, Bob's share is shrinking due to inflation, so he has a strong incentive to accept this offer."
