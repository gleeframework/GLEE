Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  Since inflation affects us both, I'm willing to compromise with a 54/46 split in my favor. This way, we can both still get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400
