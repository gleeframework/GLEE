"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more skewed towards me this time. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a larger share as we go along. Given the significant inflation that's occurred, I'll think carefully about this offer.
