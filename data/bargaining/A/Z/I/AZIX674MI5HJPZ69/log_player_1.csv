"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a bit for myself too. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll get 0.9 * 70 = 63 dollars.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
