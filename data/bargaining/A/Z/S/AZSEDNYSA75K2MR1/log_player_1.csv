Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer.  Since the money is worth less to me each round, I want to secure as much as possible early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it seems like he's just flipping our previous proposal, remember that I'm losing 5% of the value of the money with each passing round.  I'm better off holding out and making a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm adjusting my offer slightly to acknowledge the risk of further rounds and the potential for Bob to get more aggressive with his proposals."
