"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering you 250,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in ending the game early and avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A decent offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept an offer that gives you a 60% share of the remaining money. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and let's end this!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share of the money and ending the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not budging much! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to reassess my strategy. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives you a 52% share of the remaining money, even if it's slightly better than before. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
