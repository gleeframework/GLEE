Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""My turn for a majority stake, but this ensures we both benefit significantly from an early agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  We've both had our turn at a bigger share, let's finish this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer my previous offer, accepting a 40/60 split now is better than risking further inflation.  It's a reasonable outcome at this stage."
