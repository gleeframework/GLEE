"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This ensures a significant portion for me while giving Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer a split of 800,000 to 200,000 in my favor. Bob's offer was too low, and I'm willing to compromise a bit from my initial proposal. This ensures I get a large share, while still leaving room for potential negotiations in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is higher than in the previous round, it's still considerably less than what I proposed. I'm willing to hold out for a more equitable split, especially considering the inflation impacting the value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer to 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob. Bob's last offer was still too low, and while I need to be realistic about the inflation, I'm confident I can secure a better deal than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is still less than what I initially proposed, inflation has taken a significant toll on the value of the money. It's becoming increasingly risky to reject offers. I need to be realistic and accept this offer, as further rounds may result in a much lower value for my share."
