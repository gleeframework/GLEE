"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money in a 3:1 ratio. I believe this is fair considering the potential risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 3:1 ratio might seem fair in the first round, the risk of inflation heavily favors accepting a larger share in the first round.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
