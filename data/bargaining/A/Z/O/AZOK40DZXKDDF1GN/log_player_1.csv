# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer this time.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIt's better to end the game now, as the inflation is decreasing the value of the money significantly, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round. Splitting it evenly seems like a reasonable compromise at this point."
