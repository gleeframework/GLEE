Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round. I'm sure we can both be happy with this split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough decision! Bob is being pretty stubborn, and waiting will only hurt me more.  However, his offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer was for him. I think I need to hold out a bit longer to try to get a better deal.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway this time.  Let's be pragmatic and work towards a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is slowly moving towards a more even split, but he's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me.  While this offer is closer to being ""fair"" in his eyes, it still favors him. I need to hold out a little longer to see if I can get him closer to a true middle ground.
