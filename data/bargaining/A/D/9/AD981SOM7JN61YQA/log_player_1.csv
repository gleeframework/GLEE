"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can't do better than this 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 30$ is worth 24$ in real terms, which is a significant reduction. Bob's gain of 70$ is still worth 70$.

I'm not convinced that this is the best I can do, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of 30$ is worth 24$ in real terms, and I'm not sure if I can do better. However, I still want to try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 45-55""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really hitting me hard! My gain of 20$ is now worth only 10.4$ in real terms. I'm getting desperate, but I don't want to give in to Bob's greed.

I'll reject this offer, hoping that I can still negotiate a better deal.

```

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm running out of options and the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I'll make a final push for a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, let's split it 35-65, I'm getting desperate""
