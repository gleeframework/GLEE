"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is for a 70/30 split, I'm not thrilled about it. However, I also don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to accept this offer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
