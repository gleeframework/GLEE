"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, $5,000 is equivalent to $4,000 in the first round's value. And since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, $5,000 is equivalent to $4,750 in the first round's value.

I think this offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
