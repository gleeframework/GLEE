Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep the majority of the money, but give Bob a small share to ensure the game progresses. This will allow me to potentially secure a larger share in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
