"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split. I'm aiming for a large share, but I think it's fair considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing due to further inflation."
