"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer, aiming to secure most of the money early on. It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but it sets the stage for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more reasonable than my initial proposal, but I'm not willing to settle for such a drastic split just yet. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, aiming for a more balanced split.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but still leaves me with a substantial share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is more favorable to him than my last offer, but with the significant inflation, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'll accept this offer to secure at least some of the money."
