Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather take a bigger share now than risk losing more to inflation 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, Alice is clearly feeling the inflation pinch more than Bob.  She's consistently aiming for a larger share, but her offers are getting weaker. Bob can likely secure a better deal by continuing to hold out, as long as he doesn't get too greedy."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly even split. Take it before inflation eats away any more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  Alice's desperation to secure a larger share is evident, but her offers are becoming less favorable for Bob. By offering a 50/50 split, Bob presents an offer that is increasingly attractive to Alice as inflation eats away at her potential gains.  This is a strong power play designed to end the negotiation favorably for Bob."
