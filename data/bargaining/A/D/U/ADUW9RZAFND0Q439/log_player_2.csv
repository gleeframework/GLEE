Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob, but this is my final offer! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll think about it... Ah, yes!
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think 45 is a reasonable amount, considering the inflation. It's better to take it now rather than risking another round."
