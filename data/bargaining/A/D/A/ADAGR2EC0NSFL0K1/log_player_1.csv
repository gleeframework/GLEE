Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice.  Let's split it 65/35. Remember, the money loses value each round, so it's better to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65
