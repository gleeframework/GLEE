"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share this round, but we can work things out later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous for the first round, it's not sustainable. The decreasing value of the money for Bob means he needs to be more strategic and ensure he gets a bigger share before the value drops too much."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money more evenly. We both need to make sure we get a reasonable amount, especially with the inflation.""}
