"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this 100k and let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 100k is a decent amount, there's a good chance Alice will get even greedier in the next round. Let's see what she offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 900000,
  ""alice_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm sure you'll agree, Alice. This is a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40, considering the inflation we both faced. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, considering the inflation and the risk of Alice getting even more greedy, 400,000 is a decent amount. Accepting ensures I get something, and it's better than potentially getting nothing if we keep playing."
