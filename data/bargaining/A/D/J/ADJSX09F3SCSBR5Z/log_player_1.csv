Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest.  The value will only decrease from here, so let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
