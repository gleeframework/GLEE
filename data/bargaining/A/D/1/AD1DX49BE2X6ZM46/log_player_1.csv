"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me taking the larger share. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to the middle this time. I think this is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less in each round, I'm willing to take the risk of waiting another round to try to get a larger share. Additionally, Bob's offer of a 45-55 split is still not quite in the middle, so I'm hoping to negotiate a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Getting closer to the middle, let's end this""}\n\nI'm offering a 52-48 split, which is closer to the middle than my previous offer. Since the money is worth 10% less in each round, I'm trying to find a compromise that Bob will accept. My message to Bob suggests that this is a reasonable offer and that we should end the game now to avoid further losses due to inflation."
