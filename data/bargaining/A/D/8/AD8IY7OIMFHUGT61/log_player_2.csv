Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept this offer right away.  I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 
 
I'm going to offer Alice a 60/40 split in my favor. I think this is a fair deal, considering that I'm taking the risk of rejection and moving on to the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less, I think I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 65/35. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Alice to accept, as the money is losing value with each passing round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm going to accept this offer. While the money is worth significantly less now, a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
