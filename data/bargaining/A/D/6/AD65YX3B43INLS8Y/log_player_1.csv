"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 4:1 ratio, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

I'm not thrilled about the 2:3 ratio, but I think it's a bit more generous than my initial offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 10:10 ratio, which seems like a more balanced split. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger share, but it's still a decent split for you! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the 48.8% decrease, the numbers are getting smaller quickly.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the 1:3 ratio, but I don't want to let it go to waste. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I need to make a decision. Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3750,
  ""bob_gain"": 6250,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's find a middle ground!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:5 ratio, which is a bit more skewed towards Bob's favor. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a big share, but I think it's fair this time! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less than a third of what it was initially! I'm not thrilled about the 1:9 ratio, but I think I'm running out of options.

Considering the offer, I'll have to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like Bob is getting the majority of the remaining money, but I'm glad I can finally end this game."
