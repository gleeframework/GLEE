Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I expect Bob to be more risk-averse due to the lower inflation rate on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation makes a 50/50 split more appealing in the long run. It's better to secure some gains than risk getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting offers."
