"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me the majority of the money ($9,000), but it still leaves Bob with something ($1,000).  This is a starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to accept this offer.  The inflation is already taking a bite out of the money and it's likely to get worse.  It's important to secure some gains before they become worthless."
