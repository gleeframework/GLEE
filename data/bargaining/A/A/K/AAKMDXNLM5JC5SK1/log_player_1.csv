"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer.  I want to maximize my share, but still give Bob something to think about.  If he rejects this, I'll need to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation rate is significant. Accepting this offer ensures I get half the money, even if it's worth less than the initial offer. It's a good compromise to avoid losing out entirely."
