"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is highly in your favor considering the depreciation with each round. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  I'm taking a hit with inflation. This is a strong offer considering your losses will increase each round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm taking a big risk with inflation. This offer is more than fair considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation. While her offer in Round 2 was heavily skewed in her favor, this offer is the opposite.  I need to show strength and demonstrate I'm not going to be pushed around by her framing of the inflation impact."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  This offer is a compromise that accounts for the inflation affecting both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer moves closer to the middle ground, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Time Pressure:**  By highlighting the time pressure (""stop wasting time""), I increase the psychological impact of her potential losses each round. 
* **Framing:**  I frame the offer as a compromise that recognizes the inflation affecting ""both of us,"" even though her losses are proportionally larger. This aims to make the offer seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to a stalemate. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Power Play:** Alice is trying a classic negotiation tactic by making it a ""final offer.""  This is meant to create pressure, but it's likely a bluff.
* **Still Unfavorable:** Even with the increased inflation impacting her, the offer is still tilted in Alice's favor. I believe I can get a better deal. 
* **Time Remaining:**  We still have several rounds left.  While time is a factor, panicking now will weaken my position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this money. This is my final offer - it's a fair split that lets us both walk away winners.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Play:**  Alice tried the ""final offer"" tactic, so I'm mirroring it to show I'm serious.  
* **Slight Concession:** I've moved my offer slightly closer to her last proposal to demonstrate some flexibility. 
* **Urgency:**  While I don't explicitly mention the dwindling rounds, the ""final offer"" framing implies a sense of urgency. 
* **Positive Framing:**  Ending on a note of ""walking away winners"" attempts to create a more collaborative and less adversarial tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm serious. Time is running out. This is my absolute final offer. Don't let greed ruin both our chances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are now past the halfway point, and the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing substantially. 
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers have been steadily decreasing, and it's unlikely they will significantly improve from here. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in the next few rounds isn't worth the risk of losing everything if the negotiations completely stall.
* **""Absolute Final Offer"":** While likely a bluff, there's a chance she might be serious. Calling her bluff at this stage is too risky.

While 400,000 isn't ideal, it's a significant sum, and in this situation, it's better to secure a win than gamble on a potentially better outcome and end up with nothing."
