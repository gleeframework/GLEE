"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Take 2000, I'll take 8000. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

This offer gives me a significant amount, but still leaves Bob with a decent sum. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a balanced offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 10% less than before, so I need to be more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but don't expect more!""
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm trying to squeeze a bit more for myself. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit more aggressive. You're getting less and less with each round, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are catching up with me! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be very careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my potential gain is dwindling rapidly. I need to be strategic and make the most of this round. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Time to get serious, Bob. 50/50 is as fair as it gets. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can finally settle this."
