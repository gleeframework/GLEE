"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 45
* Bob gain: 45

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
