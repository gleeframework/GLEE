  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the money, which is a relatively small amount, leaving me with 70% to give me a good buffer for future negotiations. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take more, Bob! I'll hold out for a better deal.""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the money is worth 5% less for me now. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob!"
