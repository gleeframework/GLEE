  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. This way, we both get a decent amount and can still negotiate further if you want.""

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'll reject it. I'm not getting a good deal, and I'm not sure if I want to give up too much too early. I'll wait for a better offer.
