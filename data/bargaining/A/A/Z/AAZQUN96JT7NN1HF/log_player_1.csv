Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting point heavily favors you, especially with inflation on your side.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to account for the decreasing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
