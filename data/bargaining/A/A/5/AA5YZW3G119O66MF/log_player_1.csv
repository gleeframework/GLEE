I'm proposing a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor. I want to start with a large share, knowing that the money will depreciate with each round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation will continue to erode the value of the money with each round. Accepting a 50/50 split guarantees me a significant portion of the money.  It's better than risking a further reduction in my share in the next round."
