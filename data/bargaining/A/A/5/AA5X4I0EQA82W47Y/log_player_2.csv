"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Bob. This is to encourage fairness and cooperation. Let's work together. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's proposal seems fair, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Rejecting allows me to make a counter-proposal and potentially secure a larger share of the dwindling money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Let's reverse the ratio. I believe in fairness, but I'm also aware of the inflation risk. This offer reflects our mutual benefit in a shrinking pie.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a new 4:1 ratio in favor of Bob. This aims to balance the value loss while still being fair. Let's strive for a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob gain: 387500 
# Alice gain: 612500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to have a significant impact. Accepting this offer ensures a gain, albeit reduced, and avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
