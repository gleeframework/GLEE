"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's my turn to make a more reasonable offer 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a new proposal for Round 3. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to give you a bigger share, but still a good deal for me.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting stingy, now it's time for me to make a more aggressive move 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is catching up!

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Considering the inflation, I'll make a new proposal for Round 5, trying to account for the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 67.5,
  ""message"": ""A revised offer, taking into account the inflation's impact on my share.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""A more moderate offer, trying to find a balance in the current economic conditions.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm going to take a bigger share now 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Considering the significant decrease in the value of my share, I'll make a new proposal for Round 7, trying to hold on to a smaller but still reasonable amount:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""A last-ditch effort to salvage a decent share, given the inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 22.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 77.5,
  ""message"": ""A final attempt to find a compromise, with a slightly reduced share for me.""
}
```"
