750000.0,250000.0,I propose dividing the money into 750k for me and 250k for you. This seems fair considering the risk of inflation over the 12 rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,I believe a 60/40 split is a fairer reflection of the potential risks and rewards involved in the remaining rounds.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
