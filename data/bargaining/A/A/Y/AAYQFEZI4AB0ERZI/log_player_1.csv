"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and leave you with 40% for now, but I'm open to negotiations 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the remaining amount, but I'm also not sure if I can do better. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits of continuing to negotiate.

For now, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this round, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal overall. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous this round, but I'm still hoping to negotiate a better deal in the long run."
