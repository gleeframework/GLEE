"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a generous offer considering I'll be the one making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the offer is a 40-60 split in Bob's favor, it's not as favorable as my initial offer. However, it's still a reasonable proposal considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer to account for the reduced value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which should give me a slightly higher share of the reduced value of the money."
