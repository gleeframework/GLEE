"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, seems fair""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, where I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split this time 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the money is now worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

With the new offer, I'd be getting $600,000, which is worth 5% less than the $700,000 I initially proposed. And Bob would be getting $400,000, which is worth 20% less than the $500,000 I initially proposed.

Given the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is more reasonable than the first one. I'll accept Bob's offer.
