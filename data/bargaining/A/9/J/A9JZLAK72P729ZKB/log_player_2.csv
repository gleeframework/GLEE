Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  Let's work together to reach a deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%. Let's meet in the middle at 70/30. If you reject this, we're just going to keep going down in value. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a better deal, the continued inflation means that accepting now is the best strategy to maximize my gains.  Even though my share is lower than my original offer, it's still more than if we continue and my share keeps decreasing in value."
