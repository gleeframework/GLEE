"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start! Accept my offer and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a generous 20% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain would be 7600 in the first round, but now it's worth 5% less, so it's 7220.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about splitting it 50/50, as it's not a very advantageous offer for me. However, I don't want to wait for another round and risk losing more value due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
