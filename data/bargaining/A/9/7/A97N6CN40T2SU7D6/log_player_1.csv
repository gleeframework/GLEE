"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'm now considering a proposal that's worth 80% of my initial offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer since it's not as favorable to me as my initial proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money I'll receive. Since my previous offer was 500,000, and it's now worth 80% of its original value, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 51.2% of its original value, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount. My previous offer was 500,000, which is now worth 51.2% of its original value, so I'd be getting 256,000 (51.2% of 500,000). Bob's offer is 350,000, which is higher than that.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
