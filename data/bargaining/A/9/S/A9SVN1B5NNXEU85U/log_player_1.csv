"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since I'm the one making the next proposal, I want to make a better offer than Bob's.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to avoid any further erosion of my share's value due to inflation."
