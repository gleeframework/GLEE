"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7 to 3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $7,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $6,650. And Bob's $3,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $2,400.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'd like to reject it. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
