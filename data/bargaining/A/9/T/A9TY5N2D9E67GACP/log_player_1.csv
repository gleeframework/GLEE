"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and divide it almost equally, considering the inflation""}\n\nI'm offering $5,500 for myself and $4,500 for Bob. Given that the value of money decreases by 10% for me and 5% for Bob with each round, starting with a slightly higher share seems reasonable to compensate for the higher depreciation on my side. This division still leans towards fairness but acknowledges the differing impacts of inflation on our shares."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but your offer was too low. Let's be a bit more realistic. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting $4,500 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a lower amount in the first round due to the 10% decrease in value. I need to push for a better offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Bob's offer doesn't compensate enough for the loss in value I incur with each passing round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increased loss from inflation and the need for a buffer, I'm adjusting my offer. This division still allows us both a significant share but acknowledges the growing impact of inflation on my potential gain.""}\n\nGiven the increasing pressure from inflation and the fact that Bob's offer in Round 2 didn't adequately address the value loss, I'm revising my offer to secure a slightly larger share. This adjustment aims to mitigate the sharper decline in value I face while still presenting Bob with a substantial sum, albeit slightly reduced to reflect the ongoing inflationary impact on both our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is hitting you harder than it's hitting me.  This offer gives us both a good deal while accounting for that. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's offer attempts to acknowledge the uneven impact of inflation, accepting $4,800 in the fourth round still doesn't adequately compensate for the 27.1% decrease in value I've incurred. Given the significant loss in value and the fact that we're still in the early rounds, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more equitable division that better offsets the substantial depreciation of my share. Pushing for a better offer is necessary to ensure a fairer outcome considering the ongoing effects of inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, now 27.1% less valuable, I need to adjust the offer to safeguard against further loss. This division still offers Bob a considerable amount but prioritizes mitigating my losses.""}\n\nAs we progress and the effects of inflation compound, with my potential gain now significantly reduced, I must adjust my strategy to counteract this loss. By offering $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob, I aim to offset the substantial depreciation of my share's value while still extending a considerable offer to Bob, albeit one that reflects the urgent need to address the disproportionate impact of inflation on my side. This approach seeks a balance that acknowledges both the decreasing value of the money and the necessity of reaching an agreement before further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time.  We both lose the more rounds we play.  I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on both our shares, with my potential gain now worth 40.95% less and Bob's worth 22.62% less, accepting a 50/50 split seems the most reasonable decision. Although the value has decreased, the offer of $5,000 each presents a fair conclusion to the negotiations, considering the progressive loss in value for both parties. Continuing the game risks further devaluation, potentially leading to a less favorable outcome. Accepting this offer ensures a fair division in light of the circumstances, bringing the negotiations to a close before the value decreases further."
