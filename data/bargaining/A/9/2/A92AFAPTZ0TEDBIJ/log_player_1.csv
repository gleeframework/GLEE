"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can end this.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair for us to each get 60% since we're both taking risks.  Accept this and we can get out of this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400000 * 0.8 = 320000
* Bob gain: 600000 * 0.8 = 480000

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. However, I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 600000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 384000
* Bob gain: 400000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 256000

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a more balanced split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```"
