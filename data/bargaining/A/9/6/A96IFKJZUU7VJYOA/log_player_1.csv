"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more even split.  Let's see if this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, I was offered $600,000, which was worth $600,000. In the second round, I'm being offered $450,000, which is worth 90% of what I was offered in the first round. So, in terms of purchasing power, I'm actually getting less than I was initially offered.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in round 2, so it's worth 81% of what I was offered in round 2. I'll take this into account when making my offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 405000,
  ""bob_gain"": 595000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering a 40.5-59.5 split, which is a bit more skewed towards Bob's favor. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
