"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split in my favor, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000. I think this is a generous offer, considering I'm the one making the first move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I want more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my potential gain of $200,000 is actually worth $190,000 in real terms, since it's 5% less than the $200,000 I would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I think I have to be realistic. I don't want to risk going to the next round with a smaller potential gain due to further inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
