"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While I would get something now, it's heavily skewed in Alice's favor. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. It's a good deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%. How about a 65/35 split? 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to move in the right direction, but it's still not a good deal for me. The inflation is hurting me more than her, so I need to push for a larger share before we run out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice! I'm proposing a 55/45 split. Let's get this done.""}
