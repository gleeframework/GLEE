"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. I'll take 6000 and you can have 4000. It's still a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
