I propose we split the money 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob. I believe this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a small share while acknowledging my superior negotiating skills. ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to 800,000.  While I recognize the inflation affecting Bob's share, I believe this offer is fair considering the value of the money is dropping for him.  Let's reach a compromise before things get worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is impacting Bob's gains significantly. Accepting this offer ensures a decent payout for me, and avoids the risk of further negotiations leading to an even smaller share."
