# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the offer seems fair on the surface, time is working against me faster than Alice. While a 50/50 split seems like the ""fair"" solution, I need to optimize for my own gains considering the steeper inflation I face.  It's risky, but I need to push for a slightly better deal while I still have some leverage."
