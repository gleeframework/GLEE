Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but considering the inflation, I'm already losing value. This is a more balanced offer. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a middle ground, but given the escalating inflation affecting my share more significantly, I need to adjust the offer slightly in my favor to make it fair. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the inflation argument to her advantage, but her offer is still not reflecting the rapid devaluation of her potential gains.  We need to push for a more significant shift in our favor while we still have time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real.  The inflation is eroding your share much faster than mine. A 50/50 split is the only truly fair option at this point.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to take a strong stance.  By round 6, the inflation disparity is significant. A 50/50 split, while initially seeming generous to Alice, is actually the fairest representation of the rapidly changing value. This offer might startle Alice into realizing the true impact of the inflation and the need for a swift agreement."
