"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can start fresh. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Let's see what Alice proposes next. 1000$ is a very small share, and even if I accept, the inflation might make it even less valuable in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  An even split seems like the best way to ensure we both get a good share.  What do you say?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but it's still a reasonable offer. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still better for her, but it's closer to what I want.  I think I can do better, especially with the inflation affecting her more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need a fair share too.  Let's close this deal and avoid further inflation risks.""
