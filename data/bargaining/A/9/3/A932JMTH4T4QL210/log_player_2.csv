Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still being generous, Bob. But I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up with inflation hitting you so hard. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I need a larger share to make this worthwhile, and this is my final offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but this is my last offer before the inflation really starts to bite us both. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is facing a 59.04% loss on his potential gains. Every round that passes makes accepting an offer dramatically less appealing. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has indicated this is her final compromise.  Rejecting this offer means future offers will likely be worse for Bob, especially with the increasing inflation working against him.
* **Time Pressure:** There are only a few rounds left. Holding out for a much better offer is extremely risky as there's a good chance they'll hit the 12-round limit and get nothing.

While $300,000 after inflation isn't ideal, it's much better than the alternative of walking away with nothing."
