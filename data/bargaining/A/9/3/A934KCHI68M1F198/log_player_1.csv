"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm willing to give you a decent share to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and take 60%, a slightly more generous offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'm willing to consider it.

I'll accept this offer for now. I'll take 400,000 and Bob will take 600,000.
