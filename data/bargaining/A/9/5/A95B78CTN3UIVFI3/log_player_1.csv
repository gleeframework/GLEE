"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you take 30.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me taking $70 and Bob taking $30. This is a relatively generous offer, considering we're starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the effective gain I'd get from Bob's offer is $45.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as I was hoping to get a bit more. However, it's a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with even lower gains due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
