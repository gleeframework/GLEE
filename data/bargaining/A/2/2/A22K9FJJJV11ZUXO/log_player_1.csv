"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'm sure we can find a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $450,000 is now worth less than before.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I think I can do better than a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again due to inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth even less. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

This offer gives me a smaller share, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
