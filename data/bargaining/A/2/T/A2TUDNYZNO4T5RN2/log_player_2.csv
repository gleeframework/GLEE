"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we split the money with me receiving $650,000 and you receiving $350,000. This seems like a fair starting point considering the inflation working against me. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This reflects the impact of inflation on both of us as the game goes on.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but your previous offer wasn't fair in light of the inflation. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  This reflects the increasing pressure on me as the game progresses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to mirror my previous offer, but the inflation dynamics have shifted. It's still advantageous for me to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're reaching a critical point. I'm adjusting my offer slightly to 52/48 in my favor.  This reflects the time pressure and the fact that your position weakens with each round.  Let's close this deal and avoid losing everything.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a straight 50/50 split to end this.  I'm losing significantly with each round due to the inflation, and I'm willing to compromise for a fair deal.  Let's be rational and split the money evenly. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally feeling the heat of the inflation. While I could push for a slightly larger share, accepting the 50/50 split guarantees a win and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
