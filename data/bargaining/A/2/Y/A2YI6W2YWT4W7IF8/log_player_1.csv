"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value of money with each round, I propose we divide the $100 in a 3:1 ratio in favor of efficiency and fairness.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This accounts for the higher rate of inflation for you. I believe this is a fair and efficient split, ensuring we both get a reasonable share before the money depreciates further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
