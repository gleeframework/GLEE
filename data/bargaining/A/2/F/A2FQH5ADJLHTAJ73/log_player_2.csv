Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's risky to push Alice further at this point.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're down to the wire with only a few rounds left. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While her share is decreasing in value, waiting doesn't guarantee I can get a significantly better deal.  
* **Risk of Losing It All:** If we don't reach an agreement, we both walk away with nothing. 

A 50/50 split is fair and ensures I get a substantial sum.
