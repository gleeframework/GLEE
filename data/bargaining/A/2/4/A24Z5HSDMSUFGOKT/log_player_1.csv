"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more aggressive split, but I think it's fair considering the negotiations have just begun. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too aggressive, I'd like to see a more even split.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 384000,
  ""bob_gain"": 616000,

I'm proposing a 38-62 split, trying to find a more balanced solution."

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000
