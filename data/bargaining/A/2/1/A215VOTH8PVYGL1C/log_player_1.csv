"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, my gain is now worth 5% less than the initial amount.

I'll consider Bob's offer. I'd rather have a slightly larger share, but I'll accept this offer to move forward.
