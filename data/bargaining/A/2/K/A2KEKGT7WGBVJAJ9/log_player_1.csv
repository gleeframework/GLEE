"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and consider the inflation, I get a bit more""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a division where I get $60 and Bob gets $40. Given the inflation rates, I believe this is a reasonable starting point. The message ""Let's be fair and consider the inflation, I get a bit more"" aims to set a tone for a fair negotiation while acknowledging the impact of inflation on our decisions.\n###\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we both face.  Let's get this done in the early rounds! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his message emphasizing fairness and the desire to conclude early, the proposed split of 55/45 in his favor does not adequately account for the disproportionate impact of inflation on my potential gains. Given that my share of the money devalues faster than Bob's, accepting this offer would put me at a disadvantage as the rounds progress. I aim to negotiate a better split that more equitably considers the differing inflation rates.\n###\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I still need a slightly higher share to offset my losses.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'm offering a division of $58 for myself and $42 for Bob. My message aims to convey a sense of compromise by moving closer to a 50/50 split but still emphasizes the need for a slightly higher share to compensate for the greater impact of inflation on my gains. By framing it as meeting closer to the middle, I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness while protecting my interests.\n###\nYour turn!"
