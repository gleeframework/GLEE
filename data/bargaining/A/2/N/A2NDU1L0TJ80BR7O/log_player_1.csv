"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering you $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates we'll need to keep in mind. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is not appealing.  While the money value decreases for both of us, I am not willing to settle for a mere $100,000 while Bob keeps the vast majority.  I need to see a more equitable split. Let's continue the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering $800,000 to myself and $200,000 to Bob.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, reflecting the ongoing inflation. Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far from fair.  The value of his offer to me has significantly decreased due to inflation, and he's still demanding a disproportionate share. We need to find a better balance.  I will not accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I am lowering my offer again to $700,000, while increasing Bob's to $300,000.  This reflects the increasing impact of inflation, but also a desire to find a compromise.  I hope Bob will recognize the value in a more equitable split before the money depreciates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable. While the value of his offer to me is even lower now due to the accelerating inflation, he is still trying to take a majority of the money. I am not willing to settle for such an unfair deal, especially with the money depreciating so rapidly.  We need to find a more balanced solution before the value of our potential earnings becomes negligible."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I am offering $600,000 to myself and $400,000 to Bob. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it acknowledges the heavy impact of inflation.  With the money quickly losing its value, I hope Bob will recognize the need to reach a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late."
