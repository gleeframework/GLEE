"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money 55/45 in favor of me. I think this is a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
