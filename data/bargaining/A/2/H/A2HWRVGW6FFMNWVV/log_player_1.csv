Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with an extremely lopsided offer. Since the value of the money decreases each round, I want to secure as much as possible for myself in the early stages. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he rejects, I'll adjust my offer slightly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to try and get more, the inflation risk is too high. Accepting a 50/50 split is the safest option to guarantee a significant share of the money."
