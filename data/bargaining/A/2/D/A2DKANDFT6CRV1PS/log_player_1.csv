"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 4/1 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give you a decent chunk. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
