Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, but the inflation is hurting you much more than me. I'm willing to be reasonable, but this needs to benefit both of us. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but time is running out.  Here's why I'll accept:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The 59.04% inflation is killing my potential gains. Waiting longer is disastrous.
* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Her language (""final offer"", emphasizing the inflation difference) suggests this is as good as it gets.
* **Something is better than nothing:**  Holding out for a tiny bit more and getting $0 is a terrible outcome. 

While not ideal, $3800 is better than the risk of getting nothing if the game collapses."
