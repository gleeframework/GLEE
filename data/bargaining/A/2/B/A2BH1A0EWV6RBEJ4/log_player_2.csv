"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start off fair, Bob.  This gives you a good chunk to avoid too much inflation later. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept that.  I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""This is a much fairer split.  Let's get this over with.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be generous, Bob, but I need a bigger share than that. Don't forget the inflation is working against you. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's not ideal, but inflation is a real threat, and getting something is better than nothing."
