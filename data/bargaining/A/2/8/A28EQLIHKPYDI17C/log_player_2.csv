"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice acknowledges the inflation, the proposed split gives her a significant advantage from the start.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such an uneven starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's keep it simple and split it evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to adjust slightly from my previous offer. Time is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's adjustments are very small considering we've lost a round to inflation. I need to see more significant movement to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Time is indeed ticking, and we both lose if this drags on. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to reach an agreement quickly, but I need a realistic offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to account for the inflation working against me. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is being stubborn, and her ""final offer"" is barely a concession.  While I could push for more, the risk of walking away with nothing is becoming too high with each passing round. Accepting this offer ensures we both get something."
