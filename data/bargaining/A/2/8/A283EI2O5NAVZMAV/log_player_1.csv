"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think 300,000 is a fair share for me, considering the inflation rate is 10% and I was initially offered 600,000. I'd like a higher share to account for the decreased value of money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rate and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a slightly higher share to account for the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I think this is still a fair compromise considering the current value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to stick to a 50-50 split, but with the inflation rates, my share is worth less than it was in the previous rounds. I'll think carefully about this offer.
