"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent chunk, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small share, but still a decent amount, to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if you'll accept it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my calculation is:

My gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000 (in terms of original value)
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79 (in terms of original value)

I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation. I'll accept the offer.
