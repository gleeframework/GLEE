Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice.  Let's try a more balanced split this time, and see where we end up. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
