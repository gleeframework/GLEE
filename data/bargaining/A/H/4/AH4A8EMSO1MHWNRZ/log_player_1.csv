"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll consider the effective gain as 0.95 * 400,000 = 380,000.

I'll reject the offer because I'd like to gain more.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.
