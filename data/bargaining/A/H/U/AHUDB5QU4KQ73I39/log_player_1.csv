"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This is a very simple proposal that leans heavily in Alice's favor. Since the value of the money decreases more rapidly for Bob, it's a risky move. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not a great deal for Alice, it's still more than what she would get in the next round, considering the inflation.  

It's important to remember that Bob is losing money much faster, making him more likely to accept a deal that is less favorable for him as the game goes on."
