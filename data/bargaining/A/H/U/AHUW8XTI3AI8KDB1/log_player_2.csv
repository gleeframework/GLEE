Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting worse, I still lose significantly more by accepting. It's time to show Alice I'm serious about not getting pushed around by the inflation.  Hopefully, she'll be more agreeable in the next round."
