"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept this as a fair division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer accounts for the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation adjustment, I believe I can negotiate a better split in the next round. The 20% decrease in value for me is significant, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer considering the decreased value due to inflation. I aim to find a balance that could be acceptable to Bob while maximizing my gain, given the circumstances.\n{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nI've adjusted my offer to reflect the impact of inflation, suggesting a split that slightly favors me but acknowledges the diminishing value of the money for both of us. This is an attempt to negotiate a mutually acceptable division, taking into account the decreasing value of the money over the rounds."
