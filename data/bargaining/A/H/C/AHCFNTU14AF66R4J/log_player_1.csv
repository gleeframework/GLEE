"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the most equitable way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the actual amounts would be:

Alice's gain: $500,000 x 0.9 = $450,000
Bob's gain: $500,000 x 0.9 = $450,000

Since the offer is a 50/50 split, I accept the offer.
