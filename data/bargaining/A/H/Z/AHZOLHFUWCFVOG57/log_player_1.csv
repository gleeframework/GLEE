"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$, which is 40 dollars, and keeping 60 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the new total is $95.

I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and make a new proposal. Considering the offer is 70/30, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous offer, but still in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, but I'm not giving up too much either 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer is 65/35, which is closer to a 2:1 ratio, I'll decide to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
