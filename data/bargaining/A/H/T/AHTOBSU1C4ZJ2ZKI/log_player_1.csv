"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very greedy initial offer.  I figure if I can get Bob to accept this, great! If not, the inflation will work in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to continue playing and try to get more, the inflation is a real risk.  I don't know how much it's affecting Bob, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
