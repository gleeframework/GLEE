"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority this round""}

I'm proposing that I take 60% of the initial $100 and Bob takes 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but also trying to take a slightly larger share to set the tone for the game."
