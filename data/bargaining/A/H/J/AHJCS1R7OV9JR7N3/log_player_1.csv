"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
