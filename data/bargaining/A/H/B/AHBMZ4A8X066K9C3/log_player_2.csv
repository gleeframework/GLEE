Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one. Since Alice is offering a 50-50 split, it's a fair offer, but considering the inflation, it's actually a better deal for me than my previous offer. I'll take it.
