Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a high-stakes gamble.  I'm assuming Bob is risk-averse and will likely accept even a tiny amount rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would love to keep more of the money, it's clear that Bob is willing to be more assertive this round. Accepting his offer guarantees me a substantial amount, and there's no guarantee I'll get anything better in the following rounds."
