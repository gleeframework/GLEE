"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 51/49 split in my favor. This is a fairer split considering the risk of inflation, and gives you a significant portion of the money. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
