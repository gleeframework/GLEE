"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,000 and taking $6,000 for myself, with a message that suggests this is a relatively fair division, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! How about a slightly more balanced split this time? 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation affects Bob's gain but not mine. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""You had your chance, now it's my turn again""}\n\nI'm increasing my share to $6,500 and decreasing Bob's share to $3,500, with a message that reminds Bob that he had the opportunity to accept a more balanced offer in the previous round, but now I'm taking a firmer stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's end this. I'm offering an even split to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because an even split of $5,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I don't think I can get a significantly better deal without risking Bob rejecting again and the game continuing indefinitely. Additionally, since the inflation doesn't affect my gain, I'm not under pressure to accept a worse deal, but an even split seems fair enough to conclude the game.
