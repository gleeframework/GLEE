Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive offer in the first round. I want to secure most of the money, but I'm also leaving a little for Bob. This should hopefully encourage him to accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my potential gain is 5% lower than the previous round, I think it's wise to accept.  Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous offer, and the risk of further negotiation (and potential further inflation) is too high."
