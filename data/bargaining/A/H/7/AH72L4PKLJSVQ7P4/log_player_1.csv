"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose a split of 990,000 for me and 10,000 for Bob. Since this is the first round, there is no inflation yet. I'm aiming for a large share to maximize my potential gains, but I'm also leaving a small amount for Bob to hopefully encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm raising my offer to 950,000 for myself and 50,000 for Bob. While I still want the majority share, I'm increasing Bob's amount to try and incentivize him to accept. The inflation is starting to take effect, so I need to be more strategic with my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share again, hoping to reach a compromise. The inflation is becoming more significant, so I need to make a bigger concession to secure a deal before the value of my share drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm making another significant concession, increasing Bob's share to 150,000. The inflation is rapidly reducing the value of my potential gains, so I need to secure a deal quickly. I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share again, hoping to reach a deal before the inflation completely erodes my share.  The value of my potential gains is rapidly decreasing, so I need to find a compromise quickly. I'm hoping this offer is tempting enough for Bob."
