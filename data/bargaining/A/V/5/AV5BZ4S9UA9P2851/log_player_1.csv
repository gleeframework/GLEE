"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets the remaining 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

I accept Bob's offer.
