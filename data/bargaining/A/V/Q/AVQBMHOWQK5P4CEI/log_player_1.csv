"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of $5,000 each."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% decrease in value, the money is now worth $8,000 in total.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
