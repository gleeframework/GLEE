"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give it all away.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept the offer.
