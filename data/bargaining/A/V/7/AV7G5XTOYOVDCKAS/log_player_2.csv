Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

The game has a strong time pressure element for Bob. While Alice's offers have been relatively stable, the value of the money is plummeting for Bob each round. 

* **Continuing to push for a near-even split is risky:** Even if Bob gets Alice to agree to a 50/50 split in later rounds, the impact of inflation will have significantly eroded his gains. 
* **Need to incentivize Alice:**  Alice's offers suggest she's comfortable waiting. Bob needs to offer a deal that's tempting enough for her to accept *now*, even if it means accepting a slightly smaller share than he ideally wants."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The time pressure is becoming critical for Bob. While he rejected Alice's previous offer, he needs to make a strong move to prevent the money from losing too much value. 

* **50/50 Split:**  This is the most straightforward and ""fair"" offer. By framing it as such, Bob appeals to Alice's sense of reason and desire for a quick resolution.
* **Direct Communication:**  The message is clear and emphasizes the urgency of the situation. Bob needs Alice to understand that delaying further is detrimental to both of them."
