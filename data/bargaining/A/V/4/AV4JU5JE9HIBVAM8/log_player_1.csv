Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'm considering Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a better share. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the further reduction in value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, but I'm hoping he'll accept this time."
