"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm taking 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and offering Bob $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll take 50% and you take 50%. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll. With the 20% decrease, my potential gain is now worth less than I initially thought.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give up 50% of the remaining value. Let's keep negotiating.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept the 50/50 split just yet. I want to see if we can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation continues to erode the value of the money. In this round, my potential gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round (since it's 20% less than the previous round).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 72% of the remaining value, and you can have 28%. It's a good compromise, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being realistic about the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and my potential gain is now worth only 48.8% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept your offer. 60% for me and 40% for you seems like a fair compromise, given the circumstances.""
}
```

I'll take the $600,000 and call it a day. It's not the best deal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
