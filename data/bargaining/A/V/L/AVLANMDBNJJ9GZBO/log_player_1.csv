"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the total. We can negotiate further if you want.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $600,000 in the first round is now worth $480,000.

Considering Bob's offer in the second round, I'm not impressed. I think I deserve more than $200,000, especially considering the initial offer I made was already a generous 40% to Bob.

I reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the money is really losing value quickly! My gain of $384,000 from the third round is now worth $197,312 (48.8% less).

Considering Bob's offer in the fourth round, I'm not impressed again. I think I deserve more than $300,000, especially since I've been rejecting his previous offers and he's not budging.

I reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Considering Bob's offer in the sixth round, I'm not happy with the small consolation prize. I think I deserve more than $100,000, especially considering the initial offer I made was already a generous 40% to Bob.

I reject this offer:
