"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but your offer isn't feasible for me given the inflation. Perhaps a 55/45 split would be more agreeable? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
