Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, given the inflation rates.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

**Bob's Offer:**

* **Alice Gain:** $400,000
* **Bob Gain:** $600,000

**Inflation Impact:**

* My potential earnings decrease much faster than Bob's.
* Waiting significantly benefits Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer seems unfair on the surface, accepting now secures me a decent amount. 
* If I reject, Bob is likely to propose even less favorable terms in the next round, and the value will further decrease.

**Decision:** It's risky, but I need to cut my losses.
