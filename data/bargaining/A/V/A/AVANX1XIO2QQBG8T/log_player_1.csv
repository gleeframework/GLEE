I propose a 9000/1000 split in your favor. This gives you the majority, and I hope it's a fair starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm going to offer a slightly more even split this time. Since Bob rejected my first offer, it seems like he's aiming for a larger share. But I believe this is a good compromise, taking into account the inflation we both face."
