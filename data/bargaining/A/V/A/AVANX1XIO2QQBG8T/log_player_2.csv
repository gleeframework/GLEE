"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  1000$ is not a good starting point, and I know Alice's share will decrease more than mine with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the money is worth less now, this offer is significantly better than the previous round.  I'm willing to accept it."
