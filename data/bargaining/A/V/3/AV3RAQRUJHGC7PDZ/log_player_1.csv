I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since the money loses value for me each round, I want to get as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious factor. A 6000$ gain now is better than potentially getting less in the next round."
