Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting us both, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56

**Reasoning:**

While Alice acknowledges the impact of inflation, her offer still heavily favors her. Accepting 44% now means losing out on significantly more potential value due to the steep 59.04% inflation impacting my share.  It's worth risking another round to negotiate a more balanced deal."
