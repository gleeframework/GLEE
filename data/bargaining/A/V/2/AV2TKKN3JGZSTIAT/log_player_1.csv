I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the initial offer, but still a significant concession. I'm hoping Bob will find this more appealing than the 50-50 split he suggested earlier."

I think this is a good compromise. The 54-46 split is relatively close to a 50-50 split, and I'm willing to accept it. I've been trying to get a better deal, but it seems like we're getting close to a fair split. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
