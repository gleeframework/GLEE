Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect us both differently. Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
