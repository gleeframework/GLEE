"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering you $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000. It's a fair share, considering I'm the one making the first offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 10% less than the original $700,000, which is $630,000. I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject his offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 10% less than the previous round, which is 630,000 * 0.9 = 567,000. I'll aim to get a bigger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
