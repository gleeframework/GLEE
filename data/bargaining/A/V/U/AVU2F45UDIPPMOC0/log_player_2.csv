Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a little more, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a slightly better deal, the effects of inflation are starting to hurt. Accepting 43 now is the equivalent of accepting around 28-29 in the first round. It's still worth holding out for a better deal, even if it means putting more pressure on later rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""This seems fair considering the time pressure. Let's end this!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting risky. While not ideal, accepting 52% would be much better for Alice. Offering 48% for me is still a reasonable amount considering the first round, but it needs to be balanced with the risk of getting nothing. The message aims to add pressure and highlight the approaching deadline."
