"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, considering the upcoming rounds and potential inflation. Let's go with 55 for me and 45 for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 45 is actually worth 36 (since 45 * 0.8 = 36). Considering the offer, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject the offer and make a counter proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 50, and I'll take 50, but I think I can do better than that. Let's see what happens next.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less than in the second round, so my gain of 50 is actually worth 40 (since 50 * 0.8 = 40). Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think I should get a bigger share too. Let's see if you accept this offer.""
}
```"
