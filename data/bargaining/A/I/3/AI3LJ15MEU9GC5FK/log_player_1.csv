"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with a message encouraging a fair split. Your turn!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split. Let's be fair and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same for me in this round as in the first round, but 10% less for Bob, I can try to negotiate for a better split in the next round. Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4500 and keep $5500 for myself, taking into account that the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each subsequent round. This way, I'm still making a relatively fair offer while also considering the impact of inflation on Bob's gains. Your turn!"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the best deal we can get now, given the inflation. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's message suggesting this is the best deal due to inflation, the fact that the money is worth the same for me in every round but significantly less for Bob in each subsequent round means I can push for an even better split in the next round. The offer of $4000 for me is less than what I previously offered Bob, so I'll hold out for a better deal. Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting you hard; this is a generous offer.""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $3000 and keep $7000 for myself. Given that the money is worth significantly less for Bob in this round (27.1% less than the first round), but remains unchanged for me, I can leverage this to my advantage. The message highlights the impact of inflation on Bob's gains, suggesting that this offer is more generous than it appears at first glance. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to concede a bit more. This is a fair offer given the current situation, let's end it. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's concession, the offer of $3500 for me is still less favorable considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's gains. The fact that the money is worth 40.95% less for Bob but remains unchanged for me means I can continue to negotiate for an even better split. Your turn! {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""Inflation is severely impacting your gains; this is as good as it gets.""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $2500 and keep $7500 for myself. Given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's gains (40.95% less than the first round), I'm in a strong negotiating position. The message emphasizes that this offer is as generous as Bob can expect, considering the circumstances. Your turn!"
