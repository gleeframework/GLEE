"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, but I'll give you a chance to reconsider your initial offer 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of $5000 is actually worth $4500 to me.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split, considering I could have gotten a better deal in the first round. However, I don't want to pass up a guaranteed 50-50 split, especially since it's a fair offer.
