Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting closer to a more even split, but it's still in my best interest to hold out a little longer. The inflation is working in my favor, making her offers less appealing to her with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's split it right down the middle. This is the most sensible option for both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to offer a perfectly even split. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is increasing rapidly.
* **Inflation Advantage:** The inflation is steadily eroding Alice's potential gains, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time passes. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is undeniably fair, and Alice would be hard-pressed to justify rejecting it at this stage without seeming overly greedy."
