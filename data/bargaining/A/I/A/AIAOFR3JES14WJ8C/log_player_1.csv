"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  Since I'm less affected by inflation, I'm willing to give Bob a larger share initially. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with this offer, but I'm willing to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  With the inflation in effect, a 50/50 split isn't fair to me. I'm holding out for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still offering a larger share to Bob, but I'm reducing my offer slightly due to the inflation.  This is a compromise, and I hope he'll see the value in settling now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable to me.  The inflation is hitting him harder, but I still believe I can secure a better deal.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but it's still the most reasonable given the inflation and how much Bob's offer is decreasing. I'm hoping we can reach a compromise before things get worse for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse for me, but I still believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. I'm not giving up just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm continuing to offer a compromise, even though the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to reach a deal. I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair.  I'm still not willing to accept such a small share, especially given the severe inflation. I'm determined to fight for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The inflation is reaching a critical point.  I need to make a more substantial concession to Bob.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping this will finally be acceptable to him."
