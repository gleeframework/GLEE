"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I need to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, and it will continue to decrease in value in each subsequent round. Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}

I'm offering Bob $5,500, and I'll take the remaining $4,500."
