Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. 50/50 isn't ideal with the inflation, so I propose a slight advantage for me this round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
