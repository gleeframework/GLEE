Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equal split is fair. Let's try 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's analyze why this is a good move:

* **Current Offer:** Bob offers me $45 (which is actually worth 10% less due to inflation).
* **My Position:**  While his offer is closer to a 50/50 split, time is on my side.  The longer the game goes on, the more valuable my acceptance becomes to Bob as his potential earnings decrease faster than mine. 
* **Strategy:**  I need to signal that I'm aiming for a better deal while keeping in mind that an agreement is better than nothing if we reach the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Time is money and it's literally costing us both. I'll take a slightly larger share, but this offer ensures you get something decent.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle on a 40/60 split. It's the fairest compromise considering the time we've wasted, and it allows us both to get something. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We are now in Round 4 of 12.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each passing round.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to agree.
* **Acceptable Offer:** While Bob's offer is the same as my initial proposal, the impact of inflation makes it more attractive now. Accepting guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continued negotiation carries significant risk. 
 
It's better to secure a decent amount now than gamble on a potentially better, but riskier, outcome later."
