Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile considering the inflation difference. This offer is a compromise, giving you a slightly larger portion than last round. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000
