Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your rate of loss is higher than mine, Alice. Let's be pragmatic - this offer still leaves you with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000
