Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can find a more equitable split. Let's go for a 55/45 split in my favor.  This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
