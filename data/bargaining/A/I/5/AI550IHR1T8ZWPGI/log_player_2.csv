"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's in your best interest to accept now, as the value decreases faster for me in the next round.

# Alice gain: 60

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but letting this drag on only hurts us both.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it before the money shrinks even further! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
