"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fairer way to divide the money, as I'll be taking on the risk of making the first offer.  Let's get this done before the money loses too much value! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
