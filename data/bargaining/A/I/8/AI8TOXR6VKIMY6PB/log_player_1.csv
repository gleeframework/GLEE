"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to think about whether the 400,000 I'd get is a good deal. I'll reject this offer for now.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now (5% less from the first round, and another 5% less from the second round), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss of value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about whether 350,000 is a good deal. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer this time.
