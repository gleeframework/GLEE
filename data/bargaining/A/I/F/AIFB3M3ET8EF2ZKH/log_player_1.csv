"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, you can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%. My message to Bob is a bit cheeky, implying that this is the best offer he'll get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $50 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $45.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Meeting in the middle seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I get to make the next proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal this time!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the $100, and Bob gets 45%. My message to Bob is a bit of a warning that I'm not going to give him an easy deal this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge this time 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $48 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is approximately $35.62.

I'll consider Bob's offer. A slight edge for me, huh? I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, but I'm not eager to continue negotiating either...
