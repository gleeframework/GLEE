"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to be generous. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

Since Bob's offer is 600,000, that's 60% of the original amount, which is more than my previous offer of 700,000 being 70% of the original amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
