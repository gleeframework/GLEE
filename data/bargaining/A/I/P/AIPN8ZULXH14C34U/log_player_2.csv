"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small share for now, we can negotiate more in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $1,000, knowing about the inflation, it's better to reject and see what Alice proposes in the next round. Even a small increase in my share would be better due to the decreasing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 6000,

""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's get this done and avoid further losses.""
