"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45. Considering the inflation, this is a better deal for you than the previous one. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation pressure, so I'm adjusting my offer slightly. Let's close the deal now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  Each round costs both of us money due to inflation. It's in our best interest to settle quickly.
* **Bob's perspective:** Bob's offer in round 2 was advantageous for him. By round 3, his perceived value of that offer has decreased due to inflation. 
* **Strategic concession:** My offer is a slight concession from my round 1 offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome.  
* **Clear communication:** The message directly addresses the inflation issue and encourages a swift resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, especially on your end, I think this is a fair adjustment. Let's settle. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable trend:** Bob's offer is getting progressively worse for me. He's clearly trying to exploit the inflation disparity to his advantage.
* **Holding my ground:**  While I acknowledge the inflation pressure, accepting this offer would be letting Bob dictate the terms completely. I need to show him I'm willing to risk further inflation to secure a fairer deal.
* **Potential for Bob to concede:**  Bob knows I'm feeling the heat of the inflation. There's a chance he might be getting nervous and could be more receptive to a compromise in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. The inflation is hurting both of us, but it's hitting me harder.  Let's be reasonable and end this here.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time sensitivity is paramount:**  The inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money. Every additional round significantly hurts both players. 
* **Projecting firmness:**  Calling this my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and signals that I'm not willing to be pushed any further.
* **Strategic middle ground:** This offer is a significant concession from my previous stance but still secures a slight advantage for me. It's a compromise designed to be acceptable to Bob while minimizing my potential losses from further inflation. 
* **Appeal to reason:** The message directly acknowledges the shared pain of inflation and encourages Bob to make a rational decision for both our benefits."
