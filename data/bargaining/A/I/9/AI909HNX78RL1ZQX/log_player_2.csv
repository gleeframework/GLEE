Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still feeling generous, but my patience is wearing thin.  This is my last offer before things get really interesting. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but this offer is still much too low. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair share. The penalty from inflation is hurting, but accepting a terrible deal is worse."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop playing games. This is a serious offer.  It's important we both get a decent share before inflation eats away at this deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  I'm willing to take a slight hit to avoid risking losing everything.  It's your call. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is still a terrible deal for me, even with the inflation considered.  Alice is bluffing â€“ she knows that if we reach the last round and I have to propose, I'll be forced to offer her almost everything to avoid getting nothing. I'm going to call her bluff and hope she starts taking me seriously in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This is my last attempt at a fair split. Let's be realistic and end this now before we both lose out.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, Bob.  I'm still willing to compromise, but we're getting dangerously close to the point of no return. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is agonizing, but I have to reject. Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the time limit, but this offer is still unacceptable. Accepting now would mean getting significantly less than even the heavily inflated amount I'd get by proposing a nearly even split in the final round. I have to show I'm willing to go all the way and hope she cracks."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a very reasonable 45%, let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every passing round.  This is my final offer -  take it or lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The pressure is unbearable! With the current inflation, even this low offer is starting to look better than risking it all for a slightly better split in the final round. If I reject and Alice sticks to her strategy, I'll be forced to offer her almost everything in Round 12.  This is a bitter pill to swallow, but it's the safest option at this point."
