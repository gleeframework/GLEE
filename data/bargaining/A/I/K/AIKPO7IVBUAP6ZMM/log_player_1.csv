"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure the money quickly before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something, and I'm not sure how inflation affects Bob.  It's a safer bet than risking another round."
