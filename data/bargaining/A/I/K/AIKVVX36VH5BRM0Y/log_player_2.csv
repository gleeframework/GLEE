"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a classic game theory problem with a focus on bargaining and strategic thinking. While 1000 dollars is better than nothing, it's worth considering that in the next round, Bob can propose a more favorable division. Additionally, the  inflation factor adds an element of risk, making it more beneficial to try and negotiate a better deal."
