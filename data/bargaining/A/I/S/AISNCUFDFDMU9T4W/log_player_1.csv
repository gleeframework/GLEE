"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This way, I'll get 60% of the money, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is a 60% to 40% split, just like my initial offer. However, the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, so I'd be better off accepting this offer. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
