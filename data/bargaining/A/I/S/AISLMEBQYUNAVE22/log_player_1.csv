I'm proposing to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I want to maximize my share in the first round, but I'm also trying to be somewhat fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  I'm worried inflation will make the money I receive less valuable if I reject.  A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
