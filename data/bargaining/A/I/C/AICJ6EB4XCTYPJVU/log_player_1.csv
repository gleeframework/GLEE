"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this fair split and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly suggestion to accept the offer and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. The offer is still quite skewed towards Bob's gain, and I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can sense it. I'm not going to give in yet! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

I'll think carefully about this new offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious.

However, I still think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is getting intense!

Considering the rapid inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""It's now or never, Bob! Don't let the money slip away!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly more favorable split, hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and accept the offer."
