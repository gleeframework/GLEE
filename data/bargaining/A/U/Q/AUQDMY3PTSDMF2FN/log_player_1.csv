It's tempting to accept, but Bob is clearly trying to exploit the time pressure and inflation. Holding out for a better deal is still the best strategy."

``` 

This is a tough one, and very frustrating! However, accepting a 25/75 split would be devastating for Alice, especially considering the inflation. It's a huge gamble, but rejecting and proposing a more reasonable offer in the next round might be the only way to salvage a somewhat fair deal."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 40,
""bob_gain"": 60,
""message"": ""Bob, this is ridiculous! I'm offering you the 60/40 split you wanted initially. Take it before the money is worth nothing to me!""
}
``` 
This is a risky move, as it's a significant concession on Alice's part. However, with time running out, it might be the last chance to secure a deal where she gets a somewhat reasonable share, even if it's heavily impacted by inflation. The urgency in the message emphasizes the need for Bob to accept before it's too late for both of them."
