**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly clinging to getting a significantly larger share, even though the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. While her offer is getting closer to a fair split, accepting now would still give her a significantly larger portion of the diminished total. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."
