"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since the money depreciates for you, and not for Bob, I'm hoping this is a good deal for both of us. Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's clear that Bob is in a very favorable position due to the inflation affecting me.  Accepting this offer is the best way to salvage some of the value for myself."
