"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money, leaving 45% for Bob. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, ending the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair split, but I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself this time. Let's not let the money devalue too much with further delays. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 517500,
  ""bob_gain"": 482500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I've taken into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation and made an offer that splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping this compromise will be more acceptable to Bob."
