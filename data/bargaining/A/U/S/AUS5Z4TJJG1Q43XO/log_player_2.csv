"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split is fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice, especially considering the rapid inflation against my gains.  I'm willing to negotiate, but this starting point is far too low for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be more realistic. This offer recognizes the time pressure and gives us both a chance for a decent share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find that middle ground. This offer still recognizes the time pressure and gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is barely budging!  While she claims to be finding middle ground, a $500 increase on my end is not nearly enough to offset the significant difference in our potential gains and the rapidly increasing inflation working against me.  I need to signal I'm serious about a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating away at the value. This offer is a compromise. It's time to get serious about reaching a deal."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it, but we're running out of time. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is cutting it incredibly close, and I'm not happy about it. However, the inflation is severely impacting my potential gains with each passing round. Accepting a nearly 50/50 split at this point is the least risky option to ensure I walk away with something. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge further."
