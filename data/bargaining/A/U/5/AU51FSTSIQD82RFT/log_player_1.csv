Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise with a 4:1 split, but I think I deserve more considering my potential losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
