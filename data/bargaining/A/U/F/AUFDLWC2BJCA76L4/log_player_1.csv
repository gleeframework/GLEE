"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and equal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is actually worth 40 dollars (80% of 50). 

I'll decide to reject this offer since I can do better than that. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of 60 dollars in the first round is now worth 48 dollars (80% of 60). I'll aim to get a bit more this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, but I need a bit more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

My gain of 60 dollars in the first round is now worth 29.76 dollars (48.8% of 60). 

Considering the offer, I'll get 45 dollars, which is worth 30.24 dollars (80% of 45). That's a bit better than my current value, so I'll accept.
