I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  This is to see if Bob is willing to settle for a small share early on. If he rejects, we'll have to adjust our strategy in the following rounds.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to take a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing at all. The inflation is a serious threat, and I don't want to gamble further."
