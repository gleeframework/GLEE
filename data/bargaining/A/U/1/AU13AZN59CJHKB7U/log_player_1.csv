"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000

```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid the 5% devaluation in the next round!"

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,

With the money worth 36.98% less than in the first round, I'm starting to think that taking what I can get is the best option. Bob's offer is the best one I've seen so far, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value.
