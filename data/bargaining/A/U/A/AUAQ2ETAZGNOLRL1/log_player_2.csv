Round 7
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the shrinking time window. While her offers are getting slightly better, they are still far from a fair split. Holding out longer might force her to propose a more reasonable deal.  We're past the halfway point, but there's still room to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 505000, ""alice_gain"": 495000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  This is a slight edge for me, but ensures we both walk away with a significant sum.  Don't risk it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're entering the late stages of the game.  While I want a slight advantage,  I need to make an offer tempting enough for Alice to accept.  The message is designed to create a sense of urgency and highlight the risk of walking away with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Really, Bob? You think 505k is fair? I'm being generous here 
# Bob gain: 435000 
# Alice gain: 565000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice seems to be getting frustrated, but her offer is still significantly worse than what we've already rejected. She's trying to frame 435,000 as ""generous,"" but it's far from it. With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is on her to propose something acceptable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A final offer: a clean, fair 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but let's not throw away a million dollars.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  With only three rounds remaining, the time for posturing is over.  Offering a 50/50 split minimizes risk. It's clear Alice won't accept anything less than 490,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than 500,000.  This is the most logical choice at this critical juncture."
