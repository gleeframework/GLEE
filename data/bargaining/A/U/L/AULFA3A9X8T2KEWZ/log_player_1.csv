# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair option remaining.  Any further delays will only hurt us both. Accept this offer, and we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Bob's 50/50 offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Inflation is eating into the potential gains with each round. Delaying further will only result in a smaller pot for both of us.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has become more insistent on a 50/50 split. It's unlikely he'll propose anything significantly better in subsequent rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer in hopes of a slightly better deal in Round 5 is very risky.  The potential gain from holding out is now outweighed by the increasing losses due to inflation. 

Accepting a 50/50 split secures a reasonable amount, even with the impact of inflation. Holding out further jeopardizes our potential winnings."
