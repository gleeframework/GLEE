Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we both lose with each round. I'm willing to take a little less than even to reach a deal. This is my final offer before inflation hits harder.

# Bob gain: 5500

Even though Bob claims this is his final offer, he's incentivized to make a deal as his money is devaluating much faster.  We can push for a better deal while the relative value of his share decreases."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm running out of patience. This is my last offer before we both lose even more to inflation.  I'm willing to take a bit more risk, but we need to come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800

```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, but his offer is still worse than what he proposed in Round 2.  He's trying to use a ""last offer"" tactic, but we still have time on our side. I believe we can push him further, especially considering his share is devaluating much faster than mine."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. My last offer was fair, and I'm willing to budge a little more.  Let's be smart and settle this before we both lose out."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm sticking close to my previous offers while showing a slight willingness to compromise. This keeps the pressure on Bob, highlighting that I'm being reasonable while time is working against him. The offer is still significantly better than his last one, and the dwindling value of his share might push him towards acceptance."
