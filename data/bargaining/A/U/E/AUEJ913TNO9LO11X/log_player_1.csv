"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something fair. This offer won't be as good in the next round! 
# Alice gain: 45

Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Come on, let's split the difference!""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the final fair offer. The money shrinks quickly! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince we've finally reached a fair 50/50 split and the value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision to make. It ensures both of us get an equal share without risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
