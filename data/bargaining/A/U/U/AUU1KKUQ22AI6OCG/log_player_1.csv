"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is still $100, but it's worth less due to inflation. Let's calculate the actual value of the money:

My gain: 50
Value of 50 dollars after 10% inflation (5% in the first round + 5% in this round) = 50 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 45.25

Bob's gain: 50
Value of 50 dollars after 20% inflation (10% in the first round + 10% in this round) = 50 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 32

I'll decide based on the actual value of the money. Since I'd be getting 45.25 and Bob would be getting 32, I think this is a good deal for me.
