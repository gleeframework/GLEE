"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Taking into account the inflation, I'll consider the effective values as follows:

My gain in the first round was 30, and now it's worth 19% less, so I'd get 30 * 0.81 = 24.3. 
Alice's gain in the first round was 70, and now it's worth 36% less, so she'd get 70 * 0.64 = 44.8.

Comparing this to Alice's offer, I'd get 45, which is slightly more than my effective gain of 24.3, but less than the effective gain of 44.8 she'd get. Considering this, I'll reject her offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the continued inflation, the money is worth 81% of its value from the first round. 

My previous offer was 40, which is worth 40 * 0.81 = 32.4. I'll make a new offer that's slightly higher, considering the effective values.
