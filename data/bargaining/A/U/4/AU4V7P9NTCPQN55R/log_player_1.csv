"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is a very aggressive offer, but I'm aiming to secure the majority of the money early on, knowing that the value will decrease significantly with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my previous proposal. It's clear that we need to find a more balanced solution. I will reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

This is a revised offer, still aiming for a majority share, but showing some flexibility to reach a potential agreement. I'm reducing my share by 100,000 and increasing Bob's by 100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to secure a larger share, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation and the limited rounds remaining. Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial amount of money, which is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
