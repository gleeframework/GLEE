"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take a large share of the money! ðŸ¤‘  Let's see if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept a lower share of the money, especially since I'm losing more value due to inflation. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to stay ahead of the inflation curve and see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation is hitting hard, it's getting harder for Bob to make an offer that's worth it to him, while giving me a decent share.  I'm going to take this offer before it gets worse!"
