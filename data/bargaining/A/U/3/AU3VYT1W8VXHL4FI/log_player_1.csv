Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60:40 split is a more equitable way to share the money. It's still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the value of my contribution to the game. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
