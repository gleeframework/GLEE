"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 40 is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 60 is now worth 20% less than the 80 I initially proposed, which is 64. However, Bob's gain of 40 is now worth 5% less than the 20 I initially proposed, which is 19.

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my gain, but I think I can do better than 19. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further, but I need a higher share to compensate for inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so it's 20% less than 64, which is 51.60. Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so it's 5% less than 40, which is 38.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50/50 and move forward. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of 50 is worth 48.8% less than the 80 I initially proposed, which is 41.6. Bob's gain of 50 is worth 14.26% less than the 20 I initially proposed, which is 17.14.

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my gain, but I think 50/50 is a fair split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing values. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 50/50 it is. Let's finalize the split.""
}
```"
