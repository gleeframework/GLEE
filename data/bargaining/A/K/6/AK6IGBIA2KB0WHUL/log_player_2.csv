"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 50/50 split still isn't fair given the inflation impact.  Let's try a 75/25 split. This gives you a decent share while acknowledging the changing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000
