"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risks of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation factor heavily favors Bob.  His offer, while seemingly equal, is worth more to him because he's only experiencing a 5% inflation hit, while I'm facing a 20% loss.  Rejecting this offer keeps me in the game and allows me to try to get a more favorable deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but a 50/50 split still isn't fair given the inflation impact.  Let's try a 75/25 split. This gives you a decent share while acknowledging the changing value of the money.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the impact of inflation, but a 75/25 split is still too unbalanced. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but a 45/55 split feels more reasonable given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like a larger share, the inflation rate is working against me significantly.  A 45/55 split in Bob's favor is a decent outcome considering the current inflation rates. Accepting this offer secures a significant amount of money for me, even with the inflation factor. It's better to take what I can get now than risk losing even more with further rounds."
