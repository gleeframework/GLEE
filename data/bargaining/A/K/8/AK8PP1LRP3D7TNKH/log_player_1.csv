Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll get a decent portion.  We can end this here, or we can keep playing and see how this inflation affects things. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
