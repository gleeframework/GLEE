Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 55-45 in my favor.  This way, we can both still get a good amount even with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is working against us both. I'm offering a slightly better deal than before, let's close this out and avoid losing more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing money with each round. I'm willing to go up to 60 for myself, but this is my final offer. Let's get this done before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is getting hit harder by inflation (59.04% loss) than Alice (34.39% loss). Waiting longer significantly hurts Bob's potential gains.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might seem like a good idea, but each round makes the difference in their offers less significant due to the rapid inflation.
* **Alice's Final Offer:** Alice seems firm, and pushing her further might make her less likely to compromise in future rounds. 

Taking $40 now is better than risking getting a much smaller amount, or even nothing, later."
