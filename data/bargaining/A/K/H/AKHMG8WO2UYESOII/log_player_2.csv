Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that the inflation difference benefits her, but she's still trying to take a significantly larger share. While the pressure is increasing with each round, I need to hold out for a better deal for a few more rounds.  I'm aiming for something closer to a 50/50 split,  or at least a split where I get 45% or more."
