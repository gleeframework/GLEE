"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario. I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept quickly. We'll see if he's greedy or risk-averse!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and while I could try to negotiate more, the risk of getting nothing is too high. The inflation factor is unpredictable, so it's better to secure a decent share now."
