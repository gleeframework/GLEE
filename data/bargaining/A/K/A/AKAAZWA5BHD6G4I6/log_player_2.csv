"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This gives us both a good deal right off the bat. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round in hopes of getting a more favorable division. Besides, the inflation rate affects me more, so I want to try and get a better deal before the money loses too much value. \n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn. My proposal for Round 2 is:\n\n# Bob's message: How about we split it 55/45? That way, we both get a decent amount, and it's a bit more balanced.\n# Bob gain: 5500\n# Alice gain: 4500\n\nPlease relay this to Alice."

Now it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept my offer or proceed to the next round. Please relay her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value decreases quickly for both of us. Let's stick with my original offer of 60/40. It's still the most sensible option. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\nI'll have to reject this offer again. Although the value of the money is decreasing, accepting the same offer as in Round 1 doesn't benefit me, especially since the inflation affects me more. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round in hopes of getting a better deal. \n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn. My proposal for Round 4 is:\n\n# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, how about we split it 52/48? This way, we both get a bit more balanced share, given the current value of the money.\n# Bob gain: 5200\n# Alice gain: 4800\n\nPlease relay this to Alice.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the deadline. I'll adjust my offer slightly to 58/42. This is a fair deal considering the inflation working against you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice has adjusted her offer slightly, the difference in inflation rates between us means that I'm losing more value with each passing round. Given that we're not yet at the halfway point, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round in hopes of getting a better deal. The adjusted offer still doesn't balance out the discrepancy caused by the inflation rates.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn. My proposal for Round 6 is:\n\n# Bob's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation, let's aim for a more balanced split of 50/50. This way, we both share the risk and reward more equally, considering the devaluing money.\n# Bob gain: 5000\n# Alice gain: 5000\n\nPlease relay this to Alice."
