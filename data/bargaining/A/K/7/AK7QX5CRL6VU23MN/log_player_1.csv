Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting greedier and clearly hoping I'll crack under the pressure of inflation.  While 14.26% is a significant loss, accepting a deal where I get less than half is a worse outcome. I need to remain firm and hope he starts negotiating more realistically."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to accept a smaller share to end this, but it needs to be reasonable.  Let's close this deal before we both lose even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to show some flexibility.  Offering a deal where Bob gets slightly more but still within a reasonable range might be the key to ending this standoff. He might be more amenable knowing I'm willing to compromise, even if it means accepting a slightly smaller share than initially hoped."
