"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob.  A 55/45 split seems reasonable for us to end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too greedy, Alice.  I'm willing to settle this now with a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking Initiative:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals he's willing to negotiate and isn't going to simply accept an unfair deal. This round, he takes the lead with his own offer.
* **Slight Advantage:**  Bob's offer gives him a slight advantage, acknowledging that time is money (due to inflation for him). 
* **Urgency and Compromise:** The message aims to convey a sense of urgency (""settle this now"") while still suggesting a willingness to compromise (his offer is better than a 50/50 split for Alice compared to what she'll get if she waits).

This strategy attempts to balance assertiveness with a degree of fairness to entice Alice to accept and avoid further rounds where the value diminishes for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The money is losing value Bob, let's be practical. I'll accept a 52.5/47.5 split, but in *my* favor this time. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has cleverly flipped Bob's previous offer back on him. While this offer isn't ideal, consider:

* **Inflation:**  The longer Bob waits, the less his share is worth. Another rejection means risking even less in future rounds.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice seems firm and unlikely to settle for significantly less than a 52.5/47.5 split.  
* **Minimal Losses:** Accepting now means a loss of $25,000 (compared to his initial rejection). Further delays could lead to much larger losses due to inflation.

It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting now cuts potential losses and ensures Bob gets something out of the deal."
