"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split. I'm open to negotiations, but remember, inflation is looming!""}\n\nI'm excited to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer if we split it closer to the middle. This is a better starting point for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I see you want to meet in the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's try this split. Remember, time is money... literally!""}\n\nLet's see how Bob responds this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest option, and we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think it's time to accept the offer and split the money down the middle. With inflation eating away at my potential gains, it's better to secure a fair share now rather than risking further devaluation. Plus, it's a decent share, as Bob said!"
