I'm going to reject this offer. It's not very fair, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to compensate for inflation.  Let's find a solution we can both agree on. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While it's not ideal, the inflation is really starting to hurt."
