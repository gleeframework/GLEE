"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a reasonable starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so my gain of 50 in this round is equivalent to 45 in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to negotiate further. Meeting in the middle might be a good starting point, but I'd like to aim for a better outcome for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that we're 2 rounds in, I'll try to make a stronger offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! With the reduced value of money, my gain of 45 in this round is equivalent to 36.9 in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think it over... I'd rather not give up too much more, but I'm not confident that I can do better. I'll take the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's hope I'm making the right decision!"
