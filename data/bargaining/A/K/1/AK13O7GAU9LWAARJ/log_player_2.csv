"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing almost 60% of the potential value compared to the first round. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. It's worth risking a few more rounds to try and secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. I'm taking a hit with the inflation, this is a compromise to get us both something.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side, don't wait too long! 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me! While this offer is far from ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. Holding out any longer is too risky, as I'll just be left with crumbs."
