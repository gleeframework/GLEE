"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining rounds between us.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share of the initial amount, but I'm willing to give him a chance to accept and potentially negotiate better terms in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly.  Let's start with this, and we can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll evaluate the offer:

In Round 1, I offered Bob $1000, which is now worth 20% less, so it's equivalent to $800 in the current round.
Bob's offer is $1000, which is 5% less than the original $1050 he would have received in the first round.

I think this offer is reasonable, considering the reduced value of money. I'll accept it.
