Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but let's meet in the middle. I propose a 65/35 split. This reflects a more balanced approach while acknowledging the time constraint and the value diminishing with each round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a solution we can both agree on. This offer is a compromise between our previous positions. Let's settle this now and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aiming to secure a significant advantage, and her offer barely budges despite the time pressure. While my potential gains are decreasing, accepting a deal heavily favoring her this early sets a bad precedent. I need to demonstrate I'm willing to risk it for a fairer split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my guns on this one. 48/52 is my final offer.  The clock is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on. Take this offer, and we both walk away with something substantial.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. This split is still slightly in her favor, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but also establishing a firm boundary.  The emphasis on the dwindling time reinforces the urgency of reaching an agreement."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm making a concession, but this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it - we're running out of time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to strong-arm me with that ""final offer"" tactic, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm willing to bet she'll break and offer something better in the next round rather than risk getting nothing at all.  My ""final offer"" from the previous round was a power play, but this close to the deadline, it's more important that I show resolve and willingness to walk away."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want to reach a deal.  Let's stop wasting time with ultimatums.  I'm coming back to my previous offer of 45/55. It's a fair split considering the circumstances.  We're down to the wire, let's be smart and get this done.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're entering the endgame now.  It's time to drop the posturing and aim for a realistic agreement.  By returning to my 45/55 offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but not be exploited.  The emphasis on a ""smart"" decision highlights the risk we both face if we fail to reach a deal."
