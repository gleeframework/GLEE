Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small share.  I figure this might encourage him to accept early and avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a lot less generous than my initial one, and even though the money is worth less now, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a slightly smaller share to Bob than my first offer, but I'm still aiming for a larger portion for myself.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, but if not, I'll adjust my offer accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and while I'm losing value with each round, I'm still not willing to settle for such a small share.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

Inflation is hitting hard, so I'm going to offer a slightly smaller share to Bob this round, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept before we both lose too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and although I'm losing value quickly, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. This offer is simply unacceptable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this round, even though it's still a majority for me. We're both losing a lot of value due to inflation, so I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept and prevent us from getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is now extremely unfavorable. Even though I'm losing a significant amount of value, I'm still not willing to accept such a small share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. It's getting risky, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're getting very close to the deadline, and both of us are losing value rapidly.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option given the circumstances, and hopefully, Bob will realize that we need to come to an agreement soon or we'll both end up with nothing."
