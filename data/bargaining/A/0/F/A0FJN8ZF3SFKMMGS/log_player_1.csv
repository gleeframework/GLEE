"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money while still giving Bob a decent share.  Since I'm the one making the offer, I want to maximize my gains, but I also want to ensure that Bob has some incentive to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer seems enticing at first, it's crucial to consider the inflation.  The $100,000 I would gain is worth significantly less than the $900,000 I was offered in round 1.  I will reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to secure a larger portion of the remaining money, even though I'm losing value due to inflation.  This offer still leaves Bob with a significant share, but it brings me closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly, this offer is still the best option for me in this round. Given the inflation, the $400,000 I'll gain is worth more than what I was offered in the previous round, and I'm getting closer to the end of the game.  It's time to accept and secure my share."
