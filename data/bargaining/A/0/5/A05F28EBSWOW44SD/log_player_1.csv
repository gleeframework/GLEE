"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll get $6,000 in value, but it's actually $7,000 in nominal terms. Still, I think this is a good deal for me, so I'll accept.
