"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly biased offer.  I believe this is a good start, and I'm open to negotiation! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a fair starting point, I'm not sure I like the bias towards Alice. I'll see if I can do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split this a bit more evenly. I think this is a fair starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give up some of my gain from the first round, but I still believe this is a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer an even split, this offer is more reasonable than the previous rounds, and the inflation is starting to bite. Let's take it."
