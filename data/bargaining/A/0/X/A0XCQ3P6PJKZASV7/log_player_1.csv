"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point considering the inflation rates are higher for Bob. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best option. My money is worth less, and the next round will be even worse for me."
