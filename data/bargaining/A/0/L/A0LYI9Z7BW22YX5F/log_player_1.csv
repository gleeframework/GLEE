"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'm reasonable!""}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm trying to make a fair and reasonable offer, hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the compromise, but I'll consider it.

Since my gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $4,000, which is less than my initial offer of $8,000.

However, Bob's gain of $6,000 is a significant increase from his initial offer of $2,000.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
