Round 3

Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm willing to go down to 70/30 in my favor, but I think we can both do better if we keep negotiating.  Let's see if we can find a split that works for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is working against me faster than it is against her. Accepting 30% now is significantly less appealing than potentially securing a 40% or even 50% split in the next few rounds. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away to get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about getting a fair deal. 55/45 is my bottom line.  The value of this money is dropping fast, and I'm willing to risk it all for a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This offer represents a significant concession on my part, moving closer to a 50/50 split. However, the strong message attached, indicating this is a non-negotiable offer, might push Alice to accept. It's a calculated risk, as time is a factor, but the potential reward of securing a larger share is worth the gamble."
