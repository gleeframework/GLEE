"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable this time.  I'm willing to split the money 60/40.  This way we both get a good share, and we don't have to waste time with more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
