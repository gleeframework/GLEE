"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept a deal where I get only 25%!  Let's see what Alice will propose next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'll offer Alice a fair deal: 60 for me, and 40 for her. It's a good starting point, and we can negotiate further if she doesn't accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

With the inflation, I'm not sure how many more rounds we have left. A 50/50 split is a fair deal, and I'm happy to take it."
