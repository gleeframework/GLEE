"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me a bigger share, but still a generous offer considering we're dividing $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my gain of 50 is actually $45.

I'm not too thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I suppose it's a fair deal. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
