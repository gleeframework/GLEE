Round 3

# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger bite out of my potential earnings, I'll try to be more cautious and aim for a higher share. However, Alice's offer is relatively close to the initial split, and I don't want to risk going too low. I'll accept this offer.
