Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'll take 80% and you get 20%.  It's a better deal for you than the last round, and closer to my original offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better than her first one, the continuous inflation puts Bob at a significant disadvantage. Accepting now would still mean a substantial loss compared to what Bob could have gained in the first round.  It's worth risking another round to negotiate a fairer deal."

{

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. I'm taking a bigger loss than you with each round, so this is a better deal for you.  Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The relentless inflation means Bob is running out of time. While not ideal, Alice's offer of a 60/40 split is better than anything she has proposed so far. Accepting now secures a decent sum for Bob, whereas continuing the game risks a much smaller gain as the value of the money continues to plummet for him."
