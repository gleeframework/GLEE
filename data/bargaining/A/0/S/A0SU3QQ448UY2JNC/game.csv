999000.0,1000.0,"Let's start fair, I'll take 99.9% and leave you with 0.1%, that seems like a good deal, right?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1000.0,999000.0,"I'm pretty sure you can do better than that, Alice.  Let's split it 99.9% to me and 0.1% to you. Seems fair, right?",Bob,2,

980000.0,20000.0,"Alright, Bob, I'm getting tired of this game. Here's a compromise. I'm taking 98% and leaving you with 2%. It's a lot better than what you're offering, and we can finally end this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
20000.0,980000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you 2% and taking the rest. It's a fair deal considering inflation. Accept this and let's end this game.",Bob,6,
