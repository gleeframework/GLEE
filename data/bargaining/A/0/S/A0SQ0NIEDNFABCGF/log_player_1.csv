"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll try to negotiate for a better deal. The money is worth less now, so I want to get a bigger share to compensate for the reduced value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the reduced value of money, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to get a bit more for myself while still leaving Bob with a reasonable amount."
