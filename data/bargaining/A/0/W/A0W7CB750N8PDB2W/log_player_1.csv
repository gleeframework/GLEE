"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'd rather get more now to make up for the loss in value. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to get a fair deal before the value of the money drops further."
