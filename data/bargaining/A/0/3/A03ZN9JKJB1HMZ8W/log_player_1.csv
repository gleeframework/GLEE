"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 90% of the money and give Bob 10%. Since this is the first round, the value of the money is still the same for both of us. I'm aiming to get as much as possible in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering me much less than I proposed in the first round. While the money is worth less due to inflation, it's still not worth accepting this offer.  I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money. While the money is worth less now, I'm still aiming for a larger share. This seems like a fair compromise considering Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still much lower than what I'd like to receive. Even though the money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a low share. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the money.  While the money is worth less now, I'm still aiming for a larger share than Bob offered.  I'm trying to find a balance between getting a fair share and avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I would like, despite the significant inflation. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money.  The inflation is hitting hard now, but I still need a decent share.  This offer is closer to Bob's previous proposal, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the value of the money has been significantly reduced by inflation, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired share. With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer will ensure I get something, while further rejection could lead to both of us getting nothing."
