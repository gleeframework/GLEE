**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and with each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me. I need to strike a balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing a deal before the effects of inflation become too detrimental.  

This offer:

* **Is still tilted in my favor:** It reflects the urgency of the situation while still aiming for a larger share.
* **Conveys a sense of finality:** This might compel Alice to accept rather than risk getting an even less favorable deal in a later round (if it gets that far)."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action at this point to salvage a reasonable portion of the initial sum. 

Here's why:

* **Further delays hurt me more:** Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller net gain, even if I manage to secure a slightly better split in a future round. 
* **Alice knows I'm desperate:** Her message and the decreasing offer indicate she's aware of my dwindling position and is unlikely to make further concessions.

It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting now cuts my losses and ends the game."
