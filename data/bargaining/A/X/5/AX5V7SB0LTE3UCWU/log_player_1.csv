"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and I initially offered 60, I would have gotten $60 * 0.95 = $57 in the first round. So, in the second round, I'm being offered $40, which is less than what I initially proposed.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. In the second round, I would have gotten $40 * 0.95 = $38. So, in the third round, I'll offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

This way, I get a slightly larger share than in the previous round, while still being cautious."
