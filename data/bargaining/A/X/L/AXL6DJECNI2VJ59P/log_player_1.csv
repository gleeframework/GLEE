"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can negotiate more later""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting that we can discuss and adjust the split later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better, I'm willing to split it more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my effective gain would be 48 (60 * 0.8) if I accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round. I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% inflation again, the money is worth 64% of its original value (0.8^2 = 0.64). I'll make a new proposal that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something in return""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm also signaling that I'm not willing to give up too much."
