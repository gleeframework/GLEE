"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal divides the money equally, considering the risk of inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's proposal seems fair in the first round, it's crucial to consider the impact of inflation. In the following rounds, the value of the money will significantly decrease for both of us.  Since I stand to lose more with each passing round, I need to try to secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This accounts for the greater inflation rate you face in future rounds, while still offering you a substantial share.""}
