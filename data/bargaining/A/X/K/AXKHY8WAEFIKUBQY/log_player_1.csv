"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k and take 600k for myself. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness. How about we split it equally? 500k each. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think an equal split is the best option for me, considering the initial offer was already a 60-40 split in my favor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slight edge. 55-45 split is a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a bit more generous than the initial 60-40 split. Your turn, Bob!"
