"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This offer gives me the vast majority of the money, leaving Bob with a token amount.  I'm hoping this will be enough to tempt him into accepting, especially considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome, especially given the risk of further inflation in future rounds."
