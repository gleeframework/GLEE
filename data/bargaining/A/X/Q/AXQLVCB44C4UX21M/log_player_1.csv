Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair deal. Let's make it quick, the value of the money will only decrease with each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this is a fair deal for me. I'm getting 40% of the money, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer of 60%. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
