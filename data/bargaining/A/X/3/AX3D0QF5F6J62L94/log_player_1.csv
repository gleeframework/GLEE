"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money, my gain of $7,000 is now worth 70% of the original $10,000, and Bob's gain of $3,000 is worth 30% of the original $10,000.

I accept this offer.
