"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is terrible for Bob.  While it's better than nothing, Bob should definitely reject this and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 

This is a pretty aggressive offer. It aims to secure most of the money for Bob while still offering Alice something.  It is a gamble, as Alice might reject it, but it's better than accepting the previous offer. The next rounds will have a smaller pool due to inflation, so it's important to secure a large amount for Bob in the beginning."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55000 
# Alice gain: 945000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is still very unfavorable to Bob. While Alice's offer has improved slightly, it's still far below what Bob could potentially secure with his own proposal. It's important to keep rejecting these offers and maintain leverage for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
```

Bob is still taking a gamble here, but it's important to maintain a strong position. This offer is more balanced than the previous round, giving Alice a larger share, but still securing the majority for Bob.  Alice may be more inclined to accept this offer, as the remaining rounds will see the money shrinking due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 107500 
# Alice gain: 892500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is still not good for Bob, and the inflation is starting to hurt.  While it's tempting to take something,  the next round will be worse. Bob needs to keep pushing for a better deal.  The remaining rounds are getting shorter, so it's crucial to make a strong move soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

Bob is taking a risk here. He is offering Alice a larger portion than before, but it is still significantly less than what Bob is asking for. This offer is a compromise and a risky move, but it is a necessary one. The money is shrinking, and Bob needs to secure a good deal while still being open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 157750 
# Alice gain: 842250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is still bad, but it's getting close to the point where Bob needs to consider accepting something. The inflation is hitting hard, and the remaining rounds are getting shorter. While it's tempting to take what's offered, Bob needs to push one more round to see if Alice will compromise further. If she rejects this offer, Bob will be forced to accept a very low amount in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

This offer is a significant concession from Bob's previous proposal, acknowledging the pressure of inflation and the dwindling number of rounds.  Offering Alice a larger share gives a better chance of her accepting.  It's a risky move but a calculated one to avoid a disastrous outcome in the later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 206125 
# Alice gain: 793875 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

The inflation is extremely high now, and it's clear that the remaining rounds will be disastrous for Bob's potential gains.  While this offer is still not ideal, accepting it is the best option to avoid getting nothing at all. The time for negotiating is over, and accepting this offer ensures at least some return for Bob."
