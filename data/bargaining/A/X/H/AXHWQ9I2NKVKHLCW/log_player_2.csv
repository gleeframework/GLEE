Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Considering the 10% inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share is now worth even less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Alice's offer is still a 45/55 split, which is closer to 50/50 than my previous offer. I'll think about it...

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal, considering the increasing inflation. I'll aim for a larger share, but not too large, to leave some room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. Alice's offer is still a 40/60 split, which is not bad, but I was hoping to get a better deal considering the decreasing value of money.

However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with an even lower potential gain. I'll take this offer.
