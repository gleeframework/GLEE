"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. The message is a friendly introduction to the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 seems like a good start, what do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer, I think 50/50 is a bit too generous for me, given the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50/50 is fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a different split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking a toll! The money is now worth 40% of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. But I think I deserve a bit more, given the initial proposal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. The message is a gentle reminder that I'm trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but I think a 60/40 split is a fair compromise given the current situation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value!

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 60/40 split is still a bit too generous for me, given the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a different split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic about the inflation. I think this split is more in line with the current situation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. The message is a reminder that I'm trying to adapt to the changing circumstances."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting your side hard. I'm being generous with this offer, but I think it's time to be realistic about the situation.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really decimating the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I need to be realistic about the situation. $3,000 is a relatively small amount, considering the original $10,000. I'd rather take what I can get at this point. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think it's time to cut our losses. I'll accept your offer.""
}
```"
