"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking its toll, I need to be more cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that's slightly more in my favor. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is quite close to what I proposed in round 3, and I don't want to risk waiting for a worse offer. I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
