"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's settle!""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, where I get 700,000 and Bob gets 300,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Bob's proposal is a 50-50 split, which is a significant compromise. I think I can live with that.
