"Round 1

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going for a large chunk of the money, hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid the risk of inflation. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, but I'm not going to be bullied into accepting this unfair offer.  I'll take my chances with inflation and make my own offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but still keeping a large share. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse, and the inflation is really starting to bite. I won't accept this unfair deal, I'll take my chances and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal than Bob is offering. This offer is a significant concession from my previous one, but I believe it's still fair.  Hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unreasonable. The inflation is hurting me badly, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of. I'll make my own offer in the next round and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

This is a risky move, given how much the inflation is hurting me. But I believe Bob is starting to feel the pinch too. He's been getting more and more aggressive with his offers. I'm hoping this offer will finally make him realize that we need to compromise to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insulting.  He's clearly taking advantage of the inflation, trying to squeeze every last cent out of me. I'm not going to give in. I'll make my own offer in the next round.  This isn't over yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is my final stand. I've taken a huge hit from inflation, but I'm not going to let Bob take everything. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. I hope Bob will finally see reason."
