"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that I should accept an offer where I get only $70, considering I was initially looking for a more equal split. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50""}

I'm proposing a more equal split this time, with each of us getting $50."
