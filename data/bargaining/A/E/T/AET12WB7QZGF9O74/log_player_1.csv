"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal.

I'm not sure I like the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as motivated to get a larger share as I was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round due to inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, hoping to get a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive in his demands!

Considering the significant inflation, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 70/30 split. The money is worth a lot less than it was in the first round, and I'm not sure I want to give up such a large share.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking a bigger cut! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more confident in his demands!

Considering the significant inflation, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 80/20 split. The money is worth a lot less than it was in the first round, and I'm starting to feel the pinch. However, I'm not sure I want to risk going to the next round, as the money will be worth even less.

I'll reject this offer, but I'm getting close to accepting a bad deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I'm running out of options. I'll make a final offer, hoping Bob will accept it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm proposing a 25/75 split, trying to salvage what's left of the original amount. This is my last chance to get a decent deal, so I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
