"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in the first round was 60-40, and now that the money is worth 5% less, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Bob's offer of 45-55 is still a bit too close to the original 40-60 split, so I'll reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer in the first round was 60-40, and in the second round, I would have accepted a 50-50 split if it were possible. Since Bob's offer was 45-55, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means my offer of 55-45 in round 3 is equivalent to a 47.65-52.35 split in the current round. Bob's offer of 50-50 is a better deal for me, so I'll accept it.
