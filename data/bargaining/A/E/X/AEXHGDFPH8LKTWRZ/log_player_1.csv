"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. I'm framing this as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will be willing to accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, I'll take the majority this time 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to be so aggressive!

Considering the inflation, the effective value of the money is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'd be getting 95,000$ (100,000 * 0.95) and Bob would get 855,000$ (900,000 * 0.95).

I'm not happy with this offer, but I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject it. If I reject it, I'll have to make a new offer in the next round, and the value of the money will decrease further.

For now, I'll reject the offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 90.25% of its original value (95% * 95%) due to the 5% inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. I'm hoping this offer is more acceptable to Bob, and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'll give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating away at the value of the money!

In Round 4, the money is worth 85.71% of its original value (90.25% * 95% * 0.95). So, the effective value of the money is now worth even less.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting 128,500$ (150,000 * 0.855) and Bob would get 723,500$ (850,000 * 0.855).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm starting to get worried that if I reject it, the value of the money will continue to decrease, and I might end up with nothing. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject it.

For now, I'll reject the offer.

I'm offering Bob 580,000$ and keeping 420,000$ for myself. I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, but still hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
