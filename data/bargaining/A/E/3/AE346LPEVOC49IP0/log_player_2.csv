"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a good starting point, but I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think it's time to switch things up. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  Let's see if you're willing to be more flexible."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers. This deal is a good compromise considering the inflation and limited rounds."
