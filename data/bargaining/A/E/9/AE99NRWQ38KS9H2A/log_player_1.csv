"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not feeling as generous as you, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 95/5.  Accept this and we're done, otherwise we're both going to lose money. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
