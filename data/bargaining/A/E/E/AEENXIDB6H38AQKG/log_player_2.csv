I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept getting only $10. Let's see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
```

I'm taking a gamble here. I'm hoping that Alice will realize that if she keeps rejecting, the money will be worth less and less to me, and she'll be getting a smaller and smaller share in the end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even though the money is worth less for me, I still think I can do better than $20. I'll try to push for more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Round 6

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I'm going to stick with my strategy. I'm hoping that Alice will realize that the longer she waits, the less money she'll get in the end.  This is my best chance to secure a significant portion of the money."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
