"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  This is a good starting point for us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how this plays out. While not ideal, I'm willing to see what kind of offers come up in later rounds as the inflation heavily impacts Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is more reasonable given the circumstances. Let's not waste time.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:**  Alice's initial offer was heavily in her favor.  I'm countering with an offer that heavily favors Bob to put pressure on her. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Highlighting the time pressure (due to inflation) is a tactic to make Alice consider accepting a less favorable deal now rather than risking even less later. 
* **Appearing Decisive:**  The message aims to portray Bob as a decisive and rational player, which might influence Alice's future offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We're both losing money with each round, so let's be reasonable and move forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is heavily impacting both players, but especially Alice. While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal in Round 1, it's becoming increasingly reasonable as time goes on.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Waiting for a potentially better offer in later rounds carries a significant risk. The longer the game goes on, the less money there is to be gained for both of us.
* **Fairness:** Alice's offer is objectively fair now. Accepting reinforces that I am also reasonable and willing to compromise when presented with a balanced offer."
