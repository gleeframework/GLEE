750000.0,250000.0,Let's divide the money in a 3:1 ratio. I'll take 750000 and you'll take 250000. It's a fair deal considering the value loss in future rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable offer considering the current value of the money.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 3:2 ratio. I'll take 600000 and you'll take 400000. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for the decreasing value of money in future rounds.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"I'm trying to maximize my share, but I'm willing to give you a small amount to avoid going to the next round with even less value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Given the decreasing value of money, I believe it's fair for us to split the remaining amount equally. This ensures both of us receive a substantial share without risking further reduction in value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50000.0,950000.0,"I'm trying to get as much as possible, but I'm willing to give you a tiny fraction to avoid the worst-case scenario in the next round.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Considering the diminishing value of money, I propose we divide the remaining amount in a 4.5:5.5 ratio. This offers a reasonable compromise while still providing a significant portion to both parties.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
10000.0,990000.0,"I'm taking a risk, but I think it's worth it to try to get the majority of the remaining value.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
400000.0,600000.0,I suggest we divide the remaining amount in a 4:6 ratio. This maintains a fair balance while recognizing the increased risk in future rounds. I believe this is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.,Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1000.0,999000.0,"I'm taking a huge risk, but I think it's worth it to try to get as much as possible with the little time left.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Considering the rapidly decreasing value of money, I propose dividing the remaining amount in a 3.5:6.5 ratio. This aims to provide a fair share while being mindful of the diminishing returns in future rounds.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
100.0,999900.0,"I'm going all in, I'll give you almost nothing, but I want to maximize my share in the last round.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,accept
