I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor.  I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping to avoid too many rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm proposing a 50/50 split this round.  Bob's offer was too unfavorable to me, and with inflation impacting both of us, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward."
