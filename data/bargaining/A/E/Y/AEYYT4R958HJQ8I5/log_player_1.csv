I'm proposing a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob.  I'm aiming for a large share, but I want to ensure Bob has some incentive to accept in the early rounds. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm down 20% in value, Bob is only down 5% so this is a terrible deal for me. I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit, but still offering Bob a significant amount.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground while inflation is still relatively low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Even with the inflation, I'm still worth more than double what Bob is offering.  I'm hoping to find a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to lower my share again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  With inflation increasing, I need to ensure I get a decent share while there's still something left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm dropping my share again, but still aiming for a substantial amount. Inflation is getting serious, so I need to secure a large portion while it's still possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While inflation has hit me hard, it hasn't affected me as much as it has affected Bob. I can still hold out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're both getting hammered by inflation, and I'm not sure how much longer we can hold out.  I'm offering an even split, a 50/50 proposition. It's the best we can do at this point."
