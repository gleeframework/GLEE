"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about a 60/40 split.  Let's try 60/40 for me, since I get to propose first this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Bob is trying to flip the script and propose a 60-40 split in his favor. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast, Bob! I'm not giving you the upper hand. Let's try again.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping for a fair deal. Your turn again!""
}
```

I've reduced the amount I'm willing to give up to 45, while still trying to keep a decent share for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 70/30 split, with me getting the larger share since inflation is starting to affect my earnings.  We need to find a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is starting to bite! Bob's proposal is getting more aggressive, and the 70-30 split is quite lopsided.

I'm not comfortable with giving up such a large share, especially with inflation eroding my potential earnings. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a more balanced deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a chance, Bob! I'm not willing to give up that much. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A 50/50 split seems fair, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more balanced deal. I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in this and agree to it."
