Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm feeling the inflation pinch already.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The tables have turned, Bob. Inflation is working against you. I suggest you take this offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's end this.  This offer is still good for you, and I need to stop this inflation rollercoaster.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before you lose even more to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Pie:**  The value of Bob's potential gain is rapidly decreasing. He's already losing over 34% per round.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice is clearly willing to push this to later rounds, knowing Bob is getting hurt more by inflation.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in the future. She may even offer less, trying to capitalize on Bob's desperation. 

While not ideal, accepting 350,000 (which is worth significantly less than it was in Round 1) is better than risking a worse offer later."
