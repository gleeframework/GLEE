"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both enjoy a nice dinner on me!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can seal the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way we both get a good share and avoid the risk of inflation eating away our earnings in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was hoping Bob would accept the first offer, but I guess I'll have to play it safe now.

Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain in round 2 is worth 90% of the original amount, so I need to be cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value now, I'll aim to get a bigger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too cautious, Bob! Take a chance and trust me on this one!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! My potential gains are decreasing rapidly.

Considering the offer, I'll calculate the effective value of the money I'd gain in round 4, taking into account the cumulative inflation. The money I gain in round 4 is worth 73.1% of the original amount (1 - 0.271).

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is getting worse! My potential gains are dwindling fast.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to make up for the lost value due to inflation!""
}
```"
