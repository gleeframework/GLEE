"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message to Bob is a simple ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!"""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the 70-30 split, but I think it's a decent compromise. My gain would be $300,000, which is worth 80% of the original $375,000 I would have gotten in the first round (due to the 20% inflation). That's not bad, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can do.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the second round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking again.

Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to meet him halfway, but with a slight adjustment to account for the inflation. I'll offer a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous 60-40 split, but still reasonable considering the circumstances.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet you in the middle, with a slight edge for me""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the edge you want, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the 48.8% reduction, my gain is worth only about 51.2% of the original $600,000 I would have gotten in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the 45-55 split, but I think it's a decent compromise. My gain would be $450,000, which is worth about 60% of the original $600,000 I would have gotten in the first round (due to the 48.8% inflation). That's a decent recovery from the previous round's inflation.

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even more inflation.
