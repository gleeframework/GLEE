"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I take 60% and you take 40%.  This way we both benefit from getting something now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, taking into account that the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round. I'll also try to convey a sense of fairness and cooperation in my message to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Alice. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 40%. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can end this game early to avoid further loss due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see you're aiming higher. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still need a larger share to account for the inflation affecting my gains. This offer is a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer because Alice's proposed division still gives her a larger share, and the inflation penalty is affecting her gains more significantly. Since my gain is not affected by inflation, I can afford to wait and try to negotiate for an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's gains. I'll try to balance my desire for a larger share with the need to end the game before the inflation penalty becomes too severe.

{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation is affecting your share more with each round, I think it's only fair that I get a slightly larger portion. However, I'm still willing to compromise to ensure we both get something. Let's end this game soon to minimize our losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  I'm offering a perfectly even split.  This is the fairest deal and avoids further losses for both of us due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer because an even split is a fair deal, and further negotiations may lead to Alice becoming more desperate due to the increasing inflation penalty, but there's also a risk that she might become less willing to compromise. Given that my gains are not affected by inflation, an even split is a reasonable outcome.
