"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $900,000 is now worth $720,000.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'd get $400,000 and Bob would get $600,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think Bob is being generous at all, and I'm not ready to accept such a low offer. I'll try to do better next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, my gain from round 1 is now worth $576,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of me, Bob! Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, with me getting 70% of the remaining $800,000 (after inflation) and Bob getting 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too generous, let's get closer to 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less, my gain from round 1 is now worth $460,800.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'd get $450,000 and Bob would get $550,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is trying to get closer to 50/50, and I think he's still trying to take advantage of me. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 48.8% less again, my gain from round 1 is now worth $241,664 (approximately).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any more generous, Bob. I'll meet you halfway, but no further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a more even split, with me getting 60% of the remaining $800,000 (after inflation) and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a little less, but I'm still not going to give up on getting the majority! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 67.23% less, my gain from round 1 is now worth $146,592 (approximately).

Considering Bob's proposal, I'd get $300,000 and Bob would get $700,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, especially since my gain is already worth significantly less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 67.23% less again, my gain from round 1 is now worth $74,118 (approximately).

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""It's getting late, Bob. Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair considering the value of the money has decreased so significantly due to inflation."
