"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further rounds and any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous offer, I'm still going to reject it. There are still 10 rounds left, and I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable distribution, and hopefully, Bob will accept to avoid further rounds and potential inflation."
