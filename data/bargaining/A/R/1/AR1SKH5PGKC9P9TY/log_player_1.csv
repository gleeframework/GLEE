"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and simple way to divide the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as I'd like to get a bit more than 60. However, it's a decent chunk, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a lower value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
