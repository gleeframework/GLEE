"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $500,000 in the second round is worth only 80% of $800,000, which is $640,000. Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 90% of $200,000, which is $180,000.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000
}

This way, I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 in the fourth round is worth only 60% of $800,000 (from the first round), which is $480,000. Bob's gain of $400,000 is worth 60% of $200,000 (from the first round), which is $120,000.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than my previous one and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with even lower values.
