"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is $20. I'll get the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to decide based on the relative values.

In this round, I'll gain $70, which is 70% of the new value of the money (80% of the original 100$, adjusted for inflation). For Bob, he's offering $30, which is 30% of the new value of the money (90% of the original 100$, adjusted for inflation).

I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a decent share. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, compared to the previous round. I'm offering Bob 40% of the new value of the money, which is $40. I'll get the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values:

In this round, the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, compared to the first round. The original $100 is now worth $51.2 for me and $72.9 for Bob.

I'll gain $55, which is 107.84% of the new value of the money (51.2% of the original 100$, adjusted for inflation). For Bob, he's offering $45, which is 62.04% of the new value of the money (72.9% of the original 100$, adjusted for inflation).

This offer is getting closer, but I'm still not sure if I should accept. I'll reject the offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and end this game already!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end the game."
