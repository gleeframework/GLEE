"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This seems fair given the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in your favor. This acknowledges the diminishing value of your share in the future rounds, while still being a fair deal for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
