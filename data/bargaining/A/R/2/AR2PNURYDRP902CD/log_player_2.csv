"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This seems fair given the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the diminishing value of money for her. It's worth trying to negotiate a better split in the next round, especially since the offer is skewed so heavily in her favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
