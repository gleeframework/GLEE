"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be rational""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'll take $600,000. I've included the message ""Let's be rational"" to appeal to Bob's logical side and encourage him to accept this reasonable offer, avoiding further rounds and the devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be rational, but that offer isn't fair to me. How about we split things a little more evenly? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer of a 45/55 split is still not favorable to me, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since we're only in Round 2, I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try and get a more even split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI've decided to offer Bob $450,000 and take $550,000 for myself. Given that we're in Round 3 and the money is worth 20% less than in Round 1, I'm hoping Bob will see the value in compromising and accept this offer. My message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept this proposal, which is closer to an even split than my initial offer."
