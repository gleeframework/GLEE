Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. This way we both get a good share and avoid risking the value of the money decreasing in further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
