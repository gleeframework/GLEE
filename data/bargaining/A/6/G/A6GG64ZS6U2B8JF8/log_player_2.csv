"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm greedy!  While 400,000 is a lot of money, I want more.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to be bold and try to get a bigger share, but I'm keeping it fair.  600,000 for me, 400,000 for Alice. Let's see if she bites!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still want more, Alice has a point.  She's getting less due to inflation, and I'm not. 460,000 is still a very good amount, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if she rejects my offer again."
