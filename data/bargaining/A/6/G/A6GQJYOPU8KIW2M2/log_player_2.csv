"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice's next offer is.  While 4000$ is a decent starting point, I think I can get a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal.  Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us.  I need a bit more than your last offer to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing quickly.  Taking 3600 is better than risking getting nothing at all."
