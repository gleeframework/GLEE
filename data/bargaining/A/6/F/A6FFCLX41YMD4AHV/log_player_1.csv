"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 and take 60. What do you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip that deal. I'll take 60 and you get 40. This is the only way to ensure the money gets split fairly since it's losing value for you faster than me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

I'm not convinced by Bob's argument that this is the only way to split fairly, considering the inflation factor. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that flipping the deal is the only fair solution. I'd like to propose a different split in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll try to propose a more favorable split for myself this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a 50/50 split, but I'll throw in a bonus of 5 extra dollars for myself to account for the inflation. What do you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
