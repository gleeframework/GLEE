9000.0,1000.0,Let's split the money fairly. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can both be happy with that!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fairer. This way we both get a decent amount, and we don't need to keep playing this game.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45. This is a fairer split than your last offer and still allows both of us to walk away with a significant amount.,Alice,3,
