Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45. This is a fairer split than your last offer and still allows both of us to walk away with a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
