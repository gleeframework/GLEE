"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll take the risk of negotiating further if you don't like it""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. My message is a gentle nudge to see if he's willing to accept a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a slight improvement from my original offer, I think I can do better. The current offer is still heavily skewed in Bob's favor, and I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make an offer again. Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive move:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not backing down further""
}
```

My message is a clear indication that I'm not willing to give in too much, but I'm trying to be somewhat reasonable and meet Bob halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle this time!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, $500,000 is a decent amount, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to call it a day and split the remaining money 50-50."
