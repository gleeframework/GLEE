"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original amount, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll need to adjust my calculation.

For me, $5000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4500 in the first round.
For Bob, $5000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

Considering the original offer I made in round 1, I got 6000 and Bob got 4000. This new offer is not as favorable to me, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer. To make it more appealing to Bob, I'll offer him a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent amounts in the first round:

For me, $4000 is worth 1 / 0.271 = 3.69 times more than in the first round, so it's equivalent to $14700 in the first round.
For Bob, $6000 is worth 1 / 0.488 = 2.05 times more than in the first round, so it's equivalent to $20500 in the first round.

Considering the original offer I made in round 1, I got 6000 and Bob got 4000. This new offer is not as favorable to me, but I'll accept it since it's better than the original offer and I'm running out of rounds.
