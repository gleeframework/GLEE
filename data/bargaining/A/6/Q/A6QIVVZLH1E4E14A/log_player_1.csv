"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering to give Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. This leaves me with $6,000, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for Bob. This way, I'll still get a decent amount, and we can end the game.
