75.0,25.0,I propose we divide the money in a 3:1 ratio. This ensures a fair distribution while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I believe a more even split is fairer, given the decreasing value of money. Let's share it closer to 55/45, reflecting a more equitable distribution.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Considering the inflation and aiming for a balance, I suggest dividing the funds in a 60/40 ratio. This maintains a significant difference in our gains but still acknowledges the decreasing value of money.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's split the remaining money evenly.  With inflation continuing, it makes sense to secure a fair and equal share for both of us.",Bob,4,
