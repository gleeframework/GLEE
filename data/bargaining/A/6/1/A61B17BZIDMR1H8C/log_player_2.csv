**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently offering deals where she gets significantly more. While her offers are getting smaller, the effect of inflation is working more strongly in our favor. We need to hold out for a more balanced deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is it. A perfectly even split. Take it before inflation eats away at your share any further.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push for a 50/50 split. The longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for Alice.  This offer is fair and gives her a final chance to get a reasonable share."
