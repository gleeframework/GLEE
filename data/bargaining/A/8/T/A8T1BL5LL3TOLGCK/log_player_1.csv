"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in your favor. This allows for a comfortable starting point and leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly to 850,000 for me and 150,000 for Bob.  This reflects the inflation, but still leaves a significant share for Bob. I believe this is a fair offer that recognizes our respective losses from inflation while still providing a substantial gain for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While this offer is significantly lower than my initial goal, accepting it is the best strategy at this point.  The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and further rejection risks losing all of it.  I'll accept this offer to secure at least some gain."
