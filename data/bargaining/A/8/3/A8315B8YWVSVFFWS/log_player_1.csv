"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! I'm generous!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a taunt to see if Bob will accept or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, considering the initial offer was too skewed 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the initial offer was indeed skewed, and the money is worth less now, I'll consider this a more reasonable proposal.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
