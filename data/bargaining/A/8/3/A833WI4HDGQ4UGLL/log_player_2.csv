"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40 dollars, I'll take 60.  We can work from there. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. I'm offering you 40, and I'll take 60. Let's see if we can reach a deal this round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'll take 55, and you can have 45.  Let's try to reach a deal before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers! While I would prefer a higher share, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
