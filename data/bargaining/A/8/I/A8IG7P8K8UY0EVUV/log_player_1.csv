Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fairly aggressive first offer, but I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on before inflation starts to eat away at the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe we can still reach a more equitable agreement. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a deal that gives me such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is still a substantial share, but I'm acknowledging Bob's position and offering a more reasonable split than my first offer.  I hope we can reach an agreement before inflation takes a bigger bite."
