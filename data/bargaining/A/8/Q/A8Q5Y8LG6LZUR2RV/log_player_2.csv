"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take 60% 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's a good starting point, but I'm not sure if a 60/40 split is truly ""fair."" Let's see what else Alice is willing to offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a more balanced split, given the inflation rate. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll take 58%. It's as low as I can go for now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is getting closer to what I want. I'd rather get the money now, before inflation bites further into my share."
