Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to take a little less, but I want a bigger share.  Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to increase my share a bit, but I'm sticking to my position. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the bigger share. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting greedier and the rate of inflation hurts me more.  I need to push for a better split quickly before the money becomes worthless."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer to the end, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's time to be realistic. I'm offering a 65/35 split, with me getting the larger share.  Accept this and we can both get something, or we risk getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is getting dangerous.  Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to pressure me. I'll hold out one more round to see if he becomes more reasonable.  I have to be prepared to make a significant concession in the next round if needed, though."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is ridiculous.  We are running out of time!  Let's split this evenly and get out of here before the money is worthless!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking.  We're both losing money with every passing round. Let's be reasonable and split it 70/30. It's the best deal we can get at this point, or we risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision, but I have to be realistic. Accepting 30 is better than getting nothing, which is a very real possibility now.  Bob seems determined to exploit the situation, and continuing to refuse his offer is getting too risky."
