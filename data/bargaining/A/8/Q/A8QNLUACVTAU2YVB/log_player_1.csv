"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. This offer provides a good balance between your guaranteed share and a higher potential return for me. If you reject this, the next round will see the money worth less for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
