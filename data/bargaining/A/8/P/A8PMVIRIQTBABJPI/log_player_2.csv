Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer to the middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, I believe I can push my advantage further in the next round.  The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice will become."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome now.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I believe I could pressure Alice further, there is a risk she might accept a less favorable deal out of desperation in the next round. It's better to secure a guaranteed 50/50 split now than risk getting a worse deal or reaching a point where Alice is willing to accept a loss just to end the game."
