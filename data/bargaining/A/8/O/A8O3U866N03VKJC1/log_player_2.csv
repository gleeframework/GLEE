"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, but you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's a decent starting offer, there's room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm confident we can find a more even split. Let's be reasonable.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it closer to 60/40. This is fair given the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer is the safest move to ensure I don't lose even more."
