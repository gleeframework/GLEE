Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me a significant majority of the money, but it's still a good starting point. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to accept it, as it's a decent share for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me half of the money. Given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we reach the 12th round, this seems like the most reasonable option."
