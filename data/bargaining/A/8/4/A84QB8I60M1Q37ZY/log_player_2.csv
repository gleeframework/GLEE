"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a fair share and avoid further rounds of negotiation where we both lose value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
