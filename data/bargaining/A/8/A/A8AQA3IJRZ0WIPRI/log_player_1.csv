"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $7,200. Bob's gain of $2,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $1,600.

Bob's new offer is $5,000 for me and $5,000 for him. I'll accept this offer.
