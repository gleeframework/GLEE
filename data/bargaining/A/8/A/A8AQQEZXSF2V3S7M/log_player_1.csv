"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, which is a fair and simple solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good chunk for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, and I'd like to see if I can negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share.""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, while still being reasonable and fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 40.8% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money losing even more value."
