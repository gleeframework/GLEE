"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see if Bob will accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so my gain of 4000 is actually worth 4000 * 0.9 = 3600.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
