Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'm willing to compromise!""}

I'm offering Bob 4000 and keeping 6000 for myself. I'm trying to be fair and split it roughly evenly, but I'm willing to give a bit more to Bob to get the game started."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I was hoping to get a bit more, considering the initial offer I made was already a compromise. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slight edge""}

I'm increasing my offer by 500, trying to get a bit closer to my initial target of 6000. I'm still willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up on getting a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the inflation, and my gain is worth significantly less than it was initially. Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and potential losses due to inflation. 5200 is still a decent amount, and I think it's a fair compromise."
