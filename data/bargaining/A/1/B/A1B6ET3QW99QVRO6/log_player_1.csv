"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.  I think this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will affect Bob more significantly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  The next round would see Bob's offer even more favorable to him, and the inflation will drastically reduce the value of my potential gain."
