"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message that suggests this is a relatively fair split, considering I'm taking on the risk of the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. How about this slight adjustment?  It accounts for the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money's value has decreased, his proposed split doesn't seem to adequately reflect the greater impact of inflation on my share. I'll hold out for a better deal, considering we have 10 more rounds to negotiate. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle from my first offer.""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more conservative offer than my first one, taking into account the decreased value of money for both of us, but still trying to maintain a favorable split. My message suggests that I'm willing to compromise, but still want to prioritize my own gain. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's make this simple. A 50/50 split seems fair considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise at this point. It's better to secure a guaranteed share now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Time to end the game on a mutually agreeable note!\n###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
