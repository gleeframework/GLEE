"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, considering I'm taking the risk of making the first offer. Let's start with a 90/10 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject the offer. It's too unfair in Alice's favor, and there's still plenty of time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'm willing to give you more than a 10/90 split. This is a good starting point for us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a better deal, but I'm not going to accept a 45/55 split.  Let's compromise at 60/40.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation and that I will be taking the risk of making the next offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with that split. I'll reject and see if we can get closer to a 50/50 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome considering the inflation. It's time to compromise.""}
```"
