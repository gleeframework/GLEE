Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to compromise. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but we can't keep rejecting each other's offers. This deal gives us both a reasonable amount. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer in Round 6 mirrors my initial offer. Given the rapid inflation, waiting longer significantly risks both of us getting a much worse deal. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting nothing at all."
