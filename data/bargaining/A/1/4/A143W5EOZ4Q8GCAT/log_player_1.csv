"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my gain of 400,000 is now worth 320,000, which is still a decent amount, but not as good as it was in the first round. On the other hand, Bob's gain of 600,000 is now worth 540,000, which is a significant amount.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My 700,000 from the previous round is now worth only 360,000, and Bob's offer is even more unappealing. I'll have to think carefully about this one.
