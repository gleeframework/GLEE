"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good foundation""}

I'm proposing that I get 800,000 and Bob gets 200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and make a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best approach, especially since the money is worth 10% less now. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the decreased value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Adjusting for inflation, I'll give you a slightly better deal this time""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the 10% decrease in value and offering Bob a slightly better deal than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation. I'm willing to accept 600,000 and give Bob 400,000, as it's a fair division given the current circumstances."
