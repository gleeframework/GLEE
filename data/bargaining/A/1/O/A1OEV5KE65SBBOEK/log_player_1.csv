Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While I could push for more, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of Bob's share is eroding significantly with each round.  He's feeling the pressure, making him more likely to concede in future rounds.
* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point.  Continuing to reject offers significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, while not ideal initially, becomes increasingly fair as the game progresses and inflation eats into Bob's potential gains.

Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout and avoids the risk of a no-deal situation as we approach the final rounds."
