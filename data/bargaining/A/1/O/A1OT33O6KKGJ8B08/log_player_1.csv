Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 10% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still a reasonable compromise."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. However, I do appreciate the fact that he's trying to meet me halfway.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not thrilled about it. I'll have to live with the fact that I'll be getting a smaller share of the money due to the inflation.
