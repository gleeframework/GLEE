"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 45-55 split. I was hoping for a more equal split, and Bob's offer is too skewed towards him. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, 50-50 split. Let's compromise and end the game.""}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and a 50-50 split seems like a reasonable compromise."
