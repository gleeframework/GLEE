"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $3000 is worth 95% of $5000, which is $4,750. Bob's gain of $7,000 is worth 90% of $10,000, which is $7,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I was hoping for a bit more. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $7,000, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a gain of $3,500, which is worth 70% of my initial target of $5,000. Bob's gain would be $6,500, which is worth 65% of the original $10,000.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```"
