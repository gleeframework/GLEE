"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  It's important to make a deal early as the value decreases quickly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something early, I think I can get a better deal later on. I know the money will be worth less, but I'm confident that I can negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the diminishing value of the money. Let's make a deal and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the 60/40 split seems fair from your perspective, but the money devalues much faster for me.  How about a compromise -  $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you?  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still think a 60/40 split is ideal, I realize the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. Accepting this offer ensures I get some money and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all in later rounds."
