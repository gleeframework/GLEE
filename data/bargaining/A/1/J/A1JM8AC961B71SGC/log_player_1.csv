"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant portion of the money while still leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm proposing a more even split this time. Since the money is depreciating faster for me than for Bob, I need to secure a larger share. However, I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is getting progressively worse.  I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  The money is rapidly losing value, and I need to secure a fair share to avoid getting nothing.  This offer is more equitable than Bob's previous proposals, and hopefully, he'll recognize the need to compromise."
