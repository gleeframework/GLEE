While the inflation is hitting me harder, I'm still not willing to settle for such a low offer. I believe I can secure a larger share, especially since Bob's offer is still relatively close to a 50/50 split."

With inflation hitting my gains so hard, I can't afford to be too stubborn anymore. Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, and I'm worried about losing everything if we don't reach an agreement."
