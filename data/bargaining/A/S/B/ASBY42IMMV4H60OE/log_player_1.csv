Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of me, but I'm not going to let him!

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. The money is worth 10% less now, so I'll aim to get a bigger share.

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard! The money is worth a lot less now.

I'll reject this offer, as it's a very small consolation prize. I'm not going to settle for just $100,000 when I could potentially get more.
