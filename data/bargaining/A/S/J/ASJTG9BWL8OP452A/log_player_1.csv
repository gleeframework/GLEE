"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 10% less, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I don't like Bob's offer, I want to get a bigger share. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept it."
