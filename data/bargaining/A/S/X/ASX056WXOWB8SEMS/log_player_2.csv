"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a classic game theory scenario. While the initial offer seems somewhat fair, Bob (me) can do significantly better by waiting. Alice is hurt more by inflation, so she will be increasingly motivated to accept a deal where Bob gets a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I think we can do a bit better. How about a 45/55 split?""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Inflation:**  I'm pushing for a slightly better deal knowing Alice is losing value faster than me.  
* **Appearing Reasonable:** This offer isn't overly aggressive, increasing the chances Alice will consider it. It sets the stage for further negotiation if she rejects it."
