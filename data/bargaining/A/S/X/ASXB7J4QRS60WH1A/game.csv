4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I'm not sure why you offered me such a small share last round. I think it's fair to split this 60/40, with me taking the larger share. We both get a decent amount, and I believe it's a good starting point for a fair deal.  What do you think?",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  But I'm still not comfortable with such a large disparity. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time.  This seems fairer and allows us both to walk away with a decent sum.",Alice,3,
