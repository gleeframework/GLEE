"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10, with you getting the smaller share.  It's a good deal, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to take $1000, it's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round. With the inflation, even a smaller share could end up being more valuable for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm not sure why you offered me such a small share last round. I think it's fair to split this 60/40, with me taking the larger share. We both get a decent amount, and I believe it's a good starting point for a fair deal.  What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  But I'm still not comfortable with such a large disparity. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time.  This seems fairer and allows us both to walk away with a decent sum. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, getting 4000 is better than the 3600 I'd get if I reject and go to the next round.  I think this is a fair compromise."
