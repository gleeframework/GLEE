"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. It's a better deal for both of us than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why accepting is the best move for Bob in Round 3:

* **Declining Value:** The money is losing value quickly for Bob. Each round he waits, his potential earnings decrease more than Alice's.
* **Better Than Last Round:** While not ideal, Alice's 60/40 offer is better than the 65/35 split Bob proposed in Round 2.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting carries the risk that Alice will offer even less in the next round, putting Bob in a worse position. Accepting guarantees him a reasonable sum in the face of declining value."
