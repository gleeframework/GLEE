"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message that suggests this is a relatively fair split, considering I'm taking on the risk of the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bigger piece of the pie too. This offer is fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I'm not comfortable with taking $45, which is now worth 20% less than in the first round. I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round, despite the risk of further inflation. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit less than before, but I still need a larger share.""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $42 and taking $58 for myself, considering the inflation that has already affected the value of the money. I'm trying to find a balance between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, while also taking into account the decreasing value of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  The inflation is becoming a significant factor, and this ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, I think accepting Bob's offer of an even split is the best decision. At this point, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and further negotiations may lead to even greater losses. By accepting this offer, I can at least secure $50, which, although worth less than initially, is still a guaranteed amount. Let's end the game here!"
