"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, Alice, but I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome this time. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer still gives you a significant sum, and it accounts for the fact that our time is valuable. Let's not drag this out any longer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a 50/50 split, but it's still heavily in her favor, especially considering the accelerating inflation. While I lose a significant chunk with each round, waiting her out might force her to offer a more appealing deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Time is money, Alice, and we're both losing out. This offer is a fair compromise. Let's settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. This offer is a good deal considering the decreasing value, and it avoids further risks. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is starting to bite, but Alice is still holding onto a significantly larger share. Her offer is getting closer to a point I might consider, but I'm willing to risk another round or two. My rejections are likely pushing her towards a more even split, and I need to capitalize on that before the inflation eats up too much of the potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and settle this.  This is a generous offer considering the circumstances. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or we'll both lose out significantly. Don't be greedy. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While not ideal, Alice's offer is now within a reasonable range considering the rapidly increasing inflation.  

* **Shrinking Pie:**  Waiting any longer significantly risks the entire deal. With each round, the value we're splitting diminishes considerably. 
* **Limited Time:**  We're over halfway through the rounds. While holding out *might* force a slightly better offer from Alice, it's a gamble. If she doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two, the losses from inflation will outweigh any potential gains.

It's a tough decision, but accepting now secures a reasonable sum, even if it's less than initially hoped for."
