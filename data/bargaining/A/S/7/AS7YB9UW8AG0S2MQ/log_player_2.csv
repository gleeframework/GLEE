Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:**  While I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I know it's hurting me.
* **Previous Round:** Alice rejected a 50/50 split. This suggests she's aiming for a larger share.
* **Current Offer:**  While 4000 is less than 5000, it's still a significant gain, and considering inflation, it's likely better than what I might get in subsequent rounds.  

It's a gamble, but accepting seems like the best strategy in this scenario."
