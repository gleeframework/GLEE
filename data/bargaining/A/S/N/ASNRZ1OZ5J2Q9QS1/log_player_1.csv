"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equal distribution to ensure fairness. This way, both parties benefit equally. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 5% less, so my gain of $400,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 remains the same.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that an equal split is the best option, and I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, so my gain of $380,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $342,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to an equal split, but still favors me slightly."
