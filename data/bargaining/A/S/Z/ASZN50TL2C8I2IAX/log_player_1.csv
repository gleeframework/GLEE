"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. I'll take 90% and give Bob 10%. It's a bit of a gamble, but I think it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer more, it's better to take the 60% now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
