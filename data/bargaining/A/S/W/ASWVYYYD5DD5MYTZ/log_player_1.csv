"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering the inflation penalty he'll face if he rejects it. This way, I'll get a bigger share, but Bob will still get a significant amount, and we can both walk away happy. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is fair, but you can have the bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nNo way! Bob is trying to turn the tables on me, but I won't accept a deal that gives me less than what I offered him initially. The inflation penalty hasn't affected me, so I can afford to wait for a better offer. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""You had your chance, now it's my turn again! Considering the inflation, you should be happy with 35%!""}\n\nI'll increase my share to 65% and offer Bob 35%. Since Bob's share is worth 20% less with each passing round, he should be more willing to accept a smaller share to avoid further losses. This way, I'll get an even bigger share, and Bob will still get something, albeit less than before. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob is trying to go back to the original 60-40 split, but I've already offered him a worse deal, and he rejected it. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can keep pushing for a better offer. Bob's share is now worth almost 50% less than the original amount, so he should be more desperate to accept a deal. I'll keep waiting for a better offer or try to negotiate an even better deal for myself in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! With inflation eating away at your share, you should be grateful for 30%!""}\n\nI'll increase my share to 70% and offer Bob 30%. Since Bob's share is now worth almost 50% less than the original amount, he should be getting desperate to accept a deal. I'll take advantage of this and push for an even better offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this deal or if he'll try to negotiate further!"

# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is finally starting to feel the pressure of inflation and is willing to accept a smaller share. However, I've already offered him a worse deal, and he rejected it. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can keep pushing for a better offer. But considering that Bob's share is now worth over 67% less than the original amount, this offer is actually quite reasonable. I'll think carefully about this one... Ah, who am I kidding? I can do better than this! {""decision"": ""reject""}"

With inflation eating away at your share, 25% is a generous offer. Take it or leave it!""}\n\nI'll increase my share to 75% and offer Bob 25%. Since Bob's share is now worth over 67% less than the original amount, he should be extremely desperate to accept a deal. I'll take advantage of this and push for an even better offer.

Since this offer is the same as the one I made in Round 7, I'll gladly accept it. After all, I'm getting the better end of the deal, and I won't risk losing everything by pushing for an even better offer. It's time to seal the deal! {""decision"": ""accept""}"
