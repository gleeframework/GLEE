Let's start with a relatively generous offer to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. It's better to see if we can negotiate a more equitable split, even with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, taking into account the inflation. Hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the money depreciates further."
