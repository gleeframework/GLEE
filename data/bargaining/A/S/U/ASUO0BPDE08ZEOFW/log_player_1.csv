"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer, suggesting a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, you can't do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 400k for me and 600k for himself, I'll try to counter with an offer that gives me a slightly higher share. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You said I couldn't do better than 400k, I think I can!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving away too much more! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground, but still wants to keep a slightly larger share.

I'll think for a moment... If I accept this offer, I'll get 480k, which is a bit better than my previous offer of 450k, but still not as good as my original 550k. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 480k for me and 520k for himself, I'll try to push for a better deal. I'll aim to get closer to the 50/50 split we had in the first round, but with a slightly better ratio for me. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but with a slight edge for me""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal for himself, but is willing to give me a slight edge.

I'll think for a moment... If I accept this offer, I'll get 510k, which is a bit better than my previous offer of 480k, but still not as good as my original 550k. However, I don't want to risk going back to the 50/50 split, so I'll decide to accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
