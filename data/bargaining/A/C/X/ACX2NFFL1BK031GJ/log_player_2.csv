**Reasoning:**

Even though the inflation is hitting hard, accepting Alice's offer would mean losing a significant portion of the money.  I'm betting she'll start getting nervous as the rounds progress and we get closer to the deadline.  There's a chance she'll offer a better deal in the later rounds."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split was a good try, but I know the inflation is hurting you 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming extreme, and Alice knows it. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to take a smaller cut now than risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
