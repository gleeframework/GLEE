"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm hoping to get a good deal on the first round, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept the offer. While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes it unwise to risk getting nothing at all."
