"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money fairly, with me taking a slightly larger share. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal, as I think I can get a larger share. Let's proceed to the next round. What's my proposal for Round 2?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we should split it more evenly, but with me taking the larger share this time. It's only fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth more in the earlier rounds, and also attempting to negotiate for a larger share. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a more even split this time, with me taking a slight edge. This way, we can both get a reasonable amount before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm still not satisfied with Alice's offer, and I think I can negotiate for a better deal. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to try to get as much as I can. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'd like to make a proposal for Round 4. Here it is:\n\n###\n{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it as evenly as possible. We both get a decent share, and we can both walk away with a good amount.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to compromise and find a middle ground that Alice will accept. I'm hoping this offer will be more to her liking, and we can end the game with a mutually beneficial agreement."
