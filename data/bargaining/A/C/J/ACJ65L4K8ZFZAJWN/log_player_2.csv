"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share. Accept this and we both get something.

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's try 7000 for me, 3000 for you.  This is a good deal for both of us, especially with the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my shrinking pot. While 3000 is a reasonable sum, accepting now sets a precedent that she can lowball me due to the inflation working in her favor. I need to hold out for a better deal."
