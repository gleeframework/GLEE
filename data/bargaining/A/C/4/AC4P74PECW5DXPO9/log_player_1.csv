"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and the money is still worth its full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, the money is worth less now. I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it evenly just yet. I think I can do better than that, considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking effect, the money is now worth 90% of its original value for me, and 95% of its original value for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to secure a decent share for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount, and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a more aggressive offer, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need to get something back for myself too. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, the money is now worth 73.9% of its original value for me, and 85.74% of its original value for Bob.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this. I'm not willing to give up 40% of the remaining value, especially since the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking effect, the money is now worth 66.71% of its original value for me, and 80.58% of its original value for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the remaining value, and keeping $550,000 for myself. This is a slightly more aggressive offer, considering the reduced value of the money."
