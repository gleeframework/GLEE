"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount to start with, hoping that he'll accept and we can negotiate further."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too low, I'm willing to compromise, but I want more""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will come back with an even better offer in the next round."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher amount than before, but still keeping the majority for myself."

# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a significant toll on the money's value, I need to be even more careful with my decision. My gain is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too low, I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value now. My gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and it's getting harder to make ends meet. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going back to my original offer, it's the best I can do""
}

# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eroding the value of the money now. My gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, and I'm starting to feel the pinch. However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than before, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
