"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be reasonable. I propose a 40/60 split in your favor.  It accounts for the time-value and gives us both a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
