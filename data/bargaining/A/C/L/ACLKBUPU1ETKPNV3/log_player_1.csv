"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a generous offer considering I'm taking the risk of getting nothing if you reject it.  Let's see if you're willing to be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to take the $20, I'm not going to be taken advantage of! I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal than 20%. This 80/20 split is fair considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we don't come to an agreement. Let's see if Bob is ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to settle for such a low offer!  I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the increasing inflation.  This 70/30 split is still fair, considering we both have a lot to lose if we don't agree. Let's see if Bob is finally ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the money is getting smaller and smaller with each round, I won't be taken advantage of! I'll keep trying for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

The inflation is making it harder and harder to get a good deal, but I'm still going to try. I'm offering a 60/40 split, which seems reasonable considering the losses we'll both face if we don't agree. Let's see if Bob finally sees reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to give up just yet. While this offer is extremely low, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal.  I'm not going to be bullied into accepting this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

The inflation is getting serious now.  I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's the fairest offer at this point, and we both stand to lose a lot if we don't agree. Let's call it a draw and end this game."
