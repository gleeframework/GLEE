"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 3:1 ratio, favoring you slightly to encourage fairness. I believe this is a reasonable offer considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 3:1 is too generous. I'll offer a 2:1 split, which still favors you slightly, but I think it's a fairer reflection of the diminishing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
