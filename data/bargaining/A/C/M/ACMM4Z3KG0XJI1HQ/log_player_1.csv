I'm going to try to secure the majority of the money in this round. I'll offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing if we go through more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll accept Bob's offer. Although it's a significant drop from my initial proposal, the inflation rate is making the risk of further rounds too high.  I'll take the $2000, even though it's worth less due to inflation, rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
