I'm going to try to maximize my share while still making it somewhat appealing to Bob.  Let's see if he's greedy or reasonable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is pretty bad for me, even with the inflation factor. I'm going to try to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm taking into account the inflation and trying to find a middle ground. I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share than his previous offer, but still a significant amount. Hopefully, he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer, as the next round will likely be even worse for him due to inflation."
