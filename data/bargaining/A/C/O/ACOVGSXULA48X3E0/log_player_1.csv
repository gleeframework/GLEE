Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

While a 50/50 split seems fair, I can still aim for a better outcome for myself since I'll be making the offer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

This is a tough one, but I should accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is rapidly losing value. Waiting any longer means a smaller pot for both of us.
* **Bob's offer:** It's not the best, but it's better than what I'd get if I reject and make an offer in Round 5 (where the value would drop even further). 

It's a compromise, but the risk of getting even less in the next round is too high."
