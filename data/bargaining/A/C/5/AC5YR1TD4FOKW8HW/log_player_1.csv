"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount to keep the negotiations going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split. Let's start with that and see how it goes. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer, considering the inflation factor.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. With the current offer, I'd gain $40, but its value would be equivalent to $36 in the first round's terms.

Considering this, I'll have to decide whether to accept the offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation. Let's see if you're willing to meet me halfway.""
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves Bob with a smaller portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer, or at least be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go down to 55 for you, but I don't think it's fair to give you 80% of the money. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor continuing to erode the value of the money, I need to be even more cautious. Considering the offer, I'd gain $45, but its value would be equivalent to $34.85 in the first round's terms.

While Bob's offer is more generous than his previous one, I'm not sure if it's enough to accept. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor continuing to decrease the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share than before. However, I'll also take into account that Bob's offer was more generous than his previous one, so I'll try to find a balance.

Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a slightly larger share to account for the inflation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.""
}
```

This offer gives me a higher share than before, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer or be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to get at least 45. We're running out of time, let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor continuing to erode the value of the money, I need to be careful. Considering the offer, I'd gain $55, but its value would be equivalent to $29.05 in the first round's terms.

While Bob's offer is more generous than his previous ones, I'm not sure if it's enough to accept, given the significant inflation factor. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

However, I also need to consider the time constraint and the fact that we're running out of rounds. I might need to make a more decisive decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor continuing to decrease the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share than before. However, I'll also take into account that we're running out of time and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to prioritize my own gain given the inflation. Let's see if you're willing to accept this offer.""
}
```

This offer gives me a higher share than before, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer or be willing to negotiate further, but I'm also prepared to accept that this might be my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to go down to 40. We're nearing the end and need to reach a deal. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor continuing to erode the value of the money, I need to be careful. Considering the offer, I'd gain $60, but its value would be equivalent to $18.18 in the first round's terms.

While Bob's offer is more generous than his previous ones, I'm not sure if it's enough to accept, given the significant inflation factor. However, I also need to consider the time constraint and the fact that we're running out of rounds.

I'll have to weigh the pros and cons and make a decision.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor continuing to decrease the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share than before. However, I'll also take into account that we're running out of time and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I need to prioritize my own gain given the inflation. This is my final offer, let's see if you'll accept it.""
}
```

This offer gives me a high share, but still leaves Bob with a small portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer, but I'm also prepared for the possibility that he might reject it and we'll end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're almost out of time. I'm willing to go down to 35, but I can't go any lower. It's time to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor continuing to erode the value of the money, I need to be very careful. Considering the offer, I'd gain $65, but its value would be equivalent to $12.38 in the first round's terms.

While Bob's offer is more generous than his previous ones, I'm still not sure if it's enough to accept, given the significant inflation factor. However, I also need to consider the time constraint and the fact that we're running out of rounds.

I'll have to weigh the pros and cons and make a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, but I'm starting to think that we might end up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement soon."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor continuing to decrease the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share than before. However, I'll also take into account that we're running out of time and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I need to prioritize my own gain given the inflation. I'm willing to give you a small share, but I need to make a decision now.""
}
```

This offer gives me a very high share, but still leaves Bob with a small portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared for the possibility that he might reject it and we'll end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're out of time. This is my final offer. Let's split the money 25-75, or we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor continuing to erode the value of the money, I'm left with very little choice. Considering the offer, I'd gain $75, but its value would be equivalent to $6.21 in the first round's terms.

While this offer is not ideal, I'm willing to accept it rather than risk losing everything. I'll take the $6.21 and consider it a small victory.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and hope that we can both walk away with something, no matter how small."
