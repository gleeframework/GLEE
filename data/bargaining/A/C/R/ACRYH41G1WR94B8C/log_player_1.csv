Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split. This reflects a fairer division while still ensuring you receive a significant portion. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
