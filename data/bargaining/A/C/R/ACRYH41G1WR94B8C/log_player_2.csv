{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too far in your favor. Let's meet in the middle at a 55/45 split.  This is a fair and reasonable compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
