"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split.  Let's get this done quickly, as the value of the money will go down if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
