"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is 30% of the original $100. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm also trying to keep some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of $50 is worth 90% of the original $70, since there's been 10% inflation since the first round. 

I accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
