"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start fair. Take 1000, and I'll take the rest. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. 1000 dollars is not a lot, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, Alice. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle.  I'll take 6500, you take 3500.  We can both get a decent share, and avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While I'd like more, the inflation is hurting, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
