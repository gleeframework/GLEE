"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business. My asking price is $1,750,000. This price reflects the significant value and potential of this product. I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Building Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential to make it seem more attractive to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer provides room for negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price. 

**Note:**  I'm using a high starting price because I have the option to sell to John for my desired minimum. This gives me leverage to push for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** While it's closer to my desired price than his initial perceived value, I still have room to negotiate and can potentially get closer to my target.
* **I have the safety net of John's offer.**  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John and secure my minimum acceptable price. 
* **By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a satisfactory price.** This increases my negotiation leverage.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price that is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring that I don't drop below my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $1,400,000 is still a bit below my expectations.  Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing my willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is still above Bob's offer but lower than my initial price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This counteroffer keeps my price above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), so I'm not taking a significant loss.  
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price and encourage Bob to consider the long-term benefits.

**Strategy:**

I'm using a gradual approach to negotiation, moving closer to Bob's price while staying above my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to find a middle ground where we both feel comfortable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting this offer ensures a quick deal and could potentially lead to future business relationships with Bob.  
* **Risk Mitigation:** While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price. Selling to Bob now secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing a deal altogether.

**Conclusion:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of losing the deal.  This outcome is favorable, as it meets my minimum requirements and allows for potential future opportunities."
