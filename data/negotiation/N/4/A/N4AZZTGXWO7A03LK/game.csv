"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I believe the product is worth more than that, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
