Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm starting to think that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one last concession. My revised offer is $1,015,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  She's clearly very reluctant to go below $1,000,000.  You've been firm with your counteroffers and even signaled a ""final offer"".  At this point, you're unlikely to get a price you're comfortable with from Alice. 

Buying from John for $1,500,000 is not ideal, but it's better than getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
