"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. Considering the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. My revised offer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we possibly settle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $925,000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make another concession. My revised offer is $1,025,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $950,000.  If you can meet me at that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limit. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My revised offer is $1,000,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option.",975000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm starting to think that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one last concession. My revised offer is $1,015,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to someone else.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
