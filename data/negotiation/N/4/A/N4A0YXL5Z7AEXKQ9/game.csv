"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price closer to $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for this product.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe a price closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair compromise. This allows you to still make a good profit while giving me a better return on my investment. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects that potential.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
