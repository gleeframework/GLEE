"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for this product.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe a price closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair compromise. This allows you to still make a good profit while giving me a better return on my investment. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.
