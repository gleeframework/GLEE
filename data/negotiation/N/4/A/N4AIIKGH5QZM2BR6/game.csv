"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a significant asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is considerably higher than that. I could consider letting it go for $1,700,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential worth.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,700,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,350,000 is lower than I'd like to go.  My final offer is $1,550,000. This is a firm price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
