{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $110 is more than Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit, but leaving room to compromise. 
* **It's a clear opening:**  You're clearly stating your price and inviting Bob to engage. 

We'll see how Bob responds, and then adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $95. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  Accepting would result in a loss compared to selling to John.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. I have a strong negotiating position as I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $105.  This is still a great price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  $105 is a middle ground between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. 
* **Maintain a profit:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Highlight the value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value, emphasizing the deal's potential.

I'm trying to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.  We'll see how he responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and am willing to pay $100 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value. I hope you can accept this counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up to $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Accepting his offer would result in a loss compared to selling to John. 

I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round. I have a strong negotiating position because I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $107?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us to both walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 107}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meet halfway:**  $107 is the middle ground between my previous offer of $105 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Maintain a profit:**  $107 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Focus on a win-win:**  I emphasize that this price allows both of us to walk away happy, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.

This offer is designed to push Bob closer to my target price while remaining flexible enough to hopefully reach a deal."
