Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. $800,000 is still a good price for me, but it gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much."

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still determined to get a better price.  We're getting close to a deal, but I don't want to settle for a price that's too high just yet."

Alice is finally getting closer to my price.  While I'd like to see it go even lower, I'm comfortable accepting $880,000, especially since we're running out of rounds.  It's a good deal for both of us."
