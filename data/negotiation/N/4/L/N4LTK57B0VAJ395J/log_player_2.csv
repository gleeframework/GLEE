"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I know you've been interested. I'm asking for $13,000 to start.  I think its fair given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,000 is way over his budget. He can get the same product for $8,000 from John, or try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. This product is very valuable, and I'm confident it's worth more to you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice."
