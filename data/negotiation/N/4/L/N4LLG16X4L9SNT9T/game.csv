,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $105. Would you consider that?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $107.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit high for me. How about $106? It's a fair price that's closer to my budget.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $106 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $108. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,
