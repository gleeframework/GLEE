Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and expresses confidence in Bob's potential appreciation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it provides an opportunity to continue the negotiation. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I have John's offer of $150 as a backup, giving me room to potentially negotiate a better price with Bob without risking a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $155. This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Value Proposition:**  My message reiterates the ""good deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of value.
* **Open Ended Question:** I'm ending with a question, inviting Bob to respond and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $155 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's getting closer, it's not a good deal for me.
* **Negotiation continues:**  I'm still willing to negotiate, hoping to get closer to my target price.
* **John's offer provides security:** Having John's offer of $150 as a backup gives me the freedom to continue negotiating with Bob without risking a loss."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $135 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $145. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise by dropping my price from $155 to $145.  This shows I'm still willing to negotiate but not willing to go below my minimum price.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I emphasize ""fair price"" and ""happy"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Focus on Closing:** I'm using more direct language to encourage Bob to accept my offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

* **John's offer is my safety net:**  Having John's offer of $150 gives me the confidence to keep negotiating with Bob without risking a loss.
