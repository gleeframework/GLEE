"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $155. This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.  What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $155 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say?",135.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not comfortable going below $145. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about getting this, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $145 is my final offer.  What do you say?",145.0,Alice,7,
