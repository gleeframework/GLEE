Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he is willing to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I have the safety net of selling to John for a much higher price if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price from $10,000 to $9,500. This shows I'm flexible and serious about making a deal.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to justify my counteroffer.
* **Open invitation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, but I'm not giving away too much ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product is worth it at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $9,000 is only $3,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer again, he might walk away, and I could end up with nothing.
* **Potential for future sales:** Even though I'm selling for less than my ideal price, there's a possibility that Bob could become a repeat customer in the future, leading to additional sales. 

This is a calculated risk, but based on the information provided, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best move to maximize my potential earnings in this scenario."
