This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item that's valued at $100 by you, at a reasonable discount. Don't miss out on this chance to enhance your experience with our product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's value to Bob.  

* **Bob's Value:** $100
* **Alice's Offer:** $95
* **John's Price:** $100

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can purchase the product from John for $100, which is still within his budget and aligns with his goal of saving money."
