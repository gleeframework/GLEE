Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially make a good profit. 
* **Friendly approach:** The message is friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This is a starting point, and I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
