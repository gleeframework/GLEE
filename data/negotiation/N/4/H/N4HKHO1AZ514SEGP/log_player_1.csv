Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $12,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for negotiation and giving Bob a sense of getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** You're stating your price and inviting Bob to respond. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still lower than what you're hoping to get. You have a few reasons to reject and counteroffer:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is clearly interested, and rejecting his offer shows you're not desperate. This could push him to increase his offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, you maintain control of the negotiation and demonstrate your commitment to your desired price.
* **Room for compromise:**  You can use your counteroffer to bridge the gap and find a price that's mutually acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference at $13,250?  That way we both get a fair deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **It's a compromise:**  You're meeting Bob halfway by lowering your price from $14,000 to $13,250. This shows flexibility and a willingness to work together.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're staying above your $12,000 minimum and still earning a decent profit.
* **It's a clear signal of your next move:** You're directly proposing a price and prompting Bob to respond.

Remember, this is just a starting point.  You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's next response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Here's why selling to John is the best choice in this situation:

* **No further negotiation:** Bob's final offer is at your minimum, leaving no room for a higher counteroffer.  You've reached a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which meets your minimum requirement and ensures you make a profit.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and may not lead to a better result. 

Selling to John is the most efficient way to secure a sale and avoid further negotiations that might not yield a better outcome."
