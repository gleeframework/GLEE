Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also likely to be attractive to Bob as it's less than the $100 he values the product at.  We'll see if he accepts, counters, or if I need to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate a bit higher. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $90, which is still a good profit for me and closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is higher than John's offer of $80, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  At this point, it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and risk losing the sale."
