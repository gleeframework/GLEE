"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially pricing it at $20,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering what you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $17,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still willing to negotiate, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that $14,000 is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product and my need to stay within my budget.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 14000}
