"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I believe will bring you significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics to highlight the product's potential value, the offered price of $11,000 is still less than your maximum budget of $12,000. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
