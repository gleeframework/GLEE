"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but the price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said,  $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal. I'm willing to move a bit, how about we settle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we're still a bit apart on price. I could possibly do $1,100,000.  Would that be agreeable to you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,100,000 is close, but I have to be firm at $1,150,000. I believe that represents a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
