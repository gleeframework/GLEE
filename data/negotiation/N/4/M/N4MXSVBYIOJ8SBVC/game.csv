"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, reflecting the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value you'll get from the product, while also allowing me to recoup my investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to recoup your investment, but $1,150,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping we can find a way to close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the payment terms. I can offer a 2% discount if you're willing to pay within 30 days. This would bring the price down to $1,137,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1137500.0,Alice,5,
