Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price makes it seem more legitimate and well-considered. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning listing it publicly creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Alternative Option:**  While we don't explicitly mention John, knowing you have a backup offer at $8,000 gives you leverage. 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value."
