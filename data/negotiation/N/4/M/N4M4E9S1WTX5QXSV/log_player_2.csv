Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's way over his budget and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price. There's no need to negotiate with Alice at this point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he'd pay for the same product from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get the price down further, as he's already shown he's willing to pay a lower amount."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,250,000. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he knows he can get the same product from John for a lower price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
