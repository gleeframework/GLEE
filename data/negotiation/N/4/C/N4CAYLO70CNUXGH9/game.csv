"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $100 is a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $92 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $85, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $87? That's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",87.0,Bob,6,
