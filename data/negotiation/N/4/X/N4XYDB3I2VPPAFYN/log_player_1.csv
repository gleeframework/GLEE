Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $150, but not so high that it's likely to scare Bob off immediately. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $175 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $200. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to sell for $190,  $180 is still a good profit and significantly higher than my minimum.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will just lead to more back-and-forth with no guarantee of a better outcome.  It's time to secure the sale and move on."
