Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $10,000, to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also framing the message in a positive way, emphasizing the product's value and my openness to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value might be high to you, but considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room for negotiation and want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the market value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9200 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to accept $9,200, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,400. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in adjusting the price, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $9300. I believe this strikes a balance between fairness and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and while I would prefer a higher price, $9,300 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and we're close to the end of the negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to haggle."
