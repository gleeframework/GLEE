Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and significantly less than the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for the product.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum asking price and well below the product's value to me.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum asking price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you and it's a step closer to my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and it gets us much closer to closing this deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is tempting, I still have a few rounds left to try and get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000.
