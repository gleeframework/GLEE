"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and significantly less than the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget.  He wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for the product.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you and it's a step closer to my minimum. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only lowered the price by $50,000, which isn't a significant enough change for Bob.  He's still trying to get closer to his target price of $800,000 and would rather continue negotiating.  Rejecting the offer gives him the opportunity to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and it gets us much closer to closing this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only lowered the price by $50,000 again, which is not enough for Bob.  He's running out of time and is concerned that if he rejects the offer again, Alice might not come down further.  It's better for Bob to purchase from John at this point to guarantee a good deal and avoid the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice."
