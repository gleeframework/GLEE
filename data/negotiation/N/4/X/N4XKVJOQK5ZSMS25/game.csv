"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $82? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $82. I'm thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $79. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",79.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from $79. I'm thinking more along the lines of $76. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get as close to my budget as possible.",76.0,Bob,6,
