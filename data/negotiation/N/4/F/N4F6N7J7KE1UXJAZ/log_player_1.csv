{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is stuck on $1,200,000. It's time to show him we're serious about the $1,300,000 and willing to walk away.  This might push him to meet in the middle, or at least move closer to our price."

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has significantly dropped his offer and is no longer negotiating in good faith. He's unlikely to meet the $1,300,000 price point.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the safer option at this point to guarantee a minimum profit and avoid further haggling with Bob."
