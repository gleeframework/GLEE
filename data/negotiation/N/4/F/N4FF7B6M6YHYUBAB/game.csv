"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price is still fair for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $9,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a solution. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate me. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my maximum budget of $8,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere around $9,200? I believe this would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9200.0,Bob,6,
