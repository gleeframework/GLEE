# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I've done some research and I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. You can definitely get a better price.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to your target price or at least closer to Alice's minimum."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely get a better price, especially since you know that Alice is willing to go as low as $800,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $875,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $875,000 is still higher than you're comfortable paying. It's important to remember that you have a backup option in John, who is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. This means you have leverage in the negotiation and can afford to be a little more firm. 

Since Alice has already conceded once, there's a good chance she might be willing to come down a bit further if you push. Continue the negotiation and see if you can reach a price closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to accept $850,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $875,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut your losses and buy from John. Alice is now stuck at $875,000, which is still a significant amount higher than what you're comfortable paying. While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely that she will come down any further, especially since she's already made several concessions.  You're better off buying from John for $1,500,000, even though it's more expensive. It's important to remember that saving $625,000 is better than potentially getting stuck in a long and ultimately fruitless negotiation."
