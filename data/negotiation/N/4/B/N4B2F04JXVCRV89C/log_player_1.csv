Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,500.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay a premium.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price of $11,500 aims higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly without overthinking.

**Important Note:** While you have a fallback option with John, it's essential to gauge Bob's interest and be prepared to adjust your price slightly if he seems hesitant but potentially interested."
