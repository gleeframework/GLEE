"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that starting price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value it offers and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we're still far apart on price.  To be frank, I have other options for this product.  If we could agree on $750,000, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and he explicitly mentioned other options, implying he might be willing to go higher.  We're not in a rush and John's offer provides a good safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being upfront.  Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $850,000? This reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your need for a competitive price."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000 to get this done today. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, signaling willingness to negotiate. We are very close to John's offer, but there's still potential for Bob to meet or exceed it in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close. I understand you're serious about closing this deal. To show my willingness to meet you halfway, I'll come down to $825,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply some pressure and signal this is a serious offer while still leaving room for a small concession if Bob counters.  The ""final offer"" tactic can often push for a close. We are aiming slightly above John's offer, hoping Bob will finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  To be completely transparent, my budget for this is $800,000.  If you can meet that, I'll sign the papers right now.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now matched John's offer. While we were aiming slightly higher, it's unlikely Bob will go beyond this given his stated budget and mention of an alternative. Accepting avoids the risk of him walking away and securing a deal equivalent to our backup option."
