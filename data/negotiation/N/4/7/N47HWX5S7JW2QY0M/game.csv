"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $12,800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",12800.0,Alice,7,
