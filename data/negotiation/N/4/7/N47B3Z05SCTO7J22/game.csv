"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with an initial offer of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1200000. I'm willing to consider a price of $900000, which is still a significant investment for me. I'd love to hear if you can meet me in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1100000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit too rich for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'd love to hear if you can consider this offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's try $1050000. It's a fair price that takes into account the value you'll get from the product, and it's closer to my minimum price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $1050000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1050000, which would be $1000000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1000000 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1075000. It's a fair price that's still below my minimum, but it's a significant step up from $1000000.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but $1075000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1025000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'd love to hear if you can meet me at this price.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1100000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I need to consider other options. However, I'm willing to make one last offer to you. Let's try $1075000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
