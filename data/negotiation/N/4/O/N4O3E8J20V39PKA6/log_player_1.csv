""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing further. "",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? I feel that reflects a fair price considering the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below both my valuation and his own. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. Its unique features and market potential justify a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I still have room to negotiate and believe I can get a better deal than $950,000. I'll aim for a smaller concession in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close!  To show my willingness to close this deal, I'm prepared to come down slightly. How about $1,000,000 even? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1000000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're really making me work for this!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and this offer is a good compromise. It's better to secure a deal now at $975,000 than risk him walking away and settling for John's $1,000,000 offer."
