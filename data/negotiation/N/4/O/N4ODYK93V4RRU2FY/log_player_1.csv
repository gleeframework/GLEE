Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal.""
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price, even if not explicitly stated. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $12,000, it's ideal to secure a deal with Bob at a higher price. This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the fallback option."
