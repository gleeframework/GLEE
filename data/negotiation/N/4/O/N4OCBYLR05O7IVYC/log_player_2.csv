{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,150,000.  This shows that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  It's a compromise that could potentially be acceptable to Alice."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still $50,000 above my maximum. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Alice has already lowered her price significantly, so it's likely she'll accept this final offer to close the deal. If she doesn't, I'll buy the product from John."
