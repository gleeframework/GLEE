"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $900,000 is far too low for me. I believe the product's value justifies a higher price, and I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to meet you halfway.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering $1050000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I appreciate Bob's effort to compromise, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'm counteroffering $1225000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

This is a good deal for me. While it's just slightly above my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident that I can find another buyer for this product in the future."
