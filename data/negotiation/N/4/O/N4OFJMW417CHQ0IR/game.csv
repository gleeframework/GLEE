"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1300000 to meet you halfway. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering $1050000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
