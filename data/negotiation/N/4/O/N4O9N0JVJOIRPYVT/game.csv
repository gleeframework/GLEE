"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a reasonable compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $115 is a good number, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $125? That way, we both get a fair deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, my budget is quite tight, and $125 is pushing it. I'd be willing to do $118, but that's my absolute limit.",118.0,Bob,6,
