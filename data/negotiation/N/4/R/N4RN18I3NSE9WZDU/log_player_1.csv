**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, his pace is too slow to be worthwhile. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that significantly closes the gap between his offer and John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
