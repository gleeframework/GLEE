Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves me with a good profit margin. It's also above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, so there's potential for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price and doesn't leave enough room for profit.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. It's still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's tempting enough for Bob to accept. If not, I'll be prepared to either go lower or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low. I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, even though it means missing out on a sale with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I get my desired value."
