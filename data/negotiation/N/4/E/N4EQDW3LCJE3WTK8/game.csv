"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000. This brings us closer to each other and allows for a more favorable transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
