"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $12,000. He has a ceiling of $15,000 and Alice values the product at $8,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to get the lowest price possible. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $12,000.
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves room for further negotiation, as there's a $1,000 difference between Bob's offer and Alice's likely minimum acceptable price (slightly above her $8,000 value).
* **Balance:**  This counteroffer is aggressive but not unreasonable, making it more likely Alice will consider it and engage in further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:**  Alice's offer of $10,500 is a substantial reduction from her previous offer of $12,000 and is well within Bob's budget.
* **Value vs. Risk:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely. Alice may not be willing to go lower, and Bob risks ending up paying the full $15,000 to John.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could consume more time and effort, which might not be worth the potential savings.

Accepting Alice's offer provides a good deal while minimizing risk and potential complications."
