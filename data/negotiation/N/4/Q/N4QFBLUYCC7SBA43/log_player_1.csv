Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, considering the product is worth $15,000 to him. However, I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary, while still aiming for a price closer to the value I know the product holds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $10,500.  This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay a bit more, but still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm confident this is a reasonable price, considering the product's worth to both of us.  I'm hopeful that this will be a good enough incentive for Bob to accept the deal, as it's closer to his initial offer than my previous one."
