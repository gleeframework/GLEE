"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my target price.  I believe Bob, valuing the product at $800,000, may be willing to negotiate within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell for anything less than $800,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum value. Hopefully, this compromise will be acceptable to him, and we can reach a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum value and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
