"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $900,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to test Alice's willingness to negotiate.  I'm offering $750,000, which is still a good deal for her since her minimum is $800,000.  This should initiate a negotiation and see if she's willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her first, it's still above my target. I'll reject and continue negotiating. There's room for improvement, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to go all in and offer Alice her minimum price.  This shows her I'm serious about buying, and it might incentivize her to accept rather than risk losing the deal entirely."
