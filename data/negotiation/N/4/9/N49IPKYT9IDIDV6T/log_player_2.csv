"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which holds significant value for you at $15,000. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a product that could potentially be worth much more in the future. I look forward to your positive response. Kind regards, Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000, but it's still more than what the product is worth to Bob.  Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price or look for other sellers."
