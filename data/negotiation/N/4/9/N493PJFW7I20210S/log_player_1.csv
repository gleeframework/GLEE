Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

The goal is to earn as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good offer,  it's still below my target. I'm going to try to get closer to the $1,000,000 mark before accepting."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still hopeful I can push for a higher price. I have a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a lower price than I believe this product is worth."

It's down to the wire, and while I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, I'm starting to run out of time.  I've made it clear that I'm willing to compromise, but he's been pretty insistent on a price that's just below my minimum.  It's not worth risking losing the deal entirely.  I'm going to take the safe route and sell the product to John. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and it guarantees I won't walk away empty-handed."
