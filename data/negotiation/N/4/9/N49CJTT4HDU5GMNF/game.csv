"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $850,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.  How about $825,000?  That leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $825,000 is a bit out of my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $775,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $775,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference.  How about $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
