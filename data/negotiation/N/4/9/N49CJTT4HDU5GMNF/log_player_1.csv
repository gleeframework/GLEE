Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $850,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
