Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). However, the message emphasizes exclusivity and potential, hoping to sway Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a sale price higher than $1,200,000 if he's eager.

This strategy balances securing a good deal with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
