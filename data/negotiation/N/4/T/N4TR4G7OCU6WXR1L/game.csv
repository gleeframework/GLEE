This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price that still reflects its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $7,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",7250.0,Alice,5,
