# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and seeing if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.

This is a good price point to accept. Alice has indicated this is her lowest offer, and while we might be able to push a little further, the potential savings are not substantial enough to risk her walking away from the deal.  We've managed to get the price down by $75,000, which is a good outcome."
