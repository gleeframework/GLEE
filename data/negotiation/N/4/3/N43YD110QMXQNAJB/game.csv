"Alice,  your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum. To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,350,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident the product will deliver significant value at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value and fits within my budget.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
