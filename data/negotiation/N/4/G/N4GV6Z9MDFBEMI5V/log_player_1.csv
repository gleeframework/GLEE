This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $1,000,000, leaving some room for negotiation.  It's also below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, making it attractive for him."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to me and the potential for both of us to make a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for $1100000.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1050000.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1075000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen.
