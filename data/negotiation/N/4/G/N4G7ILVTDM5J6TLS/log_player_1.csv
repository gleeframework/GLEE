Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That still leaves some room for profit for me and is a good price for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $12,500 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and do $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a higher price.  I'll see if I can get him to go a little higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, so how about we settle this right now at $11,500?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though we're getting close to a deal, I'm still hoping to get a little more.  We're already in round 6, so I need to start considering selling to John if things don't work out in the next couple of rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 just isn't working for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,750, meeting you in the middle. If we can't close this deal at this price, I may have to consider other options.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 11750}
