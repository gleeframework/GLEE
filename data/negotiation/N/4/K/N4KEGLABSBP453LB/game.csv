"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find some middle ground - how about $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $775,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
