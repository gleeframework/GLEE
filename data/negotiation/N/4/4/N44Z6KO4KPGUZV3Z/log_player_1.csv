{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm asking for $1,200,000, a price that reflects its significant value and potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $1,000,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $800,000, so I have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be frank, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, I think I can still get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This gives us both a fair deal and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,200,000, $1,025,000 is above my minimum threshold and a decent profit.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
