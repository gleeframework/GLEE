Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that's significantly higher than John's offer, giving you room to negotiate down if needed. It's also attractive to Bob, as it's lower than the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still higher than John's offer, but it's significantly lower than my initial offer. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price slightly, hoping to meet Bob halfway. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's offer is still higher than John's offer. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
