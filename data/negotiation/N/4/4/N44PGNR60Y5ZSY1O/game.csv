"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1200000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1200000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1200000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my best offer at this time, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1050000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $900000, so I'm offering $975000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to make a bit of a concession.

"I appreciate the concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
