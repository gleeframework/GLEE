Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.
