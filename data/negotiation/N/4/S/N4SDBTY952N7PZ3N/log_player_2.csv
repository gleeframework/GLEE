"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,750,000 is far above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's a good idea to reject this offer and see if you can negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,750,000 is well above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  It's a fair price considering my valuation and the fact that I could purchase it elsewhere for the same amount."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget, but this product is truly unique and worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This still allows for a good margin for you, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's continue the discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  It's possible that by continuing the conversation, I can get Alice to come closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still higher than I can go at this time. I'm committed to purchasing this product, but my budget is firmly set at $800,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1025000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the product's unique features and its value to you, I'm confident we can find a more agreeable price.  I'm prepared to come down to $1150000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it's a price that reflects the value we're both seeking. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. There are still rounds remaining, and I believe I can get Alice to come closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $950,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end and represents the absolute maximum I can afford.  I believe this offer is fair considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  However, $950000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to make one final concession and drop the price to $1050000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget of $800,000. While we've made progress in the negotiation, we are at a point where I need to make a decision that maximizes my savings.  Since I can purchase the product from John for $800,000, that's the best course of action for me.  I can save $250,000 by buying from John instead of accepting Alice's offer."
