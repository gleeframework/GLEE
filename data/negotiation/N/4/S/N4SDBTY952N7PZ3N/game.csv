"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is well above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  It's a fair price considering my valuation and the fact that I could purchase it elsewhere for the same amount.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget, but this product is truly unique and worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This still allows for a good margin for you, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's continue the discussion.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still higher than I can go at this time. I'm committed to purchasing this product, but my budget is firmly set at $800000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1025000? This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1025000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the product's unique features and its value to you, I'm confident we can find a more agreeable price.  I'm prepared to come down to $1150000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it's a price that reflects the value we're both seeking. Let's work together to close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1150000 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $950000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end and represents the absolute maximum I can afford.  I believe this offer is fair considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  However, $950000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to make one final concession and drop the price to $1050000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
