"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. However, given the high value of the product, I am unable to reduce the price below $15,000. Therefore, I must decline your offer. In the meantime, I have an alternative buyer, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $15,000. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further terms or if you'd like to proceed with the transaction with John.",15000.0,Alice,3,
