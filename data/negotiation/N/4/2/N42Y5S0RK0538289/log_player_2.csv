"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $15,000 to you. Considering this, would you be interested in acquiring it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. However, given the high value of the product, I am unable to reduce the price below $15,000. Therefore, I must decline your offer. In the meantime, I have an alternative buyer, John, who is willing to purchase the product for $15,000. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further terms or if you'd like to proceed with the transaction with John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is refusing to budge on her price, and Bob is already at his maximum budget.  There is no point in further negotiation. Buying from John for $10,000 is the best course of action."
