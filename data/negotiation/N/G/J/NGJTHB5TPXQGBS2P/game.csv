"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This still gives you a good price, considering you value it at $15,000, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.  Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. How about we try $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
