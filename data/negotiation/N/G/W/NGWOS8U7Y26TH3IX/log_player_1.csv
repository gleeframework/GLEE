"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's always better to start with a higher price and then be willing to negotiate downwards. This gives you more room to maneuver.
* **Reasonable margin:** $150 leaves a decent profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Positive and engaging message:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and makes the offer more inviting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum threshold:**  While $120 is your minimum acceptable price,  it's worth seeing if you can secure a slightly better deal. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, you keep the negotiation open and potentially increase your earnings. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  In the next round, you can make a counteroffer closer to $120, but still slightly above your minimum threshold, to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is your maximum, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about we meet at $130? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth it."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Appeal to Value:** Emphasizing the value of the product might convince Bob to move closer to your desired price.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** A friendly and collaborative tone can keep the negotiation moving in the right direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? I think that's the sweet spot for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Accepting this offer might build rapport with Bob for future potential deals.
* **Limited Time:**  We're already in round 4, and it's not guaranteed that I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds. 

While I'd prefer $130, $125 is a good compromise and a solid outcome given the circumstances."
