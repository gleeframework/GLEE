"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $15,000. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth. It's best to counter and see if she's willing to negotiate closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to $8,000."", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a starting point that's beneficial to you.
* **Guaging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she completely rejects it, you'll know you need to move closer to her price or consider John's offer. 
* **Psychology:** By starting low, you might encourage Alice to re-evaluate her own expectations and potentially offer a more reasonable price in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $15,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $13,000 is still considerably more than your $10,000 limit and her product's worth to her ($12,000).
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice calling it her ""final offer"" at this stage is likely a negotiation tactic. It doesn't necessarily mean it's her absolute bottom line.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's space to negotiate further. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about a lower price and are willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand you think it's worth $13,000, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. I could do $9,500, but that's the absolute highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 9500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  You're increasing your offer, showing Alice you're willing to move, but you're keeping it well below her price and your limit. 
* **Firm but Fair:** The language ""absolute highest"" conveys seriousness while leaving some room for Alice to potentially counter.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge if Alice is truly unwilling to go below $12,000 (her value). If she rejects this, you might have to concede John's offer is your best option."
