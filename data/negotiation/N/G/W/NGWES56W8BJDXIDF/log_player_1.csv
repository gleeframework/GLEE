"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects my initial offer.  I'm hoping to get a good price for the product while also ensuring I'm above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $10,000.  I have 8 rounds left and I can always sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $9,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, but still leave me with a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still going to reject it. I'm willing to go down to $8,000, but I'm not going to settle for less than that. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can get him to come up to my minimum acceptable price.  I have 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $8,500. This is a further compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and we can reach a deal before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly low, and I'm running out of time. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I'm now concerned about reaching a deal before the rounds run out.  Selling to John for $8,000 ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob."
