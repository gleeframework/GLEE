"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $15,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value and my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $11,000. Accepting his offer means a $1,000 loss compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
