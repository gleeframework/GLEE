"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $1000000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $850000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $850000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. How about $800000?  This feels like a good compromise that's fair to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $825000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $825000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to land at a price closer to $800000.  I'm willing to go to $810000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value you bring to the table while also fitting within my budget. Let's close this deal at this price.",810000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, and I respect that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825000.
