,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to do $105? That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a little too low for me.  How about $110? That's a good compromise, and it gives you a great value on the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $110 is still a little out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
