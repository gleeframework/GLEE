"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate you reaching out. However, $250 is significantly higher than my budget for this product. I'm happy to consider it if you were willing to come down to $80.  I'm confident this is a fair price that would benefit us both.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 250 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for 180. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $180 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my offer of $80.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm looking for in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 180 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer it to you for 160. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping we can reach a compromise. I'm willing to pay $100 for this product, which is still significantly more than what John is offering. Let's see if we can find common ground.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that 160 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer it to you for 140. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. I'm not willing to go any lower, so let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $140 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is a significant jump from my last offer, and I think it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 140 and 120. I'm willing to offer it to you for 130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,9,
