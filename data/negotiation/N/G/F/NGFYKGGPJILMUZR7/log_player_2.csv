{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I've already spent several rounds negotiating, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to my price.  I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too high. It's better for me to buy from John for $80 and secure the product within my budget."
