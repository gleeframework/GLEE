"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's still attractive to Bob while leaving room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident Bob values the product at $150, and there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $130 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $135? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
