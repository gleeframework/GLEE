{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to him gives me leverage.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price of $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still ensuring I get significantly more than my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, maximizing the chances of a successful sale to Bob at a price significantly above my minimum."
