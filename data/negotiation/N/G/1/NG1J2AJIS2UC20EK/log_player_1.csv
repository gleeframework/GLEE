Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go higher than $8,000.  At this point, it's strategically better to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer. We avoid the risk of Bob lowballing further and wasting precious rounds."
