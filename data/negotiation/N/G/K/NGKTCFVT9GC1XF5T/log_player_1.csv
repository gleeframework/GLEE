Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000, which aligns more closely with what I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $800,000 is a fair price for the product based on my budget. I would like to stick to my original counteroffer of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly rooted at $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee further negotiation will yield a better result. It's time to take John's guaranteed offer and avoid potentially wasting more time with Bob."
