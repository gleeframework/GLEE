# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a steal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $110 is less than what Alice values the product for, you can get it for $100 from John.  Your goal is to save money, and buying from John is the most cost-effective option."
