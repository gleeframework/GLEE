Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential eagerness to acquire it.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he counters, but I have the fallback option of selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than my absolute minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and the product's value to me. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to stick with my floor price of $1,200,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, this is the minimum I can accept for the product, especially considering Bob's initial offer was lower than my initial offer. I'll see if this counteroffer is more appealing to him."
