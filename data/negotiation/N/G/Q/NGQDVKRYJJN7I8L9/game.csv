,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm interested in the product but I can only do $80 right now. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. I can meet you halfway. How about we try $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95. If we can't meet somewhere in the middle, I might have to go with another seller.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I can see that $95 is a good compromise. Let me think for a moment... Ah, I can do $105. That's as low as I can go.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $105.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $95, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,6,
