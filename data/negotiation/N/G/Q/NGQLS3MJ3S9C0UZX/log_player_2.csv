{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation to get a lower price.  Bob has a clear target of $15,000, and he shouldn't settle for anything close to that right away.  He should aim for a lower price closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,500 is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $12,000. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and aims to close the gap quickly.  It's a good starting point for a counteroffer, as it's still above Alice's value of $8,000, giving her some room to bargain."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, it's still above his desired price point.  There's still room for negotiation, and he can aim for a lower price.  He should continue to make counteroffers to try and get closer to his target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's getting closer to his desired price range, he can still try to get a lower price. He's already shown his willingness to negotiate, and it's likely Alice is also willing to compromise further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's not his ideal price, it's a significant saving compared to buying from John.  He's shown his willingness to negotiate and has gotten a good price.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or the deal falling apart. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, achieving his goal of buying the product while still staying within his budget."
