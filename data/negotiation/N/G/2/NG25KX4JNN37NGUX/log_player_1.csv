Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it allows room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of maximizing my profits. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum price and ensure I don't lose out on the deal. However, I hope to leverage Bob's potential need or desire for the product to secure a higher price."
