I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Ambition:**  I want to maximize my profit, and $950,000 is a good starting point.
* **Flexibility:** If Bob is truly interested, he may be willing to negotiate, allowing me to potentially get closer to my ideal price.
* **Safety Net:**  I have John's guaranteed offer of $800,000, providing a safety net if Bob rejects my offer. 

This approach balances the risk of losing a sale with the opportunity for a higher profit."
