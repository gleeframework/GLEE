"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you and the market demand.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire to find a middle ground, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to get close to your desired price while keeping me within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $18,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept to make the deal worthwhile for me. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",18000.0,Alice,5,
