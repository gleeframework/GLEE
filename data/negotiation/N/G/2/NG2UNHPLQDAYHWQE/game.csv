"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I'm sure will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1800000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  This is my best offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my budget.  While I value the product, I can only go up to $900000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1100000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000, which is as high as I can go.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions I've already made. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiations, but $1050000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,9,
