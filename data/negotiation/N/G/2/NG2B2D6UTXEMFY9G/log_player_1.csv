Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's really valuable, but I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180} 

**Reasoning:** 

Starting high allows room for negotiation. While $180 is more than Bob wants to spend, it's important to appear firm on the value of the product. This leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, and for me to potentially still make a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $120 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's a significant way off from my minimum acceptable price. I'm better off countering in hopes of meeting somewhere in the middle. There's still a chance to negotiate a price closer to my minimum before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate your perspective on the value. I could come down a bit to $160. That's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counter-offer shows willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above my minimum price and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""quality"" of the product, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its inherent value, hoping to nudge him closer to my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $140 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could try to negotiate for a bit more, it's unlikely Bob will move much higher. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
