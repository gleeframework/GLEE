Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. I can offer it to you for $12,000, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. This is my last serious offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is going in circles and seems unwilling to budge closer to a reasonable price. She's now trying to repackage the same offer with ""extras"" after already stating a ""final concession"". It's unlikely she'll move much further from her $12,000 price point.  It's time to cut losses and buy from John for $15,000."
