"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a little high for me.  I'm really aiming to stay under $9,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,100?  This would be a great compromise and let us both walk away feeling good about the deal.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,150. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9150.0,Alice,7,
