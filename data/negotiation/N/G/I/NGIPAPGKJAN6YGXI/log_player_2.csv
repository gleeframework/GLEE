Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can still potentially get it for a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  If he rejects, he can offer a slightly higher price and may reach a mutually agreeable price point before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has already rejected two counteroffers and Alice has stated it's her final offer.  While he would prefer a lower price, it's still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  He is able to save $3,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
