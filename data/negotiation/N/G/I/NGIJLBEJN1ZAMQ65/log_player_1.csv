Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is significantly higher than what I would get from John, but it still leaves room for negotiation with Bob, allowing for a potential higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired range.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I still believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $1,400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer is still lower than I'd like, it's only slightly lower than what I'd get from John.  It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
