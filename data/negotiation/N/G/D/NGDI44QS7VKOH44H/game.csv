"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would give you a significant value and allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering you $1,300,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but $1,300,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum needs.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,325,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.  Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $1,325,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $1,300,000.  This is a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
