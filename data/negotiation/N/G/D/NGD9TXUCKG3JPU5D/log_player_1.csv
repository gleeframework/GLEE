"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its true value.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and makes Bob feel like there's potential for a good deal.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the unique value of the product to make it more desirable.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being shut down. 

**Note:** This is just my initial strategy. I'll adapt my offers based on Bob's responses and how many rounds are left. If Bob doesn't seem interested in my initial offer, I'll consider lowering the price, but I'll always aim for the highest price possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer is a safer bet:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is more than Bob's offer. However, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet.
* **Negotiation room:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering Bob.

I will counter-offer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. If he continues to offer significantly less, I'll consider selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but it's below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving towards John's offer:** I'm lowering the price to $1,750,000, which is closer to John's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing the compromise:** I'm highlighting that this is a considerable reduction from my initial offer, showcasing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Keeping pressure on:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counter-offer again, but my message implies that further reductions might not be possible.

I'm aiming to see if I can reach a compromise with Bob in this round. If he still refuses to meet my price, I'll be more inclined to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,600,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is almost there:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a very close match to my minimum.
* **Few rounds left:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be cautious about potentially wasting time on negotiations that may not lead to a favorable outcome.

I'm going to counter-offer Bob again in the next round, but I'll be firm in my price. If he still refuses to meet my minimum, I'll likely sell to John in the subsequent round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,600,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to go as low as $1,550,000.  This is a final compromise from my side. If you're serious about buying, this is our last chance to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or move on.
* **Minimal reduction:** I'm only lowering the price by $50,000 from my previous offer, showing a firm stance.
* **Appealing to urgency:** I'm reminding Bob that the negotiation is nearing its end and he might lose the opportunity.

This is my last attempt to get Bob to accept a price closer to my minimum. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1520000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 6, with only 4 rounds remaining. This means we are getting closer to the end of the negotiation window. 
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While his offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is safe:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which meets my minimum requirement. 

Given these factors, I believe it's best to sell to John now. There is a risk that Bob might eventually meet my price, but it's not worth risking losing a guaranteed $1,500,000 with limited rounds remaining."
