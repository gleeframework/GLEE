"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? I'm confident this is a fair price given the value of the product to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
