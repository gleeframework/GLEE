"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $725,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $725,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $680,000.  Would you be open to that?",680000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $680,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $710,000. This is a reasonable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",710000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting closer. To make this work for me, I need to be around $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $715,000. This is a small adjustment from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,7,
