"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value to me, while also allowing you to make a profit.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me considering the product's potential.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this price is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a good profit on the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,
