"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a maximum of $15,000 to spend, a counteroffer is worth trying.  You can aim for a price closer to your limit, but be prepared to potentially end up paying more than $10,000 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  I'm trying to get a good deal, but also want to avoid a situation where Alice simply rejects the offer and I'm left with no options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down a bit, but it's still a bit more than I want to pay. I'm going to try to get the price even lower with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $8,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a price I'm comfortable with. Hopefully, she'll accept this offer."
