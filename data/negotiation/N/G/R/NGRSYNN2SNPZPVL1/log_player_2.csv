# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a little bit over budget.  How about $132? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the profit margin I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $134. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $134. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $134
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $134, which is just $4 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $130.  At this point, it's a good deal for Bob.  He's getting the product for less than John's $150 and only $4 more than his ideal price.  It's time to close the deal."
