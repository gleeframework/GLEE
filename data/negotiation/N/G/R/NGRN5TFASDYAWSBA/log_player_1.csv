I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than my initial offer, but it also gives me some breathing room and allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous one, and it's closer to my desired price point. Given that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good outcome."
