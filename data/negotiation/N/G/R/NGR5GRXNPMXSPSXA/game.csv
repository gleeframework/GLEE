"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this to me.  While I see the potential,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $950,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
