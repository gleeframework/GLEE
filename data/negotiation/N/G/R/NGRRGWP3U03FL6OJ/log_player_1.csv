Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a lot to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the immense value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does staying within my budget. I can increase my offer slightly, but $1,900,000 is still too high. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is inching up, but we're still very far apart.  It's too early to settle for his offer, and John's guaranteed $1,500,000 keeps us safe. Let's see if we can draw Bob out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to own this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for clarifying the situation.  While $1,300,000 is closer to where I'd need to be, it's still a significant jump. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as my final offer.  I understand this might not meet your initial expectations, but I believe it's a fair offer given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but it's time to cut our losses. Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is his absolute limit, which is still significantly below our minimum. While we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of him, it's unlikely to be a substantial increase that would justify continuing the negotiation. John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
