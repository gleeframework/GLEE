"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to accept such a high price at this stage.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  I'm not willing to accept it yet, but I'm optimistic that we can continue to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000.  I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. To make this work, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000.  This is my best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still too high for me. While she's shown a willingness to negotiate, I'm concerned that we're nearing the end of the allotted rounds and I don't want to risk missing out on a deal with John. At this point, it's safer and more financially sensible to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000."
