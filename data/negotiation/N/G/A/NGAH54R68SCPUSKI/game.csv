"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000.  I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. To make this work, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000.  This is my best offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
