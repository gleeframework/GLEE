{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, while still securing a substantial profit margin.
* **Justification for price:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""potential return on investment"" aims to justify the high price tag in Bob's mind, even though he might not value it as highly as you do.

By offering the product at $1,300,000, Alice aims to maximize her profit while still giving Bob a (small) incentive to buy it immediately instead of risking losing the deal."
