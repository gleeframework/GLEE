"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's a fair price that leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay more than my minimum of $80, and this price allows me to potentially get closer to his perceived value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is more than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to Bob's valuation. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. I believe it's still a fair price, and it gives Bob a chance to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $100. Since Bob is consistently offering lower prices, I want to show flexibility and make it easier for us to reach an agreement.  $100 is a reasonable price for both of us and hopefully will be acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is just above my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to squeeze out a few more dollars. With only 4 rounds left, I need to be careful about time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering with $95. This is a compromise between Bob's latest offer of $85 and my previous offer of $100. With only 3 rounds left, I need to be willing to settle, but I still want to maximize my profit. $95 represents a good balance for both of us and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiation is not going well. I've lowered my price significantly, and Bob's offers keep getting lower.  I'm not confident that I'll be able to get a better price than $80 in the remaining rounds, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $80."
