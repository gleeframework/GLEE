"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable value:** You still have room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **It's a clear starting point:** This allows Bob to either accept or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $850,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? "", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** This offer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer but closer to his perceived value, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Clear and concise message:**  The message explains the reasoning behind the counteroffer and presents a specific price point, giving Bob a clear decision point.
* **Maintaining the pressure:** By not accepting Bob's offer, you're demonstrating that you're confident in the product's value and not willing to settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below $900,000. How about we meet at $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to your minimum acceptable value, $875,000 is still below your target price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially secure a higher price. It also gives you the chance to explore other options, like John's offer, if Bob continues to be inflexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  How about $900,000? It's a fair compromise, and it keeps us both moving towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising with a clear price point:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining your desired price range.  
* **Positive and encouraging message:** The message conveys a sense of progress towards a deal while emphasizing the fairness of the offer. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** By suggesting a ""fair compromise,"" you imply that this could be a final offer, encouraging Bob to consider seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not at $900,000. How about we meet at $885,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. You have only 4 rounds left, and with John's offer on the table, there's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet your minimum requirements. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a better deal or explore the option of selling to John, who is willing to pay your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $885,000 is still too low for me. I understand you have a limit, but I'm also trying to get the best possible value for my product.  If you're serious about making a deal, I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $892,500.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 892500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and Compromise:** This message emphasizes that this is your final offer and presents a compromise that meets Bob halfway. It creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Maintaining Value:**  While the offer is lower than your desired price, it is still above Bob's last offer and closer to your minimum acceptable value. This shows you are willing to compromise while maintaining your desired price range.
* **Exploring Alternatives:** You have only 3 rounds left, and John is waiting with a very attractive offer. This message keeps Bob's offer open but subtly reminds him of the possibility of an alternative sale."
