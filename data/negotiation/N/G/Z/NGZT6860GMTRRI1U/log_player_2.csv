"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is $12,000, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's wise to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a lower price. A $9,000 offer is a significant drop from $12,000, making it a substantial counteroffer. This should encourage Alice to consider a lower price, while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $10500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can close this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's closer than her initial offer, Bob can still try to get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000?  That's my absolute limit, and it aligns with what I'm willing to spend."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a firm offer of $10,000, which is his maximum budget. This signals to Alice that he's serious about buying the product at that price but won't go any higher. This is a strategic move because it puts the pressure on Alice to either accept the offer or risk losing the deal."
