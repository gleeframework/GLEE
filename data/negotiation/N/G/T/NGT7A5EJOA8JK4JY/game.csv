"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $8,200 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $7,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
