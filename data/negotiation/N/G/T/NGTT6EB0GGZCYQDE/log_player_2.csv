While $875,000 is a good price, it's still above my target.  I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We're running out of rounds and Alice isn't budging much. While I'd prefer a lower price, $880,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000 price.  I'll take it and close the deal."
