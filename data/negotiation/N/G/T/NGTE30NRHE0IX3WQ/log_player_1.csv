"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, offering $100 gives him a good deal, and it's a strong starting point for me to try and maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than $80 from John, I'm holding out for a better deal. Bob clearly values the product and is willing to negotiate, so I'm going to counter his offer and try to squeeze a bit more out of this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
