Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By initially offering the product at $15,000, Alice leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than her minimum acceptable amount ($10,000). 
* **Justification:**  Alice provides a brief justification (""Given its value..."") to make the higher price seem reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests  Alice is open to hearing Bob's thoughts, implying potential flexibility in the price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While $10,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he believes the product is difficult to find elsewhere or if he highly values a quick purchase.
* **John as a Backup:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept an offer below her minimum. This allows her to be bolder in her initial ask to Bob."
