"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $13,000.  I think it would be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than the $15,000 John is charging, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to quickly establish a lower price point. He's offering $2,000 less than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating his serious interest while aiming for a price that's closer to his ideal range. This counteroffer gives Alice space to bargain without immediately resorting to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $12,000 is closer to his goal, he can likely still get a better deal.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating, potentially getting a price closer to his $11,000 counteroffer.  There are still several rounds remaining, and he doesn't want to rush into a decision that might leave him feeling he could have gotten a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a compromise by increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to negotiate.  The $11,500 price is still within his budget and demonstrates his commitment to getting a deal. This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to make a decision, as he's moving closer to her offer."
