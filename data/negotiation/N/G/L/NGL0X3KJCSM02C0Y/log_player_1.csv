{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves room for negotiation without immediately making me feel like I need to sell to John.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making it more appealing.

**Note:**  This is just the initial offer. I'll need to assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I need to get.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" fallback:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'd rather try to get closer to my desired price. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal, but still taking into account Bob's willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? This would allow us both to get a good deal, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and demonstrates that I'm taking his offer seriously.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, hoping to emphasize the benefits of a deal at this price point. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to carefully consider whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum requirement of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While the negotiations are getting closer to my ideal, I still believe there's potential to reach a price that's more favorable to me. 
* **Avoiding the ""John"" fallback:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to both of us."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I need.
* **Time is money:**  The negotiation is becoming protracted, and I'm concerned about wasting more time with Bob.
* **Guarantee my minimum:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired minimum and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 

While I'd prefer to reach a higher price with Bob, the potential gains from further negotiation are unlikely to outweigh the certainty and efficiency of selling to John."
