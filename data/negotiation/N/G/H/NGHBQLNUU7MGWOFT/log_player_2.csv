**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **You can still save money:** Even though you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000), you're saving $300,000 compared to buying from John."
