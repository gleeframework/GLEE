"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $175 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows the product is worth $100 to him, so he starts by offering the minimum possible price. This is a bold move, but it establishes Bob's firm stance and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  Bob is committed to saving as much as possible and knows he has other options.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay more than his initial offer, but only a small amount.  He's testing the waters, seeing if Alice is willing to come down further from her $160 offer. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while showing Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob is willing to pay $110 (his last counteroffer), and there's room for both parties to meet in the middle.  Continuing to negotiate has the potential to get Bob a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise. $120 is a midpoint between his last offer and Alice's latest proposal, creating a potential meeting ground. This move indicates Bob is serious about reaching a deal but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and Bob has already gone up to $120.  With only 3 rounds left, there is not enough time to negotiate further.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John at his guaranteed price of $100. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
