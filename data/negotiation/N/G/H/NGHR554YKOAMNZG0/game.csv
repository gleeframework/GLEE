"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise that still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be at least at $1,200,000. This would give us both a good outcome and I wouldn't have to involve a third party. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
