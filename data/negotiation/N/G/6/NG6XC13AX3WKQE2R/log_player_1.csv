Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, what do you say?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Value:** Knowing Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice needs to offer a price that's attractive but leaves room for profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering a price too close to $8,000 minimizes potential profit. A price too close to $10,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer.
* **The ""One-Time Offer"":** Creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly.

By offering the product at $9,500, Alice aims to secure a $1,500 profit while still making the deal appealing to Bob."
