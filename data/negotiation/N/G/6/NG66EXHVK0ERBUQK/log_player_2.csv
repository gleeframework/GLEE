{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since you are aiming to get the product for less than $100, rejecting her offer and counter-offering is the better strategy."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her value for the product.

* **Focus on Value:**  The message reinforces your understanding of the product's value, which is important for building trust."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but $90 is still above my target of under $100. It's worth continuing to negotiate, aiming for a lower price.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm still pushing for a price under $90, but I'm also showing willingness to compromise.

* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone is important to keep the negotiation going."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but $89 is still above my goal of under $100. I'm not in a hurry, so I'll continue to negotiate in hopes of getting a slightly lower price.  While I could accept and pay $89, there's a chance I can still get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $89 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $88. This seems like a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by increasing my offer. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair price, considering both our perspectives.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly increasing the pressure by mentioning the need to reach an agreement."
