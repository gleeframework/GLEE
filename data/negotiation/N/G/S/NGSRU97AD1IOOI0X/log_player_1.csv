Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have John as a backup buyer at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, which means getting as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.  However, you need to leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal to incentivize him to accept. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Positioning:**  The message frames the offer as exclusive and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Price Justification:**  You're not just throwing a number out there. You're implying that the price is based on the product's worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While your asking price is $1,400,000, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer. This gives you some wiggle room to still stay above your minimum.

**Important Notes:**

* **Confidence is Key:** Present your offer with confidence. If you seem unsure, Bob might sense hesitation and lowball you further.
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob tries to negotiate you down too low, be prepared to walk away and sell to John. Your bottom line is protected. 

Let me know if you'd like to explore alternative scenarios or refine this offer further!"
