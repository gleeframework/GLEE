"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's within a reasonable range for a product of this value. If Bob accepts, great! If not, it gives us room to negotiate and gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for the absolute minimum. I believe there's room for a better deal, and I'll use the remaining rounds to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I want to see if we can meet in the middle,  and I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to accept it.  While John offers a safe option at $1,200,000, I still believe there's potential to get a better price from Bob.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping that this shows my willingness to negotiate, and that we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiations with Bob have stalled.  His offers are continuing to go down, and I don't believe we're going to find a price that's acceptable to both of us.  It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer, which is still a good deal for me."
