Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $190. I believe it's a steal at this price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 190
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation downwards, if needed, without going below your minimum.
* **Anchoring:** By offering a high initial price, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he rejects the initial price, his counter-offer is likely to be higher than if you started low.
* **Confidence:** Offering a high price with confidence can sometimes convince buyers of the product's premium nature, even without further justification.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or price sensitivity. 
* If you learn Bob is very price-sensitive, you might adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds.
* Be prepared to justify the high price if Bob asks, but avoid sounding desperate."
