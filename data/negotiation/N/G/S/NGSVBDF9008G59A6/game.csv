"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your goal is to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still benefits both of us.
