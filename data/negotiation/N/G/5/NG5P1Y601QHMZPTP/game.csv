"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,075,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal.  This product has significant value, as I'm sure you recognize. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome.",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,110,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1090000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on this.  The value this product offers is significant, and I'm confident in my pricing.  To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, which is the lowest I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
