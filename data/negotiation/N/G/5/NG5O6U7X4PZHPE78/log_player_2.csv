"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. I can go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant compromise and a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go down to $12,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
