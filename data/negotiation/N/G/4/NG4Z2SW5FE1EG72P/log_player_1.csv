Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a chance to consider the product while still providing me with a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $20,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $18,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,500 is a good compromise and still significantly higher than my minimum.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us."
