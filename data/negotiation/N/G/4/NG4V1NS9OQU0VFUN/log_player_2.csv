"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** She's offering it for $12,000.
* **John's Price:** John is selling it for $15,000.

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $3,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price."
