"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $7,500, I can do better. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above what I would get from John. It's important to remember that negotiation is a two-way street.  I've gotten a decent price for the product, and Bob is happy with the deal."
