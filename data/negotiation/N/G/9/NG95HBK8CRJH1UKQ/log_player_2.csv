Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your financial constraints and am willing to adjust my offer slightly. I propose a price of $12750 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product to you and my desired selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $750 above Bob's ideal price of $12,000. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's unlikely that Bob can negotiate a significantly lower price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product at a reasonable price and still leave some room for potential negotiation in the future."
