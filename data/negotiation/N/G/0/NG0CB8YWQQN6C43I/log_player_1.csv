Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation, potentially leading to a quicker sale. 

**Important Note:** While you have a backup buyer, it's generally good practice to try and secure the best possible deal with the first potential buyer."
