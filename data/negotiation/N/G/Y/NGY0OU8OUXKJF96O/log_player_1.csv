"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening that sets the bar high and allows for room to negotiate.  I believe it's a good balance between maximizing potential profit and leaving room for a deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. 

I've tried my best to negotiate with Bob, but it seems we can't come to an agreement.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not confident that we can close the deal with Bob within the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale now than risk losing everything."
