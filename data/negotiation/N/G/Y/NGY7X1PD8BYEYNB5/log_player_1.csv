"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale. I'm looking to get $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate if necessary.  I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic in my message, hoping to build a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is above my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I would like to propose $90 as my maximum bid for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my target price of $100, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation. Accepting this offer seems like the best option to maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of a stalemate."
