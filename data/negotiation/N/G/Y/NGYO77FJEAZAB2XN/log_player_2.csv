# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is very close to my maximum price. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows me to explore if I can get it for closer to $900,000."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $920,000 is still higher than my target. I want to see if I can push her closer to my initial counteroffer of $900,000.  There are still several rounds left, and I have the option of going to John if negotiations stall."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 910000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $915000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $910,000, and it's within my acceptable price range.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely or ending up with a worse price. At this point, I'm comfortable accepting her offer and securing the product."
