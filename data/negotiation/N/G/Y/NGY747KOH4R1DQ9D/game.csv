"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I see the value in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference - how about $900,000? I'm confident this product will bring you significant returns, and this price reflects that value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant concession. This price reflects the value you'll gain from this product. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
