"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I see the value in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($600,000) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. This tactic aims to understand Alice's flexibility and establish a lower baseline for the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** My maximum budget is $800,000, and John offers the product at that price.  By starting low, I have room to increase my offer if needed while staying below my absolute limit.
* **Gauge Reaction:** This counteroffer will help me gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. Her response will reveal if she's open to a deal significantly lower than her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference - how about $900,000? I'm confident this product will bring you significant returns, and this price reflects that value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, but Staying Strategic:** I'm increasing my offer to $750,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying below my maximum budget and John's offer.
* **Finding the Middle Ground:** By suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offers, I'm aiming for a solution that feels balanced and fair to both parties.
* **Limited Time:**  We are approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, so proposing a price closer to my target range becomes more critical. 
* **Backup Option:**  Having John's offer in my back pocket keeps me from feeling pressured to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant concession. This price reflects the value you'll gain from this product. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has come down slightly, but her latest offer is still above my maximum budget and John's offer.  It seems unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Time is running out:**  With half the rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate with Alice risks reaching an impasse and missing out on a better deal.
* **Guaranteed savings:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, saving me $50,000 compared to Alice's current offer.

It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with from John."
