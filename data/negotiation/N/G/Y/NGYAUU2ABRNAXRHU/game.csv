"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit above your budget. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into creating it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product for $10,900.
