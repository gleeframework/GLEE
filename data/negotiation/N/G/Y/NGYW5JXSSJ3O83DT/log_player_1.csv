Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards if Bob counters.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:**  While Alice has a guaranteed $10,000 offer, she doesn't want to appear too eager to sell to Bob. This could lead him to lowball her.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message frames the price as reflecting the product's value, not just an arbitrary number. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
