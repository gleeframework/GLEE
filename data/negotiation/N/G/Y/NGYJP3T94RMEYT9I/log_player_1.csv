Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given my valuation, $1,200,000 seems more reasonable.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $1,300,000 is a good profit. It's best to accept the offer now and secure a favorable deal."
