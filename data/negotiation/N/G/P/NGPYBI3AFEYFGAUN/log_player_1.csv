Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation but is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Leaving Room:** This price is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
