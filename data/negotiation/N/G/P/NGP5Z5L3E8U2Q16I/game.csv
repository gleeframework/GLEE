"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,700,000.  This price reflects the product's worth while still being within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $2,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,700,000.  This price is fair and reflects the value we both see in the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
