Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. I need to offer a price that is attractive enough for him to consider but still leaves me with a profit.
* **My Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer, John, who will pay $1,000,000. This gives me leverage.
* **The Offer:** $900,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than Bob's value, but still leaves me with a profit of $100,000, which is better than selling to John. 

**Potential Outcome:**

* **Bob accepts:** I make $900,000.
* **Bob rejects:** I sell to John for $1,000,000. 

This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob."
