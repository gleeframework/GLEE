Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $700,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While that's closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we try a price of $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer that considers the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but $1,200,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  Considering your final offer, I'd be willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,000,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** $1,000,000 is a considerable profit margin, even if it's less than my ideal price. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital available for other investments or opportunities.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging negotiations out further could lead to Bob walking away entirely.

Accepting $1,000,000 now balances risk and reward effectively."
