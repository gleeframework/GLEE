"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet at $180? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $160, but that's as low as I can go. I really like the product and I'm willing to make a deal.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $160, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $170? I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $170 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $165, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to get a bit worried that I might have to go to John's store and buy it for $120 instead.",165.0,Bob,6,
