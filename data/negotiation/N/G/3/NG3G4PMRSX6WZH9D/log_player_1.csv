Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you start with a price significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely mentions ""value and potential"" to pique Bob's interest without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and invites Bob's feedback, signaling your willingness to negotiate. 

By starting high, you aim to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a deal above your guaranteed price."
