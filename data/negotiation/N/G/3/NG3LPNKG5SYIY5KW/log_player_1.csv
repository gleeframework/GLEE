Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value and features,"" Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her true bottom line.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and keeps the negotiation open.

While $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's a strong opening move for Alice. If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has the security of John's $15,000 offer and can always counter Bob's rejection with a lower price, still aiming to maximize her profit."
