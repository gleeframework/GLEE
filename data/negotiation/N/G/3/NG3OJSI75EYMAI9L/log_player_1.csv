"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both agree on. Let's work together to close this deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, taking anything less than $12,000 would be selling myself short.  However, I do want to make this work. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my absolute lowest price. This is a great deal on a product you'll love.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up to $9,800. This is really stretching my budget, but I believe in the value of this product. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it's clear he's unlikely to reach $10,000. I'd rather take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk Bob walking away in the next two rounds."
