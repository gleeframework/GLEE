"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly below the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000). While it's a good deal, there's potential to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to his target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to pay a bit closer to the value I see in this product. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This is still a significant gain for you and allows me to secure this asset without overspending. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to let go of the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000 and still a profitable deal for Alice. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price while avoiding further negotiation rounds."
