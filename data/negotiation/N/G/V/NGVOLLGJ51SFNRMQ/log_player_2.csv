"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price.**  You can make a counteroffer and potentially save some money.

**Next Steps:**

You should now make a counteroffer to Alice.  A good starting point would be to offer a price closer to your maximum, but still below what you're willing to pay."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While she's lowered the price slightly, it's still above what you're willing to pay. 
* **You still have room to negotiate.** You can make another counteroffer and potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

You should now make another counteroffer to Alice. Since she's willing to compromise, you can try to meet her halfway again, but propose a price slightly lower than $13,000. You could offer $11,500 or $12,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my costs and my target profit. How about $13,500? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum but is still above your preferred price.** At this point, you've already made a couple of counteroffers, and Alice seems unwilling to go lower. 
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.** You might end up in a stalemate with Alice, and you don't want to risk losing time and potentially missing out on the product altogether.

**Next Steps:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, it's best to buy it from John at that price. While it's not the ideal price, it ensures you get the product without further negotiation and potential delays."
