"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. How about we start with a price of $100? I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is decent, but there's room for negotiation. We have time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product looks great, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We're starting with a reasonably lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility. It's a good opening for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I think the product's value is worth more than $80. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better, we're still early in the negotiation. Let's see if we can push a little further down without being unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $88? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 88
}
```

We're inching closer to a price that works for us. This offer shows we're willing to compromise but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I still think the product's value is worth more than $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $88. How about we try $91.50? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly anchoring on the higher end, and $91.50 is a reasonable compromise. We've saved a decent amount, and it's not worth risking losing the deal for a few more dollars, especially with John's offer at $120."
