Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll be interested in. My asking price is $180. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $160 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $160 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $170. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 170}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $170, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $165? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While $165 is still a bit below what I initially wanted, it's getting closer to my minimum and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing both Bob and John."
