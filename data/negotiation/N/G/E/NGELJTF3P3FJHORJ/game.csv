"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. Given its value, I'm offering it at $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $5,000.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is my best offer, as I know I could sell it for a similar price elsewhere.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $19,000 is still too far out of my price range.  Would you consider $7,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, I'm a little disappointed you can't meet the $19,000.  However, to show I'm flexible, I'd be willing to accept $14,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's more than fair.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're making an effort to find a middle ground, and I respect that.  While $14,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. Hopefully, this brings us closer to a deal we can both agree on.",7500.0,Bob,6,
