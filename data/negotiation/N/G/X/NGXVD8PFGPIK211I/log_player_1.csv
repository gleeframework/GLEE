"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This sets a strong initial position, but also leaves room for negotiation.  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and I can then gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $900,000. This is still a significant price, but it's a compromise from my initial offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to accept it. I'm going to try to get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate while being just above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with an even lower price. It's time to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $800,000."
