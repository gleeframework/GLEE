Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $8,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate.  $19,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm aiming to make this a win-win. How about we settle at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground. However, $16,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer in very small increments. It seems unlikely he will reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $15,000 within the remaining rounds. Cutting my losses and taking John's offer ensures I get a fair price for the product."
