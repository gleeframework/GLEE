"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $8,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate.  $19,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm aiming to make this a win-win. How about we settle at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground. However, $16,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
