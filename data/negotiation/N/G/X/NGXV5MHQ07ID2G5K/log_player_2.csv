"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high ($22,000) compared to my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's essential to negotiate and see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'll reject the offer and counter with a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $8,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $19,000 is still too high for my budget.  While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still far from a price I'm comfortable with.  I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate.  $19,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm aiming to make this a win-win. How about we settle at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm committed to staying within my maximum of $8,000.  I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground. However, $16,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
