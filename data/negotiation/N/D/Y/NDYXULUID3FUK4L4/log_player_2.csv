It's worth negotiating with Alice. $900,000 is still a hefty price, and you can likely get it lower."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows my intention to negotiate and sets the stage for a potential compromise."

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $850,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

While $825,000 is getting closer, it's still above my ideal price range. I want to see if I can push for a lower offer before resorting to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}

Alice's offer of $800,000 is very close to my ideal price range and the product's value to her. Accepting this offer secures the purchase at a good price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation or the higher price from John."
