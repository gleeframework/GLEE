Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive and won't be available for long."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, attempting to sell to Bob first allows me to potentially earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin for me while still presenting a compelling discount to Bob. This price is significantly lower than my minimum but still much higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By emphasizing that the offer is time-sensitive and exclusive, I hope to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid further negotiation."
