"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to reach my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already made my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. I'm not going to keep negotiating at a price that's below my minimum.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
