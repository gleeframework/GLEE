{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This is a strategic starting point to give Bob room to negotiate while still securing a good profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and informative, highlighting the value proposition for Bob while also leaving room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also want to avoid a protracted negotiation that could lead to a counteroffer from Bob that I might be forced to reject. By starting at $1,200,000, I am giving Bob a chance to accept a profitable deal for him while leaving myself room to negotiate if he counteroffers. I can then adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (which I can secure from John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a low price. This will encourage Bob to raise his offer in the next round. I will make a counteroffer that is still above Bob's current offer, but closer to my target price, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below what I'm hoping to achieve. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've counter-offered with a price of $1,050,000. This is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is  positive and constructive, reiterating my commitment to reaching an agreement. It also highlights the fairness of the new offer and emphasizes the mutual benefit of a deal.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. This strategy aims to encourage Bob to accept the counteroffer and avoid further rounds of negotiation. However, if he rejects again, I will be prepared to adjust my counteroffer strategically, keeping my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (from John) in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I am confident that I can continue to negotiate with Bob and secure a better deal.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I am not willing to settle for a low price. This will encourage Bob to raise his offer further. I will make a counteroffer that is still above Bob's current offer, but closer to my target price, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable deal. I am prepared to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer, and it would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $1,000,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** The message remains positive and emphasizes the fairness of the new offer.  It also underscores the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's last offer, I hope to encourage him to see the potential for a deal. This strategy aims to reach a compromise without sacrificing too much of my profit. If Bob rejects again, I will consider my options, including selling to John for $1,500,000. I am willing to negotiate with Bob for a few more rounds, but my minimum acceptable price remains $1,500,000."
