"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can offer it to you for $11000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really committed to getting this product, but I can only go up to $9000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really keen on getting this product, but my absolute ceiling is $9500. Would you be willing to come down a little further?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $10000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I really appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to getting this product, but I can only go up to $9750.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this point.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9750 is getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $9800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your persistence, but $9800 is unfortunately still out of my budget.  If you're willing to come down to $9700, I'm ready to make the purchase. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other options. ",9700.0,Bob,10,
