{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $12,000 is better than buying from John for $15,000. You save $3,000. 
* While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower. Accepting her offer is the most rational choice to get the product within your budget and maximize your savings."
