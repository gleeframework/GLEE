{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still making a profit. I'm also framing it positively to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm rejecting his offer to see if I can get him to pay closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand $120 is your price point, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum, Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a prolonged process, it's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
