{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its potential return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While John provides a $1,000,000 safety net, Bob values the product significantly higher. This presents an opportunity to negotiate a price closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and focusing on the ""value"" and ""potential return on investment"" aims to justify the high price to Bob.

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing the best possible deal with Bob and ensuring the product is sold at a price exceeding my minimum requirement."
