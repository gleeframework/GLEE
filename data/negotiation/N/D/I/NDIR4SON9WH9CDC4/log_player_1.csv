This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than my minimum value, allowing for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget and need to get the best deal possible. Is there any wiggle room in your price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even lower than my initial offer. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a deal that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $8,200 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a deal that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
