Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $10,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting at your desired price allows you to gauge Bob's interest. He might be willing to pay the full amount. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you still have the option to negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $9,500) before going to John. 

By opening high, you maximize your potential earnings while still leaving room to secure a deal with Bob."
