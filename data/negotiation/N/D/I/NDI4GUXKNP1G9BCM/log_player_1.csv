"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,050,000.  This offer represents a fair compromise."",

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, and we have room to negotiate. Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting close to a deal. I'm willing to increase my offer to $990,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

We're getting very close, but with 4 rounds left, we can push for a bit more. Bob increasing his offer in two consecutive rounds indicates strong interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I appreciate that. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

This message conveys a few things:
* **Firmness:**  By stating ""final offer,"" we're letting Bob know this is it. 
* **Compromise:** We're moving closer to his range, indicating willingness to deal.
* **Clean Number:** $1,000,000 is psychologically appealing and easy to agree on. 

This strategy aims to secure a strong deal without dragging negotiations further."
