Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum ($80) but still lower than Bob's perceived value ($150). 
* **Justifying the price:** I'm framing the offer as fair and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to counteroffer if he wishes. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while staying open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. Bob has shown interest and acknowledged the product's value, so a slight counteroffer is likely to be successful. I will try to reach a price closer to my target of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while proposing a compromise at $110, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price for both parties and highlighting the profit I'd make to justify the offer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob."
