Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob values the product even slightly more than his initial estimate. This price gives me a significant profit over my minimum and leaves Bob with a potential bargain.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is framed positively and leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price slightly high."
