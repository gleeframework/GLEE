"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I think it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $120 for the product. This offers a fair compromise between its value to you and my need to recoup its cost. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no need to pay $120."
