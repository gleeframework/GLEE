"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems a bit high to me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 falls quite short of what I can agree to.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and as low as I can go.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I need to consider other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
