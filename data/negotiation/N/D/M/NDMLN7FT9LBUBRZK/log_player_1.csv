Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $90."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $100, so aiming high initially allows you to potentially get the maximum profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Secure a Good Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 from John, so you're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This approach balances risk and reward, giving you the best chance to get the highest possible price."
