,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still think the product is worth more than that.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still think the product is worth a bit more than $100. How about we meet at $105? I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think this is the lowest I can go.",105.0,Alice,5,
