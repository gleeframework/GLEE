"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $10000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's my absolute limit.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I need a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? It's a great price, and I think you'll love the product!",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really serious about this, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9250? It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product!",9250.0,Alice,7,
