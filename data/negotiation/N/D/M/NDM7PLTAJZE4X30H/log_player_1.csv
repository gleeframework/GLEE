Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm offering it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

This is a classic negotiation strategy starting with an ""anchoring"" price high above your minimum.  Even though it's much higher than Bob's perceived value, it gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit significantly above your $8,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my initial asking price. Bob's offer indicates he's interested, so I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows Willingness to Negotiate:** By coming down from $12,000 to $10,000,  I signal that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Still Aims for a Strong Profit:** $10,000 is a significant profit margin above my $8,000 minimum. 
* **Middle Ground:**  It positions the offer as a fair compromise, hopefully enticing Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but $10,000 is out of my budget. Let's try $9,000. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly very interested in the product but also has a firm budget. Accepting $9,000 is a good deal â€“ it's a solid profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation pushing the price down or losing him as a buyer entirely."
