"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1600000. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1520000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1520000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1480000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1480000.0,Bob,6,
