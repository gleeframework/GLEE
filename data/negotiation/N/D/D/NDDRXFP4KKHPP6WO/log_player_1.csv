"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $200, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I was hoping to keep the price within my budget. Would you consider $150 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can do better. Bob is clearly interested, and by rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $150 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $175?  It's a fair price for both of us and lets us both walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to go up to $160 for the product. Is that a possibility? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $160, which is closer to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that he might walk away entirely.  $160 is a good deal, and I'm comfortable accepting it to avoid the potential of losing this sale."
