While $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a better price. I believe there's still room for him to increase his offer."

Bob's offer of $915,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with a price lower than what John is offering. It's time to secure the deal with John and guarantee a profit."
