Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which I believe reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
