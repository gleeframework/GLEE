"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which I believe reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I understand the product's worth, but I'm sticking to my offer of $750,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much value. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I can justify.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $825,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,6,
