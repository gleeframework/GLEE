"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise, I think.",97.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $97. How about we try $102? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
