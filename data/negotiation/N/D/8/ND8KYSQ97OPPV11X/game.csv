"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting it for a significant discount, and I'll still be making a good profit.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $950,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,
