"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you than that.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your asking price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $950,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $925,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
