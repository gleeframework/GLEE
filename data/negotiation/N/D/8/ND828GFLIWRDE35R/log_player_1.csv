Round 2
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about $100? That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 100}

I'll reject Bob's offer. $92 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
