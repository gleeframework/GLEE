"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $160?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $160 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $175?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
