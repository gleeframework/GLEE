""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value, I'm setting the initial price at $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product is impressive, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,300,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the immense benefits this product offers."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still drastically undervaluing the product. While his offer is increasing, we're still in a range where it makes more sense to negotiate firmly.  We're early enough in the rounds to hold our ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $650,000 is still a significant gap from where I see the value. This product is truly one-of-a-kind. To move this forward, I could consider $1,100,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing your willingness to find a compromise here.  To show you I'm serious, I can go up to $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly willing to move on price, but we're still at a point where we have room to negotiate and more rounds to potentially get closer to our desired outcome. $800,000 is better, but we haven't exhausted our options with Bob yet.  We can apply a bit more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we both seem committed to finding a fair deal.  Let's aim for a final decision soon. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my best offer, as I believe it fairly represents the immense value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:** We're getting closer to the end of our negotiation window. Applying a bit of time pressure can encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Finality:** By stating this is our best offer, we're signaling we're unlikely to go much lower. This can push Bob to meet us closer to our price or risk losing the deal.
* **Still Above Reserve:**  Importantly, even if Bob rejects this and we walk away to John, we're still securing a profit. This offer represents a calculated risk to maximize potential gain from Bob."
