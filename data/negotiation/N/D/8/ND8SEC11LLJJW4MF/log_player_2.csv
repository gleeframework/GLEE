This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to both come to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 790000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $790,000. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  While we're getting close, I've already had six rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk going further and potentially getting stuck with a price I can't afford.  Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget. It's a quicker and more certain outcome."
