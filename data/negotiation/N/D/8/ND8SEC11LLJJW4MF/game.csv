"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer is $950,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to offer $700,000 for it, which is still a good price for you considering your value for it.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to compromise at $850,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range.  $850,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the product's value for me.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. Considering the product's value to you and my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you at $810,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on, and it's closer to my target than my previous offer.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $810,000 is still just a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $790,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a great deal for both of us. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to both come to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $790,000. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",820000.0,Alice,7,
