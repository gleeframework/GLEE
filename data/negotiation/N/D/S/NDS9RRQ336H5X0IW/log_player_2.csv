Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $700000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, recognizing the potential it holds for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.
