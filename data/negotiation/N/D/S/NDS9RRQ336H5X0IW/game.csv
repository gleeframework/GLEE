"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I believe you'd be interested in. It's valued at least $800000 to me, and I'm confident it has significant potential for you. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $700000 for it, reflecting its potential value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $700000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, recognizing the potential it holds for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000, recognizing the value you've placed on this product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
