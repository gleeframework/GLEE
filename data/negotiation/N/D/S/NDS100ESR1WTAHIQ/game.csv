"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as you've mentioned the product is worth $10,000 to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. Let's split the difference.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
