Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone in my message to hopefully build rapport with Bob and make him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $1,200,000. This acts as my ""walk away"" point, meaning I won't accept anything less than that if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it's still too low.  
* **Negotiation Space:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price.  I want to see if I can push him further.
* **Avoiding John:**  While John is a guaranteed $1,200,000, I'm hesitant to sell to him immediately. There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the product's value and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Instead of going back and forth with a large gap, I'm proposing a middle ground. $950,000 is a reasonable compromise between our initial positions. 
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm emphasizing that this offer is fair and reflects the product's value. This is a more logical appeal than simply trying to get a higher price. 
* **""Walk Away Satisfied"":** I'm subtly highlighting the fact that this is a good deal for both of us, implying that rejecting this offer might lead to a less favorable outcome for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is quite close to my initial counteroffer of $950,000. 
* **Potential for Loss:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. There's a chance that Bob will walk away or I might have to lower my price further. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  $920,000 is a significant profit for me, and it's much closer to my goal than selling to John. This is a good outcome, considering Bob's initial valuation of $800,000.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a profitable deal and avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely."
