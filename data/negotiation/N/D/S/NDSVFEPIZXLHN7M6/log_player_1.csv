Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I think $100 would be a fair price for me considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose $110 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Explanation: While we could try to push for a bit more, accepting $110 is a solid deal. It's significantly more than our minimum ($80) and a good portion of Bob's perceived value ($150).  There's always a risk Bob could walk away in further rounds, so taking this offer guarantees a good profit."
