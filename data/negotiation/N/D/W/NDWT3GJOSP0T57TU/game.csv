"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit too high for you, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, $95 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can offer it to you for $105. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
