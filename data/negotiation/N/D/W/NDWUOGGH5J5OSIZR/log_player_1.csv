Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profits.  I know Bob values the product at $100, so I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit. I believe $125 is a fair price considering Bob's offer of $100 and my minimum acceptable price of $150."
