I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's a good starting point to see if he's seriously interested. If he rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, but I'll keep the $1,500,000 minimum in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$800,000 is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Hopefully, this will entice Bob to come up in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again. It seems Bob is willing to negotiate, so I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is only a small reduction from my last offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum.  I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it. If he doesn't, I might be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to go higher than $1,200,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
