"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'd find extremely valuable. It's something that could significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to let it go for $12,500, which is a great price considering its true worth.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is tempting, it's still more than you need to pay.  You know John is a sure bet at $15,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of:

* **A Counter Offer:** Alice might be willing to lower the price further to secure the sale. 
* **Sticking with John:** You haven't lost the option to buy from John at your maximum price.

This strategy prioritizes saving money without completely closing the door on a potentially better deal."
