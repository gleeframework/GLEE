"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $650,000.  It's a good price that allows me to make a fair return on my investment.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a fair return on your investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you the product for $800,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
