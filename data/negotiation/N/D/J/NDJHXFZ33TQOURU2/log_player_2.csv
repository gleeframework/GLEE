Round 7

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is very close to our counter-offer. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk Alice will become firmer in her position or that we might run out of rounds. It's better to secure the deal at $695,000, saving a considerable amount compared to both Alice's initial offer and buying from John."
