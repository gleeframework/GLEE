"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $15,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value can make Bob more inclined to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiating further. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will pay $10,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I believe we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. I am willing to pay $14000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $14,000 is still a significant gain. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  With 9 rounds left, there's ample time to continue the negotiation. 

I will counter Bob's offer, trying to bridge the gap while still maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $14,500? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""Let's close this deal!"") could encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting closer to Bob's price while still ensuring a profitable deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $14000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick with that amount if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain:** Bob has stuck to his $14,000 offer, and while it's not my ideal price, it's still a gain of $4,000 over my minimum value and John's offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, there's less time to negotiate a higher price, and the risk of a stalemate increases. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John would be a safe option, but accepting Bob's offer guarantees a higher profit. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potential loss."
