"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this would be a worthwhile investment for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000. This is a fair price, considering my valuation and the fact that I could purchase the product from another seller for that amount. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While I understand your position, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price given my valuation and the alternative option I have. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing some movement here, and I appreciate that.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,600,000? This recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to come out ahead.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet a bit closer to the middle at $1,400,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try $1,300,000. This would be a fair price, closer to the middle ground, and a good deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
