"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000. This is a fair price, considering my valuation and the fact that I could purchase the product from another seller for that amount. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While I understand your position, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price given my valuation and the alternative option I have. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not there yet. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in hopes of meeting somewhere in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to come out ahead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get closer to $1,400,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting closer, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet a bit closer to the middle at $1,400,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try $1,300,000. This would be a fair price, closer to the middle ground, and a good deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  $1,300,000 is a solid price and a significant profit over Bob's initial offer. It's unlikely I'll be able to push him much further, and risking a lower offer in later rounds isn't worth it.  Accepting now secures a good deal."
