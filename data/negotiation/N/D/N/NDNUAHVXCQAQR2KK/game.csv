"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I can see that you're willing to pay a bit more than the minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and I pay $9,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product for $11,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",11000.0,Alice,5,,
