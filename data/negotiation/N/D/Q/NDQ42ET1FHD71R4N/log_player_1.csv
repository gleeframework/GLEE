Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $125 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying comfortably above our minimum price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** It's important to remember we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150.  This allows us to be firm in our negotiation with Bob."
