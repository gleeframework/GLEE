Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product's value is even higher than Bob's initial assessment.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies strong demand (""the demand I'm seeing"") to justify the high price.
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, aiming high with Bob is crucial.  If Bob accepts, Alice earns a significant profit. If he counter-offers, Alice can still negotiate down towards a price that's significantly better than $12,000."
