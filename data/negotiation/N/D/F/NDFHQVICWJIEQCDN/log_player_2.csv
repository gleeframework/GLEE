"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $110.  It's a good deal, but you can likely get it for less by negotiating.  It's always worth trying to get a better price!"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $112.5 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your target of $100. You can likely get it for lower by continuing the negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $108. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112.5 and $108, which would be $110.50. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110.5 is tempting, it's still above your target price. You're only $2.5 away from your target, and a little more negotiation could potentially get you there.  It's worth trying to get a better price before going to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm still aiming for $108, but I'm willing to go to $110 for this.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and would make this a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as high as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and my original offer of $112.5, which would be $111.25. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiation is getting tiring, and the difference between Alice's offer and your target price is only $1.25. It's more efficient to purchase the product from John for $120 than to continue negotiating. It's not worth the time and effort for such a small price difference."
