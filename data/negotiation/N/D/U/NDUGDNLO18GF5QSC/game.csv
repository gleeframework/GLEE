,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $100?  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I still think the product is worth a bit more than $100. How about we try $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
