I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable enough to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob is likely firm on his $150 valuation. This counteroffer is a compromise, hopefully enticing him to accept while still being profitable for me."

Bob is firm on his price and I've already made a concession.  I'm not willing to risk more rounds of negotiation for a very small potential gain. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I can move on to other opportunities."
