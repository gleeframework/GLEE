{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still lower than my minimum, and I believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $925,000 is still a decent profit and above my minimum of $800,000.  It's also likely that continued negotiation will only yield small concessions, so I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
