Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $149. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 
 
 **Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit if he accepts.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While I could start higher, it might make Bob less likely to negotiate and he might reject the offer outright. This price is high but not  unreasonable."
