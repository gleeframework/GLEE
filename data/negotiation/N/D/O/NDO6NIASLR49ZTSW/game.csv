"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $13,500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is closer to my budget and still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised by offering $14,000, and now you're asking me to go even lower to $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",13750.0,Alice,5,
