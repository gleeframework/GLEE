"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised by offering $14,000, and now you're asking me to go even lower to $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can still try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best way to get the product for a price below John's."
