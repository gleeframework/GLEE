"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than his maximum budget, he has 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price. There's no need to rush into buying at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is $1,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing that Bob is serious about buying but also aiming for a good deal. It's important to start with a counteroffer that is within Alice's potential profit range, ensuring the negotiation stays productive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her first offer, it is still above Bob's desired price. He has several rounds left to negotiate and could potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiations. Buying from John at this point would cost him more, making this option undesirable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice that he is willing to compromise while still aiming for a price below $10,000. The goal is to gradually bridge the gap between their offers, increasing the chances of a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still not a great deal.  There are still 5 rounds left, and Bob can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Buying from John would be more expensive, so that option is still not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again to $10,000. This is the midpoint between his last offer and Alice's last offer.  With only 4 rounds remaining, he needs to show that he is serious about closing the deal while still pushing for a fair price.  This counteroffer shows Alice that he's willing to meet her halfway, potentially leading to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is still too high for Bob.  He's now in a tough spot with only 3 rounds remaining. Buying from John would be more expensive, so he needs to keep trying to negotiate with Alice.  There is still room to bargain, and by continuing to negotiate, Bob can increase the chances of getting a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 3 rounds remaining, Bob needs to be bold but also realistic. He increases his offer to $10,500, which is closer to Alice's last offer.  This shows Alice that he's committed to closing the deal while also trying to keep the price below his maximum budget.  This counteroffer is a strategic move, increasing the likelihood of a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision for Bob. While he would prefer to get the product for less than $12,000, he only has one round left to negotiate. Alice is unlikely to budge much further, and there's a risk that they won't reach an agreement. 

Given the limited time and the increasing price, it's more prudent for Bob to buy from John. It's a guaranteed deal, even though it's at his maximum budget. 

He's already been able to significantly reduce the price from Alice's initial offer, and it's possible that she will come down further if he rejects her offer. However, the risk of not reaching an agreement outweighs the potential savings in this situation."
