"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay above $1 million to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500. This represents a significant concession from my initial asking price, and I'm confident it's a fair offer for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
