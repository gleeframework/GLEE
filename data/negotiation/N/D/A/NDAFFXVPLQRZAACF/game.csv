"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this work for me.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'd like to offer $1,250,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make another concession and come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the closest I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,275,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway *one last time* and offer $1,300,000. I'm running out of time here, so this is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
