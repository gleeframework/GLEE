"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still save $100,000 by rejecting and negotiating with John.  You have leverage because you have another option."
