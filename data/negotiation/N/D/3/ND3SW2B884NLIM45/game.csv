"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $105. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it from you.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer you the product for $100.50. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering.",100.5,Alice,5,
