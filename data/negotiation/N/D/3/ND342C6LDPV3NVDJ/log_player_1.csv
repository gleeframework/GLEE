"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value this product holds."", ""product_price"": 2300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always wise to start negotiations with a price significantly higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that you perceive the product's value to be even higher. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,300,000, I'm setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob intends to negotiate down significantly, this initial price influences his perception of a ""fair"" price.
* **Confidence:** A high initial offer also projects confidence in the product's value.

It's unlikely Bob will accept this initial offer, but it sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value of $800,000, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, so I'll reject this offer and provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000."", ""product_price"": 1950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer keeps me well above my $1,500,000 minimum, providing room for further negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:** By mentioning ""true market value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob that the product might be worth more than his initial assessment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet her current offer. I would like to propose an offer of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation wouldn't yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
