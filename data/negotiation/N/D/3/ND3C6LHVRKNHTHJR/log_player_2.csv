"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better deal from Alice.  If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob can always fall back to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He starts with a counteroffer that is $50,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This is a significant discount, but it is still within a reasonable range.  Bob is hoping that Alice will be willing to compromise to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is a good compromise.  It's a lower price than her initial offer and still within a reasonable range for Bob.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible and the price will rise again.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is not a desirable option, so accepting Alice's offer is the most advantageous choice."
