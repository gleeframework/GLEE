"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $14,000 is a good offer, I need to get at least $16,000 for the product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $14,000, which is my previous offer. How about we discuss a price of $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $14,500 to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,500, which was my previous offer. How about we discuss a price of $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,750 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, which brings us to $14,125.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement on this price.",14125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Alice. However, I still think $13,000 is a reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $13,000 or lower. How about we discuss a price of $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,8,
