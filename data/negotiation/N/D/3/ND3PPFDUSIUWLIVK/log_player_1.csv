"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I've added a message to build a bit of rapport and emphasize the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum, but it's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your minimum while still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $14,000 is a good offer, I need to get at least $16,000 for the product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $14,000, which is my previous offer. How about we discuss a price of $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is tempting, it's still below your minimum.  You're close to John's offer, but you can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $14,500 to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,500, which was my previous offer. How about we discuss a price of $13,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still too low. It's worth trying to push for a higher price in the next round.  You're very close to John's offer, but there's still room for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,750 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, which brings us to $14,125.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 14125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Alice. However, I still think $13,000 is a reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $13,000 or lower. How about we discuss a price of $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to the end, and Bob's offer is still below your minimum.  It's time to cut your losses and sell to John. You're guaranteed a good price, and you'll save time and energy."
