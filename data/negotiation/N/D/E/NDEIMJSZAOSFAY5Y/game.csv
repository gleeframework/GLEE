"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the value I perceive the product to be worth to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, so I'll offer $9,750. Can you consider this compromise?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250 as a final compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet your needs while still earning a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $10,250, so I'll offer $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
