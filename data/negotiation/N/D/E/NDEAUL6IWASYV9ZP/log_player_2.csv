# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price, considering it's worth that much to you, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product at the maximum you value it for. There's no room for negotiation to save money. Rejecting her offer might make her propose a lower price, especially since she knows you have an alternative option with John."
