Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your proposal. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $1,050,000 is still a good amount, I can potentially get closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I have a few rounds left, and I'm not willing to sell to John for a lower price yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm firm on $1,100,000.  Let's make a deal, we're both close to agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your persistence, Alice. I understand your position, and I would like to propose a final offer of $1087500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,100,000,  Bob's offer of $1,087,500 is a good compromise and brings us close to a deal.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and selling to John for $1,000,000 is not an ideal outcome.  This offer allows me to maximize my profit given the circumstances."
