Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Dear Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
