"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and your desire to sell. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business while still recognizing its worth in the market.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still outside of my comfortable range. I'm willing to go up to $925,000 for the product. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in this product. I believe a compromise in this range is possible, and I'm confident that this agreement will benefit both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, $1,200,000 is the lowest I can go for this product.  I have another buyer ready at that price, but I believe in giving you the first opportunity. If you're unable to meet that price, I understand, and we can part ways amicably.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
