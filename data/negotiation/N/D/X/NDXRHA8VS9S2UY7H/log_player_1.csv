Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's a little bit higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. 

I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay close to the price I'm asking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than what John is offering, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I'm aiming for, and it's significantly better than selling to John.  I think it's time to close the deal."
