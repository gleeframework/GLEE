"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you at $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than her minimum selling price ($1,000,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better deal.  It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value and leaves room for us both to benefit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident this product will exceed the value you anticipate, however, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,275,000, which is closer to my target price of $1,200,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and me having to buy from John at $1,500,000 is too high. Accepting her offer saves me $225,000 compared to John's price."
