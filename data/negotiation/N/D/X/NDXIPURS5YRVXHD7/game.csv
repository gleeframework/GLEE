"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  How does that sound?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the concession, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. Can you consider that?",87.5,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $89 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",88.0,Bob,6,
