"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering your valuation, I'd like to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
