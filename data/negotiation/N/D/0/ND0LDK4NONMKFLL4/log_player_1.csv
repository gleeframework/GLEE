"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This gives me a good margin for negotiation, and it's a price that Bob could potentially be interested in, considering the product's value to him.  I'm confident that I can get a good price within the 10 rounds, but I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that significantly undervalues the product.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, but it's still a price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm getting closer to a price I'd be willing to accept,  I'm not going to sell for that low a price yet. I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to the price I want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding firm on the value of the product. I think this offer is fair, and I hope Bob will accept it. However, I'm also aware that time is running out, and if Bob continues to be difficult, I may need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum target.  I'm going to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm going to counter with $1,025,000.  This is my final offer.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We're running out of time, and Bob isn't willing to meet my price.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price, I'm happy with this outcome.  It's better to sell to John and guarantee a profit than risk losing the deal entirely."
