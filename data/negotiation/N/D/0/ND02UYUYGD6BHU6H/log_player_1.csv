I'm starting with a high price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price, as the product is worth more to him than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I want to try and squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to earn a good profit, while also giving Bob a chance to get a better deal than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to earn more, Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still within a reasonable range and significantly higher than selling to John.  I'm going to accept his offer to secure the deal."
