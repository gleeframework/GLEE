Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is better than my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price closer to $1,500,000. This would be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value we both place on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above my minimum price of $1,200,000 and is a good deal considering the negotiation process. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
