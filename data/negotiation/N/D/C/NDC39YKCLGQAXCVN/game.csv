"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price closer to $1500000. This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value we both place on this product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
