"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that I believe is fair and competitive. Let's start with $1800000. I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price closer to $1500000. This would be a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value we both place on this product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
