Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher offer of $15,000 allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin for Alice.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer isn't outrageously high, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds it too steep. This opens the door for a back-and-forth that could land closer to Alice's desired outcome.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at $10,000, ensuring she doesn't lose out."
