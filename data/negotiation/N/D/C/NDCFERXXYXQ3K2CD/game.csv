"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My initial offer is $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product to me, but $1500000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to consider buying it for $800000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800000 is simply too low for this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to reach a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900000.  It's closer to where I need to be, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm willing to go down to $1050000.  This is a significant offer considering my initial price, and it's really the last price I can offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping for a little more flexibility. I'm happy to meet you at $950000, which is a fair compromise, given our previous discussions. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $950000 is still a bit below what I can accept. To make a final compromise, I'm willing to drop to $1000000.  This is my absolute bottom line.  I hope you'll consider it, as it's a fair price for the value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1000000. However, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price to make it work for my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.",975000.0,Bob,8,
