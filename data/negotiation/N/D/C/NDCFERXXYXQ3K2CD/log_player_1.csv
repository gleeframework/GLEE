"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering this product to me, but $1500000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to consider buying it for $800000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$800,000 is far below my minimum, and while it's tempting to accept a deal quickly, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see where we can land."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800,000 is simply too low for this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to reach a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling below my minimum.  I'll counter Bob's offer again and see if we can bridge the gap."

This is a significant offer considering my initial price, and it's really the last price I can offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping for a little more flexibility. I'm happy to meet you at $950000, which is a fair compromise, given our previous discussions. What do you think?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1000000. However, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price to make it work for my budget.

I've reached my limit.  I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000, and Bob is still pushing for a lower price.  I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John to ensure I don't lose out."
