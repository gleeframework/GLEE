"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'd be happy to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This way, I can still make a decent profit, and you'll get a great deal on the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
