Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1300000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it, which is still above your stated value of $1200000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise.

This is a fair price, considering the product's worth $1500000 to you."", ""product_price"": 1275000}"
