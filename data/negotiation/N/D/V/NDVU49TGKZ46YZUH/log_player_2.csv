"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is a good deal, you can potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you coming down to $7,000.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $6,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to make a profit, you know. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $6,800? It's a great compromise, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $7,000 to $6,800, which is getting close to your target price. It's likely she won't go any lower, and buying from John will cost you $8,000.  Accepting the offer saves you $1,200 compared to buying from John."
