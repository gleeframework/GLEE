"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'd rather negotiate and see if I can get a price closer to my budget, or buy it from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially stay within my $8,000 budget.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $6,000, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy the product from John for $8,000 if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my price range, $9,000 is still above my ideal price and what John is offering. I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm ready to walk away and go with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  How about $7,500?  That's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to move, but not so much that I go over my budget.
* **Justification:** By saying $7,500 is a ""fair offer,"" I'm subtly anchoring that price in her mind.
* **Urgency:**  As rounds go by, I need to signal that my time is valuable, and John's offer is looking more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.
* **Price Difference:** While $8,500 is closer to my budget, it's still $500 more than John's offer. 
* **No Guarantee of Further Negotiation:**  Even if I counter, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and I might waste more rounds.

It's time to cut my losses. John's offer is a sure thing at this point."
