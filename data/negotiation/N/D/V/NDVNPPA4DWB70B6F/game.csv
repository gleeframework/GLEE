"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  How about $7,500?  That's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
