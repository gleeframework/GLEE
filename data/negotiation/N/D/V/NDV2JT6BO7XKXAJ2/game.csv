"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you consider $10,200?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",10800.0,Alice,5,
