"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since John is also selling the product for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer means Bob can buy from John and still get the product at the same price. There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer."
