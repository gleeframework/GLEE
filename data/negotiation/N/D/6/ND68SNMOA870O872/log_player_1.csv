"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This is a bold opening move that sets the stage for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum of $10,000, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the following rounds, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $10,000 if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us, but I'm not willing to drop my price too drastically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $10,000 if possible, and I believe I have enough rounds left to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $10,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree. I'm nearing the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, and I need to start closing the deal soon. However, I still want to avoid selling to John for the same price, if possible."
