Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer waiting."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $1,000,000, there's a chance Bob might accept the $800,000 offer. This allows me to potentially make a sale quickly and avoid the risk of John changing his mind. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it at his maximum perceived value makes it highly appealing to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning another buyer, I create a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
