Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is the absolute minimum I'd accept, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $12,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price. Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm willing to continue negotiating.  I believe I can get a price closer to $12,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,250. This offer reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $11,000, which is very close to my previous counteroffer of $11,250.  It's a good deal, and I'm comfortable accepting it rather than risking another round of negotiation where he might lower his offer again.  Furthermore, if I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk running out of rounds and having to sell to John for $10,000."
