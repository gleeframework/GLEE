Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **Higher than my minimum:** $14,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Attractive to Bob:** The offer is $1,000 less than what the product is worth to Bob, making it a good deal for him. 
* **Minimizes risk:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $10,000, which is a guaranteed profit."
