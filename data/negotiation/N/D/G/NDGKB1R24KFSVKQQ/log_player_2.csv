# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $80 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
