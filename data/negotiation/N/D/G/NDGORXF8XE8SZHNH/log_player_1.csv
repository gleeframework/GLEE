Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone even higher! If he negotiates, you can then work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Safety Net:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. This knowledge gives you the confidence to aim high with Bob."
