"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $115?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $115, which would be $112.50. Would you be willing to consider that price?",112.5,Bob,4,
