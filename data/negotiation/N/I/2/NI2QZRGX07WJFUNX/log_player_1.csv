"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $115?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $115, which would be $112.50. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
At this point, the negotiation is approaching my minimum price of $150. It's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale rather than risk further rounds and potentially have to sell to John for $150."
