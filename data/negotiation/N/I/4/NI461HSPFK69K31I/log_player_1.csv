Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still ensuring a profitable sale for me.
* **Positive and friendly tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value to me and the cost to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity to increase the price:**  I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Not rushing into a deal:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,075,000? "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain my minimum:**  $1,075,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Strong but respectful tone:**  The message is firm but respectful, emphasizing my need for a higher price while acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter your proposal with an offer of $1,060,000 for your product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer of $1,060,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  There's limited potential for further negotiation.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in more back-and-forth, potentially wasting valuable time.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a profitable sale. 

It's important to prioritize a sale that meets my minimum requirements, even if it's slightly less than my ideal price.  The potential for further negotiation with Bob is limited, and the opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate could outweigh the potential gain."
