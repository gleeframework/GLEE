Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This offer reflects the value this product brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  While I agree it's a quality item, $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle at $800,000? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is Bob's maximum, it's still considerably less than my minimum and John's standing offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to signal I'm firm on a price closer to my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your persistence in this negotiation.  I value your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  I can't go lower than $900,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
