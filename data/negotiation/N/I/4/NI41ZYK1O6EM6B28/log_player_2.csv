Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This offer reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  While I agree it's a quality item, $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle at $800,000? That's the absolute highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence in this negotiation.  I value your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  I can't go lower than $900,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has drawn a line in the sand at $900,000 and is unlikely to budge further.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a real chance she'll hold firm or you'll waste valuable time trying to get her down those last few increments. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your target price of $800,000. It's time to cut your losses with Alice and secure the product at your desired price."
