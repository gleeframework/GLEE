Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While knowing Bob's valuation is helpful, aiming high initially allows for maximizing potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $15,000 offer provides a cushion for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still decrease the price while staying above her minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's no risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob. 

This approach balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
