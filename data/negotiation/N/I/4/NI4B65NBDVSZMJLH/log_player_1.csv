"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,500 is too low for me, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. How about $8,900? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750 again, but I think that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's getting late in the negotiation and I'm not convinced Bob will budge much more.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a good deal, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
