Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and focuses on the potential benefit to Bob, hoping to create a positive negotiating atmosphere.
* **Open Ended:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially propose a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Maximization:**  Bob's offer of $90 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and is closer to my initial ask of $100. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will walk away entirely or that I'll need to accept an even lower price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
