"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and say $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your creative suggestion, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable with the split. I can do $130, but that's as high as I can go.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying my best to be reasonable here, but $130 is still a bit more than I hoped to spend. If you're really unable to do the split, could you meet me halfway at $118?",118.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you halfway. I can do $127, but that's as close as I can get.",127.0,Alice,7,
