"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $12500 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you be willing to go down to $10000?  I'm really hoping to close this deal today.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford right now. How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $11250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
