Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me leverage. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's enough space between my offer and Bob's perceived value for both of us to potentially find a happy middle ground. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John's offer provides a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for a price lower than $15,000.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's potential for him to increase his offer further.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I'm confident that I can secure a better price with Bob, but knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the power to walk away if necessary.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and signals my seriousness about making a deal.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $11,000 is still above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, which ensures I'm getting a reasonable price for the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to see the value in my counteroffer. 

Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer. If not, I'm prepared to negotiate further or sell to John as a last resort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I can't go above $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me. I hope you can agree with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **No Significant Progress:**  There's a clear gap between our desired prices.  Further negotiations might result in a slight increase, but I don't see Bob going much higher.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price. 

It's time to secure the best possible outcome and sell the product to John for $15,000."
