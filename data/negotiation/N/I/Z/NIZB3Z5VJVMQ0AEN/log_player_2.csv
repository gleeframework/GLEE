Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $500,000?"", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $700,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $700,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $650,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  While I could try to negotiate further, $650,000 is a reasonable price and a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and I risk pushing her away completely by continuing to negotiate."
