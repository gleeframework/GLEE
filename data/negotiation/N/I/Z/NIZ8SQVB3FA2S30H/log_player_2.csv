"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a great opportunity to secure an exceptional value for yourself while enjoying all the benefits this product has to offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can do better than $12,000.  There's room to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to engage in this negotiation. After considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. This is a price that reflects its value while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for me. I hope this proposal works for you, and I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob. He values the product at $15,000 and can get it for $10,500, saving a significant amount of money.  While he could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and him having to buy from John for $15,000 is too high.  Accepting the offer is the best choice."
