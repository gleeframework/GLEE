"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you.  My initial price is $1500000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's unique capabilities.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in your product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is still a fair price considering my valuation and the value I believe I can bring to the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $800000 is too low for me to consider. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential value while accommodating your budget. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1150000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1025000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $950000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is the highest I'm willing to go.  I believe this price is fair, and I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
