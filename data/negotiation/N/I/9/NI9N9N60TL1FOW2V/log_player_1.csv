"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe will be of great value to you. My starting price is $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am very interested, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations.  However, $8,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could we aim for $10000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, $10,000 is still below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a price closer to my target. I still have a few rounds left, and selling to John for $12,000 remains a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose $10500 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I'm not desperate to close the deal and am willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a higher price.  Selling to John for $12,000 is still a better option than accepting Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest.  $10,500 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking for something closer to $11,000. Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose $10500 as the final price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a better deal with Bob is too high.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids any further negotiation."
