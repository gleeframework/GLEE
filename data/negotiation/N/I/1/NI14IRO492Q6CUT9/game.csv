,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1200000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000. Let me know if that's a starting point for us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can do $1050000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Is this a more comfortable number for you?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to pull the trigger at $1000000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1050000, but I need you to meet me at $1025000. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I'm eager to finalize this deal, $1025000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1010000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1025000, but I need you to meet me at $1015000. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
