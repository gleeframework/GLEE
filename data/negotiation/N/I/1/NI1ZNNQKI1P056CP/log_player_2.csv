"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by making a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows his determination to get the best price. However, it's not an unreasonable offer considering Alice's willingness to sell for $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and it's likely Alice is willing to come down a bit more. It's best to reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but he's also showing flexibility.  He's raising his offer, demonstrating his seriousness about buying the product. However, he's still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's current offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Savings:** Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, saving Bob $425,000.
* **Negotiation progress:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in smaller price drops. 
* **Time constraint:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming more risky to continue negotiations.  There's a chance that the deal could fall through, and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.

While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to pay more to John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids potential complications."
