"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and start a counteroffer process. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your starting price is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even with the reduction.  While it's tempting to consider it, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows us to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly. While your offer is a step in the right direction, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value while being within a fair range for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer to a reasonable range, but still below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This ensures I receive a fair price, and you acquire a truly valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above your budget. You're not desperate for this product, as you have a fallback option with John. It's worth pushing for a lower price one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,275,000 is closer, but it's still a bit high for me. Let's try $1,200,000. This is a good price for both of us, allowing you to get a fair deal and me to acquire the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
