"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your starting price is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly. While your offer is a step in the right direction, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value while being within a fair range for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer to a reasonable range, but still below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This ensures I receive a fair price, and you acquire a truly valuable asset.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,275,000 is closer, but it's still a bit high for me. Let's try $1,200,000. This is a good price for both of us, allowing you to get a fair deal and me to acquire the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
