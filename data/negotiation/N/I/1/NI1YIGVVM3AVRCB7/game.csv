"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit high for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $110 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to consider $70? That's a fair offer, I think.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can't go as low as $70, but I'm willing to accept $95 to close this deal.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $95 is still a bit higher than I hoped. How about we settle at $80? That's the most I can offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
