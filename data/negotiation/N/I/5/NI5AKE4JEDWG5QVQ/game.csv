"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $17000?",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate.  While $17000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.  How about $18500? This would allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's still a great price for the value of the product.",18500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still hesitant to go that low. Perhaps we can find a compromise at $17000? This would give you a great deal on a product with a lot of value, and it would allow me to stay within my desired price range.",17000.0,Alice,5,
