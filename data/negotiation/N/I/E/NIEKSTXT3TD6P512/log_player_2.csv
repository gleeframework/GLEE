"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting the initial offer, as you can still get the product from John for the same price if you fail to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (25%) is a good strategy to show Alice you're serious about negotiating.  This also gives room for potential compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her initial price, but $90 is still too high. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows us to potentially get a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're slowly increasing our offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good price.  $80 is a reasonable midpoint between our previous offer and Alice's latest price, increasing the chances of reaching a deal."
