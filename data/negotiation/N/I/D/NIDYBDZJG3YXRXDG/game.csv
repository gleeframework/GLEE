"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to your company. It has the potential to generate a substantial return on investment.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000, which I believe is fair considering its potential.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it at a lower price. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
