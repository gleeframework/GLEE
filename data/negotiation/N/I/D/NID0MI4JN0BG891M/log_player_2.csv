"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $1,100,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, you're starting with a counteroffer that's $50,000 less than that. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still leaving you with a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your maximum price from John ($1,000,000). It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, this counteroffer offers Alice a price that is still above your maximum price but gives her a bit more to work with. This gives Alice a chance to accept and close the deal while ensuring you don't spend more than you're willing to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still higher than the price you can get from John.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice might drag the process out and there's no guarantee she'll come down further. You're better off buying from John and saving yourself the potential for further back-and-forth."
