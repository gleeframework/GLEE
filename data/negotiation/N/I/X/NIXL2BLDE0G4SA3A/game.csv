"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and the market conditions. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value and my initial research, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1100000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1100000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a more significant reduction in price. I'm thinking of $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
