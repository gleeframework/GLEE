Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high but reasonable price:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 aims to maximize profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. 
* **Highlighting value over price:** The message focuses on the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high price.  
* **Creating a sense of urgency (implied):** While not explicitly stated, the message implies that this is a limited-time offer before moving on to another buyer (John).

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing the highest possible price from Bob and mitigating the risk of him rejecting the offer."
