Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I know it's valuable and believe this price reflects that."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A price of $9,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a profit above your minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message aims to convey value and subtly implies there might be other interested parties, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could aim even higher initially, or start closer to $8,000 depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
