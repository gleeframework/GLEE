"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
