Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $76, but I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $79? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $79.  Continuing to negotiate might annoy her and she may be less likely to make a deal. It's a good price and significantly below John's offer."
