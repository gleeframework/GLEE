Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200.  This gives me a good margin, but is still potentially attractive to Bob. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to make a sale, $120 is well below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price. Hopefully, this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached a stalemate.  There's no guarantee he'll accept my counteroffer, and I risk losing time and potentially getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
