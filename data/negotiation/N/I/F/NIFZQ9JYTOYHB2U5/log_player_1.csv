"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's closer to the middle ground between my minimum price and what I know the product is worth to Bob. This way, I can hopefully get a good deal without alienating him right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get more. I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering $95, which is still a good deal for Bob since it's below his value of $120. I'm trying to find a middle ground while still pushing for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering your latest offer, I would like to propose $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $92 is still a good deal for me and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing too hard."
