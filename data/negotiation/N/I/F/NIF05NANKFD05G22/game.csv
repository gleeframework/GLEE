"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply not enough. The product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit from my previous offer. How about $850,000?  It's a fair price, and I think it reflects the value you'll get out of the product. Let's make a deal!",850000.0,Alice,3,
