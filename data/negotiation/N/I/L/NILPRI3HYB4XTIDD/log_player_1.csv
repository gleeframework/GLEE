"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,100,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3

{""product_price"": 1050000}

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get more from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer."

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,000,000. This is another compromise, lowering my price slightly from the previous round but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to balance maximizing profit with closing the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $950,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, acknowledging that time is running out and I need to close the deal.  However, it's still higher than what John is offering, and I hope it will be enough to entice Bob to accept."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, but with only two rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal at all is too high.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While it's not the ideal price, it guarantees a sale and avoids any further risk."
