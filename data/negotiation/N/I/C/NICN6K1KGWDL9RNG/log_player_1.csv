I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counter-offer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good deal.  I'll see what Bob's response is and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$1,000,000 is far too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

I'm offering $1,750,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but also a considerable step down from my initial price. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,550,000.  This is only $50,000 more than what John is offering, so I'm hoping this is enough of a compromise for Bob to agree. If not, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

```

Bob has finally reached my minimum price, but I'm not sure if I want to risk further negotiation and risk getting a lower offer. I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and avoid any further risk."
