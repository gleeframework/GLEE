"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $82? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $82 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $78? It's a fair price for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go quite that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $81? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",81.0,Alice,5,
