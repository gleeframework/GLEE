"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $140. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's room for a counteroffer that benefits both of you.  You can aim to get the price closer to your $150 limit.
* **John is a backup:** Having John as an option provides you with leverage to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** The counteroffer is lower than Alice's initial price, reflecting your desire to save money.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $130 is still above Alice's value of $120, making it a potentially acceptable compromise. 
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly and open tone, aiming to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between her previous offer ($140) and your counteroffer ($130).
* **Profit for both:**  This price allows Alice to make a profit while staying within your budget.
* **No further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice rejecting your counteroffer again, potentially leading to a situation where you're forced to buy from John at a higher price.

By accepting the offer, you get the product at a good price, and the negotiation ends successfully."
