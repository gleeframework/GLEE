Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position, as it allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer down, but starting high gives me more leverage in the negotiation.  I'll be ready to accept counteroffers, but I'll always keep John's offer of $800,000 in mind as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and is well below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but be willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get closer to my desired price.  I believe this offer is reasonable and will hopefully encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $600,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer. I'm starting to feel like this negotiation might take some time, so I'll try to find a middle ground that might get us closer to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $750,000. This offer is a compromise - it's significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but it's also lower than my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, and it hopefully encourages Bob to meet me halfway. I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make one final counteroffer.  I'm feeling a bit frustrated with this negotiation, so I'll aim for a price just a little higher than his offer, hoping to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $700,000. This is a compromise, but it's my final offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's not much higher than his previous offer.  I'm starting to feel like it might be time to cut my losses and sell to John if Bob rejects this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. The negotiation has been lengthy, and I'm feeling like it's time to move on. I'm going to accept John's offer of $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal, and it ensures that I don't end up selling the product for less than what I believe it's worth.  I'll need to be more strategic with my offers in future negotiations."
