Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value of $80, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I want to give Bob some wiggle room to feel like he's getting a good deal, but I'm also not starting too low. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and positive to encourage a good relationship and increase the likelihood of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and Profit:** Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum value of $80, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Engaging in further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a longer process. 
* **Time is money:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
