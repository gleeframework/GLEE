"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You have the option to negotiate further with Alice or buy from John for a guaranteed price within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my absolute maximum price. This gives me the best chance of getting the product within my budget. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll immediately go to John and buy from him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still outside my budget of $8,000.  I'm confident that John will sell me the product for that price, which is the best I can do without going over my limit."
