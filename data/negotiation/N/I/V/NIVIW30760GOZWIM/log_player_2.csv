"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. You have a better option available with John, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer to Alice makes sense. You have room to negotiate and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $11,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $11,000, which is still above your budget. While it is closer to your initial goal, you have a guaranteed deal with John for $10,000. It's a better deal than what Alice is currently offering, so buying from John is the best choice to save money."
