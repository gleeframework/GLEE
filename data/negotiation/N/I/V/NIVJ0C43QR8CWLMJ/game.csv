"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about $14,000? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
