"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm asking for $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** You don't want to pay more than $10,000.
* **There's potential for a better deal.** Since Alice is open to negotiation, there's a chance she'll accept a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is the fallback.** You can always go to John if negotiations fail. 

By rejecting the offer, you start the negotiation process and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
