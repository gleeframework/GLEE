"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept your offer at $10,500. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $11,000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price and still leaves some room for profit for Alice.  It's a good time to close the deal."
