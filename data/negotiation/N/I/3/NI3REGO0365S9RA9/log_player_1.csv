{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It is also attractive to Bob since it's lower than the value he places on the product. This should encourage a counteroffer from Bob, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I am willing to negotiate, I won't accept such a low price.  I will counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $12,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a smooth transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $11,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it is still below my desired value. I will counteroffer again to see if we can find a middle ground. It's risky to accept at this point, as John offers a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
