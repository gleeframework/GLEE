"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value. Can you meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $10000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from your new offer. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. Can you meet me at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still trying to negotiate a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $12500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $11000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me there. Can you seriously consider meeting me at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
