Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

While I could push for more, Bob's offer is getting close enough to my minimum that the risk of him walking away outweighs the potential reward of holding out longer.  This price still represents a significant profit."
