Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but lower than John's offer ($150). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to increase his interest in purchasing.
* **Strategic First Offer:**  Starting high allows me to potentially secure a higher price, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I have John's offer as a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to incentivize him to accept a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  This counteroffer allows room for further negotiation if needed, while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $140 is still beyond my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially with John's offer as a fallback.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:** By rejecting this offer, I can see if Bob is willing to go any higher. If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $135.  This is a final offer, as I have another buyer willing to pay $150.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my last compromise. 
* **Close to Minimum:**  $135 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves a little wiggle room.
* **Highlighting John's Offer:**  Mentioning John's offer adds pressure and urgency to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Clear Decision Point:** This counteroffer forces Bob to make a clear decision: accept or risk losing the deal to John."
