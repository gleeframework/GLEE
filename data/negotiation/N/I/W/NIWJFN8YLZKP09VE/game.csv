"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $70? That's a fair price for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $70. I can do $85, and that's as low as I can go.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $85 is still pushing it for me. I'm willing to pay $75, but that's my absolute limit.",75.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I can meet you at $82.50, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",82.5,Alice,7,
