Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $70. I can do $85, and that's as low as I can go.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I can meet you at $82.50, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down to a price you're willing to accept. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $80, rather than risk Alice not budging further and missing out on a better deal."
