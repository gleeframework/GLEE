"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully extract a better price. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to create a sense of its worth in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to discussion,  encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  While $1,350,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has shown interest.
* **Leveraging Rounds:**  I have 9 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept.  
* **Counter-offer Strategy:** I'll counter-offer to try and close the gap, but I won't settle for anything less than $1,400,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is closer to what I need to get for this product.  It's a fair price considering its unique qualities. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum acceptable offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the unique qualities of the product to justify the price.
* **Call to Action:** I'm calling for a resolution, encouraging Bob to come closer to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1400000, which would be $1300000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more.
* **Rounds Remaining:** I have 6 rounds left, giving me time to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'll counter with a price closer to $1,350,000 to continue negotiating and see if I can reach a deal that benefits me more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the unique value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm again trying to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1250000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe I can get a slightly higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  I only have 4 rounds left, so I need to be careful about not getting too close to my minimum without finding a good deal. 
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to close the gap and secure a deal that's closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,275,000, which is a fair price considering the unique value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm only dropping my price by a small amount to show I'm willing to be flexible but not sacrificing much. 
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal, pushing Bob to make a decision.
* **Fairness:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $1250000, so I'm sticking with my previous offer. Can you meet me at $1250000 or is that the lowest you're willing to go? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  I'm down to my last two rounds, and Bob is sticking to his offer of $1,250,000. 
* **Minimum Price:** While $1,250,000 is only slightly above my minimum, I'm not confident I can push Bob higher in the remaining two rounds.
* **Jhon's Offer:** Selling to Jhon guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, which is a safer option considering the limited time and Bob's unwillingness to budge."
