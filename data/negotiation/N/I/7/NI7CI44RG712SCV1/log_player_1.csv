Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your bottom line, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? I'm really close to walking away, but I still think this product could be a great fit for me.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $9,500.  While I'd prefer $10,000, accepting his offer is still a significant profit above my minimum ($8,000). There's a real risk that if I push further, he'll walk away. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him and settling for John's offer."
