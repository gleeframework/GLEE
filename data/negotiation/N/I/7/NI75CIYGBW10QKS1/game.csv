"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget. However, $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10500? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to where I need to be.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $10500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10000? I'm willing to pay the full amount, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
