Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $875,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Since this is his final offer and I'm running out of rounds, it's in my best interest to accept and secure the sale.  While I could try to squeeze out another few thousand dollars, it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely."
