"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However,  $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $7,000? I'm hoping we can strike a deal that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's try $7,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer. I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're definitely getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit and offer $7,200. That's a fair compromise, don't you think? ",7200.0,Bob,6,
