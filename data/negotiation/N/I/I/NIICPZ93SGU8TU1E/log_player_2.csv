You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to you. Alice's offer of $15,000 is too high. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping she'll be willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm raising my offer to $9,500. This is a compromise, closer to Alice's price but still within my budget. I'm hoping she'll see this as a good deal and accept it."
