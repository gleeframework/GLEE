Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $160 is my ideal price, I could be persuaded to go as low as $140. That's already quite a reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I really think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. However, $90 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet your minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed $120 from John."
