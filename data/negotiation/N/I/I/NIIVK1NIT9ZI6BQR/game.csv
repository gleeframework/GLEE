"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $160 is my ideal price, I could be persuaded to go as low as $140. That's already quite a reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I really think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. However, $90 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? This is my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,6,
