"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. There's no point in accepting it now. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive and polite tone while expressing interest in the product. This helps foster a good negotiating environment. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) sets a negotiation anchor.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, it gives us room to negotiate upwards towards a more agreeable price. 
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message avoids giving a specific reason for the lower offer.  This allows Alice to potentially justify a counteroffer without feeling like she's giving up too much ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we try $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above her value for the product. There's room for further negotiation. We can try to push a bit lower before considering accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can do. Would you consider $9,500?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** Recognizing that Alice lowered her price helps maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere and shows we're willing to work towards a deal.
* **Gradual Increase:**  We're moving up in smaller increments now, signaling that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** This counteroffer aims to land slightly above Alice's value for the product ($10,000) while staying well below our maximum.  There's a decent chance she might accept this to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can do $10,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has now met her own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and continuing to negotiate might make her less willing to sell. This offer saves you $2,000 compared to John's price, which is a great deal!"
