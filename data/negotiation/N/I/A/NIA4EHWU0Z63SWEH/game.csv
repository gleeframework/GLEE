"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $9,000 is getting close to the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go a bit lower. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
