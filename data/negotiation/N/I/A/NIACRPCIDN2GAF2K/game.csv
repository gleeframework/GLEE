"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $10,500.  This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
