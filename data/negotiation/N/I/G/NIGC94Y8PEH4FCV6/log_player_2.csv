"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer, considering our mutual understanding of its value. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I still believe the product's value is significant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At $1,050,000, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price represents a significant savings compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
