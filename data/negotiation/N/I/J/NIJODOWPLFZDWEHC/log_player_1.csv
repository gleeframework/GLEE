Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price of $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""interest"" and listing it ""publicly"" adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
