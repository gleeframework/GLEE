"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your target price. You can potentially save money by counter-offering. There's a chance Alice might accept a lower price, especially since she's already willing to sell for less than her own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm aiming to stay closer to my budget. I'd be happy to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. How about $980,000? It's still a great deal for you and allows me to get a little closer to my target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $980,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and just slightly higher than Bob's counter-offer.  It's also a much better price than buying from John for $1,000,000."
