"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. It's a game-changer in its industry and I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that 12000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do 11000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate further before considering John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. If we can agree on that price, I'm ready to purchase the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do 10800 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is still slightly above my maximum budget of $10,000. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of continuing to reject offers increases the likelihood of Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal altogether.  At this point, it's more efficient and less risky to buy the product from John for $10,000 and ensure a successful transaction."
