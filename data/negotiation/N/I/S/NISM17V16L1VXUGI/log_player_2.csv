# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?
