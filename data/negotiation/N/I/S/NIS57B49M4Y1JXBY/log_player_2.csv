"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above your maximum price point of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,350,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we settle on $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still within your budget of $1,500,000 and is a significant improvement from her previous offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, potentially leading you to either pay John's higher price or miss out on the product altogether. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product within your budget."
