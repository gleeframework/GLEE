"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to Bob. Alice's offer of $140 is too high. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in buying, but I'd like to offer $125. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $135?  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has come down to $135, which is still more than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's close enough to Bob's maximum budget that it's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal."
