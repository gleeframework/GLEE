Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point that is higher than my minimum value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, he has room to negotiate up to my price without losing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
