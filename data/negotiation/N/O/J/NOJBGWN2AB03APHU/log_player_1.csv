"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a significantly high offer ($2,300,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.  
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""substantial benefits"" to justify the high initial price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** While John offers my minimum acceptable price, securing a deal with Bob above that ensures I maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $2,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,150,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to secure the best deal possible, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob over the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product and the return on investment it offers.  I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I propose a price of $1,950,000.  This reflects a more realistic valuation."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Still Above Minimum:** I've reduced my price by $350,000, demonstrating flexibility but remaining well above my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message continues to highlight the product's value and potential return on investment to justify the high price.
* **Testing Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer aims to gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product.  If he's unwilling to move closer to a reasonable price, I may consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to move from your initial price, but I still think $1,950,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,950,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,550,000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away from the deal. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
