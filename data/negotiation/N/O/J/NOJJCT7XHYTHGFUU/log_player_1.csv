"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $130 is above $80, giving him a potential benefit from the purchase.
* **Is below your minimum:**  $130 is still above your $150 minimum, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth process to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since I have other options (John is willing to pay $150), rejecting Bob's offer is the best course of action. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $120? This would still be a good value for you, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm  not willing to settle for a price that's so low, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay $150. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a mutually agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $115?  That's closer to your offer and would still leave us both satisfied."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $107.50 is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm  not willing to settle for a price that's so low, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay $150. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a mutually agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get a good price, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $112.50.  This meets you halfway and leaves us both with a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $105. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, he is still significantly below it. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay $150, which is far more advantageous than settling for $105.  

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a profitable outcome and avoid further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
