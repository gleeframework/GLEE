"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it could bring to me. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you think it could bring value to you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $950000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $975000. I think this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
