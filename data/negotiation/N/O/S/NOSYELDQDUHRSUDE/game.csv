"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to your portfolio. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a good value for you given your own valuation.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I understand your perspective on the value, but to be honest, $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's close this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1 million.  Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference and agree on $987,500.  This is a fair compromise that leaves us both with a good deal. ",987500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right that we're both aiming for a fair deal. Let's be real - splitting the difference based on where we started doesn't reflect the progress we've made.  I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000, but that's my final offer. It's a very competitive price for a product of this value.",1010000.0,Alice,7,
