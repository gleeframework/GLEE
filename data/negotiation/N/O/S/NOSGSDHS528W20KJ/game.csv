"I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that. I'd be willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  While $13,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250, meeting you halfway.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know what you think.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,250, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $13,750 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your offer of $13,750, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. To be fair, I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
