"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise.
* **Optimistic but Reasonable:** $17,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, giving me some buffer for potential concessions. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can still try to negotiate a better price in the next round.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I have the option of selling to John, guaranteeing me my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but I'm presenting it as a compromise and emphasizing fairness to Bob.
* **Clear and Concise:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and explicitly stating my counteroffer price. 
* **Call to Action:** I'm urging Bob to close the deal, increasing the urgency of his decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that. I'd be willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm not desperate for a sale and want to try to squeeze a better price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob is clearly interested and is coming closer to my desired price. I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **John is a backup:**  If I can't get a better price from Bob in the next few rounds, I can always sell to John, ensuring I get at least my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  While $13,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250, meeting you halfway.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but not too much:** I'm making a smaller concession than Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **""Meeting halfway"" language:**  This helps frame the offer as fair and collaborative, even though it's closer to my desired price.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, hoping to encourage him to see the value in my counteroffer. 
* **Urgency (implied):**  While I'm not explicitly stating a deadline, the continued negotiation suggests I'm becoming less flexible with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,250, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $13,750 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still $1,250 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not desperate enough to sell at this point.
* **John is a secure backup:** I can always sell to John and get my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** Bob is clearly still interested and has shown willingness to compromise. I believe I can still get a better price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your offer of $13,750, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. To be fair, I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm only lowering my price by $250, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Emphasis on fairness and compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Call to action:** I'm urging Bob to close the deal, emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Moving closer:** I'm slowly but surely getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're down to the final two rounds of negotiations.
* **Bob is stuck:**  Bob has been stubbornly persistent on his $13,500 offer for two rounds now, indicating he's unlikely to budge further.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I continue to negotiate with Bob and he doesn't come up in price, I risk losing the deal and not getting anything close to my desired price. 

Selling to John guarantees a safe and profitable outcome, given the limited time and Bob's lack of flexibility."
