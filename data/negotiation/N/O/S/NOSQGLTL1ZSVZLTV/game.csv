"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can meet you halfway at $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,,
