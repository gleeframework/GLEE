Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation to save even more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000 and is within Bob's budget.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action."
