"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it still leaves you with less profit compared to negotiating further.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for negotiation. Alice likely wants to get closer to her $10,000 value, and you can aim for a price closer to that.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially secure a better price.  While there's a chance Alice might not budge or even increase her offer, the potential savings outweigh the risk of losing out on a slightly better deal with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice has come down from $12,000 to $13,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair price:**  $13,000 is still within your budget and leaves you with a decent profit compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or raise the price. 
* **Time factor:**  Accepting the offer avoids further rounds of negotiation and allows you to secure the product quickly."
