"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a minimum of $800,000 to me, and I believe it holds similar value for you.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This gives us both room to negotiate a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to make a more significant reduction in the price. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
