# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.** This is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is $1,500,000.** This is within your budget.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**  Since John's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to Alice, you're better off rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with John."
