,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, which is still a good value for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
