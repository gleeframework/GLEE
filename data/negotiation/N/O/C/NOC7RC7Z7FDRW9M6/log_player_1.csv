Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than $80, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:** $100 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.

By offering a slightly higher price, you might trigger a counteroffer from Bob, giving you an opportunity to negotiate further. If Bob rejects, you can always fall back on selling to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $80. How about we meet at $90? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still below my desired price, it's close enough to my minimum and worth accepting to avoid further negotiation. It's better to secure a sale at a decent price than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for my minimum."
