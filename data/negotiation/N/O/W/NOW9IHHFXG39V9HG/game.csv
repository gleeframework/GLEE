,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1150000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $1150000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1120000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1120000 is still a bit high.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1100000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your previous offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1080000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,7,
