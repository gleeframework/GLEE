"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high. Could we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within Bob's budget ($15,000) and closer to his ideal price than John's offer.
*  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without risking further negotiation or potentially losing the product to another buyer."
