"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. However, $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",11500.0,Alice,3,
