"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

You can do better than $12,000!  It's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. However, $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you can potentially negotiate a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or pushing the price even higher is too high.  $11,500 is a fair compromise and a good deal compared to buying from John."
