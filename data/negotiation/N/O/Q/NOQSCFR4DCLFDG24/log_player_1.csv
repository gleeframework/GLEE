Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This price is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value for Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm starting with a higher price to see if I can get a quick deal. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I also have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. However, $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $11,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and reiterate the value proposition of the product, while also expressing my desire to find a compromise. 
* **Strategy:**  I'm trying to gauge Bob's flexibility and see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price. If he rejects this counteroffer, I'm prepared to consider selling to John for my minimum price."
