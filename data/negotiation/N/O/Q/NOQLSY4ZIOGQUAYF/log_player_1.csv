"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  There are still 6 rounds left, so there's time to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,600,000. This is a smaller decrease from my previous offer, signaling that I'm becoming more firm in my price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I still think I can get more. It's only $100,000 below what I can sell it to John for, and I'm not willing to accept a loss just yet. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $1,450,000. This is a small concession, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hopeful that he'll see this as a fair price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what John is offering. With only two rounds left, it's unlikely I can secure a better price from Bob. It's time to move on and sell to John for $1,500,000."
