Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $90 for it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. I'll be prepared to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only pay up to $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to secure the sale now than risk a prolonged negotiation that could lead to no deal."
