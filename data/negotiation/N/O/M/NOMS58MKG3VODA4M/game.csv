,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $1,550,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at this price.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made a number of concessions to try to reach an agreement.  $1,350,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000 as a final offer.  This is a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you've made some significant concessions, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1375000.0,Bob,8,
