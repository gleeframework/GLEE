"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This creates some room for negotiation while still demonstrating my value proposition. I'm also keeping the door open for potential deal breakers by highlighting the opportunity and value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept an offer that undervalues my product. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, keeping in mind Bob's counteroffer and the potential of selling to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $1,550,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if we can bridge the gap further before resorting to selling to John.  I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  However, we're getting close to the end of our negotiations. I need to weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob against the potential of selling to John. While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I'm also aware that if I reject this offer, I may not get another chance from him. 

I'll make a final counteroffer, but if he rejects it, I'll likely sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I've made a number of concessions to try to reach an agreement.  $1,350,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000 as a final offer.  This is a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you've made some significant concessions, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're in the 8th round, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I've made significant concessions, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown. 

Given the time constraint and the potential of a deal with John for my desired price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  While I would have preferred to close with Bob, the certainty of John's offer and the limited negotiation rounds outweigh the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
