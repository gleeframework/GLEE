# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is still too high.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings, and I'm confident you'll see it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal.  There's still room for negotiation and Bob should continue to try to drive the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing flexibility, $1,250,000 is still too high for Bob. He's willing to walk away and buy from John if he has to, so he should keep pushing for a lower price. There's still room for negotiation, and with a few more rounds, Bob might be able to get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
