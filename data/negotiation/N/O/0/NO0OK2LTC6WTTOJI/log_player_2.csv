"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $13,500. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $13500 to you. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14,500? This would give us a good middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price for the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go below $16000. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach a deal. I'm offering the product to you for $15800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. At this point, it's likely that further negotiations will be difficult. Buying from John guarantees the desired product at the maximum acceptable price."
