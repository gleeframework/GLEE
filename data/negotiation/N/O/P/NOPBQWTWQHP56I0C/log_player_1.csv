Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe $11,500 is still too high for me. I would like to stick to my original offer of $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take $10,000, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I have more rounds to go, and I'm not going to give up so easily!"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle again at $10,750?

While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to Bob and see if we can close the deal. If not, I'll sell to John for $15,000."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm willing to accept $10,550 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to me.
