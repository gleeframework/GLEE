"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

This is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly starting high, and we know her walk-away price is much lower. Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. How about $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves a decent margin for her to make a profit. 
* **Establishes a negotiating position:** This lets Alice know we're serious about getting a lower price and sets the stage for further negotiation.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** We have a lot of ground to cover between $10,000 and $14,000. This gives us flexibility to increase our offer in future rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $12,000? That's still a good deal for you, given the product's value.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Excellent deal:** Alice has come down to her own valuation of the product. This is a fantastic price for us and saves us $3,000 compared to John's offer. 
* **Little room for further negotiation:**  While we might be able to squeeze out a few hundred dollars more, it's unlikely to be significant. Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice withdrawing the offer or the negotiations stalling."
