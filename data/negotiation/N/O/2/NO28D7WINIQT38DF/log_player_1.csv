"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer above your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Phrasing like ""I'm open to discussing this further"" encourages Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation process. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump, it's still substantially lower than our target and even our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate.  We'll aim to bring him closer to $2,000,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. This product truly has the potential to be a game-changer, and its value is reflected in my pricing. While I can't go as low as $1,800,000, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, considering the product's exceptional qualities."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging and Appreciating:**  We want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone throughout the negotiation.
* **Firm but Flexible:** We're signaling that we're willing to compromise (coming down $200,000) but also holding strong on the product's value.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's unique benefits helps justify the price in Bob's mind. 
* **Strategic Movement:** The counter-offer encourages Bob to believe a deal is within reach while still leaving us room to move closer to $2,000,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product has great potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,000,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our target price of $2,000,000. While we could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, the difference is unlikely to be significant enough to risk losing the deal. Accepting now secures a strong profit."
