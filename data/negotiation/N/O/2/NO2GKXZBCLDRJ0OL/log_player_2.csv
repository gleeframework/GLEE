"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is way above Bob's budget and even higher than the product's worth to Alice. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is going to try to get the best possible deal. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice and his maximum is $10,000. He's going to start by offering his maximum, hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate down from her initial high price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than Bob's maximum. While $14,000 is closer to his limit, Bob is still better off trying to negotiate a lower price. He can still get a better deal from John if he fails to reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from $10,000 to $11,000, showing he's willing to compromise but still trying to get a good deal.  This is a reasonable counteroffer considering he knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than Bob's maximum, but it's getting closer. Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price, but he needs to be careful as he is running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he's still trying to negotiate a lower price. He's raised his offer slightly to $11,500, showing he's willing to compromise but still trying to get a good deal. He needs to be careful as he is running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, but it's getting closer.  Bob has two rounds left and needs to get the best possible deal.  He can potentially get a better price if he continues to negotiate, but if it doesn't work out, he can always buy from John for $10,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer seems like the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting very close to his limit, but he has only two rounds left. He needs to get the best possible deal, and he knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice.  So, he's offering $12,000, hoping Alice will accept. If she doesn't, he can always buy from John for $10,000.  This is a risky move, but it could be a last-ditch effort to get a better deal."
