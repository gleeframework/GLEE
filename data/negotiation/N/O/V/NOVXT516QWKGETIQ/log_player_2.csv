"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, there's potential to get a lower price. It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $675,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, there's still room for negotiation.  I believe I can get a price closer to $650,000 by continuing to negotiate.  I'm willing to take a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $675,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price point that works for both of us.  How about $660,000?  Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 660000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to $670,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $670,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $670,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $670,000, which is only $10,000 away from my last counteroffer. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will take longer and may not result in a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a good price, saving $130,000 compared to buying from John."
