I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a fair price considering it's worth $15,000 to him and I need to earn at least $12,000.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway.  I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.  Hopefully, he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $13,200 is a good price, especially since he's already rejected my last offer.  While I'd prefer $13,500, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
