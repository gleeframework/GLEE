"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $1050000. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a fair price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 is the right price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll counteroffer with a price of $1050000, which is the same as my previous offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $980000 is the right price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll counteroffer with a price of $1020000. This is a compromise, but I think it's the best we can do at this point.",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $1020000. I'm willing to meet you at $990000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here.",990000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $990000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer with a price of $1015000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
