Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's a good strategy to start with a higher price than your minimum to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** Mentioning the product's potential value to Bob makes the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a potential compromise.

**Note:**  This is just an initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and aim to maximize my profit while keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can we meet in the middle at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $9,000 is only $1,000 below my starting point and well above my minimum of $8,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll raise his offer. He might even lower it, or we might get stuck in a stalemate.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed deal, accepting Bob's offer gives me a slightly higher profit and is still a good outcome. 

**It's better to take the sure thing and secure a profit than to risk a lower offer or a failed negotiation.**"
