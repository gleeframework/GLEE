"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,000 is way over Bob's budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but there's no reason to accept an offer that high right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is going to start by making a strong counteroffer. Since he can get the product from John for $10,000, that's the price he's going to offer Alice. It's a bold move, but Bob has nothing to lose.  Alice will either accept and Bob gets a great deal, or she rejects and they continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation, so Bob should continue trying to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Bob is going to offer Alice $11,000. This is a compromise between his budget and what Alice is willing to sell for. It's a good middle ground that could lead to a successful negotiation."
