"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll make a counteroffer of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $900,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm ready to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to our goals.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'll counter with $887,500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at last.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and get closer to my budget, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $870,000, which is a fair price for both of us and would get us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",870000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $870,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make another small concession, so I'll counter with $882,500. This is my last offer before I need to reconsider other options.",882500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we might be at an impasse. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to explore other options.",875000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $882,500, Bob. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm not willing to make another concession, so this is my final offer.",882500.0,Alice,9,
