Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  This gives him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can still go up a bit, but you won't be risking much. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also be mindful of the risk of losing the deal entirely!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product and would like to propose a price of $100. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting because it guarantees a sale, it's only $100, which is the absolute minimum you're willing to accept.  Since you can still sell to John for the same price, you're better off rejecting and seeing if you can get a higher offer from Bob.  

By rejecting, you signal that you're not desperate to sell at a low price.  This could potentially encourage Bob to raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105, considering your interest in the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate, but not too desperate. 
* **Still profitable for you:**  You're still making a profit, but it's a smaller margin than your initial offer. 
* **Clear message:**  You're stating your reason for rejecting his offer and setting a specific price point for your counteroffer.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still maintaining your position."
