"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth quite a bit to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  I'm asking $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $70 is more than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $85.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, which would be $77.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While $77.50 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to continue the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going below $80.  This product is truly worth more than that to you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about we split the difference again and go with $82.50? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, which would be $79.25. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I will sell the product to John for $80. 

While Bob's offer of $79.25 is close to my minimum acceptable price, the negotiation process is taking longer than expected.  I've already used 6 rounds, and I need to ensure I can secure a sale within the allotted 10 rounds. Selling to John guarantees me $80, which is my minimum desired price, and ensures I don't risk losing out on a deal entirely."
