Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, starting above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) is key.
* **Negotiation Room:** The $1,100,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your bottom line is $1,200,000, so don't go below that."
