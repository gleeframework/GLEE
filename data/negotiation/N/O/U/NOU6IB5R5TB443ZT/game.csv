Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness.,180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for this product, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $80. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $80. If you're not willing to go lower, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $120 and $80. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one last compromise. I'll meet you at $95. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness, and I'm willing to give you a small discount to close the deal.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $90. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'm going to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $92. It's the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me in the middle.",92.0,Alice,9,
