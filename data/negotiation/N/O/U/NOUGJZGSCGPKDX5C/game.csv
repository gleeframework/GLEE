,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last compromise. I can offer it to you for $10200. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",10200.0,Alice,7,
