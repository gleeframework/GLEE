"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's start our negotiations with this offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is far above what I'm willing to pay.  I'm ready to offer you $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds, and selling to John is always an option, so I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. I'm offering you the product for $1,600,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,600,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to offer you $1,400,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,500,000 I could get from John. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway.  I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above what I can afford.  I'm going to offer you $1,350,000.  This represents a significant move on my part.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer. To avoid further risk of getting a lower price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is a guaranteed outcome that meets my minimum target."
