"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is far above what I'm willing to pay.  I'm ready to offer you $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. I'm offering you the product for $1,600,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's reach a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,600,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to offer you $1,400,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you say?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
