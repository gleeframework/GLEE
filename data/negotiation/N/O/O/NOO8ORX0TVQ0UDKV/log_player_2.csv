"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as the product is worth significantly more to you than the price I'm asking.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
