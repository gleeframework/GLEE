Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you, considering your value for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.
