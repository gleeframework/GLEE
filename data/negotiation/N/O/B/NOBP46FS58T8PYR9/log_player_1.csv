Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that would benefit you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting closer to that figure is strategic.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $11,500 offer leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed a profitable sale."
