Round 7
Alice's offer:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While we could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her final offer.  The difference between her offer ($937,500) and John's price ($1,000,000) is significant enough to warrant accepting. It's always possible to get a slightly better deal, but the risk of pushing Alice away and having to go with John is too high at this point."
