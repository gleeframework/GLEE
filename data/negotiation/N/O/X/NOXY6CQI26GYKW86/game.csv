"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $87.50, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's make this deal happen!",87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $89.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you. Let's close this deal.",89.0,Alice,5,
