"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to me. I'm confident you'll find it a profitable investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my own budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects a compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's now within his budget.  Further negotiation might get the price down even lower, but there's a risk Alice might reject the counteroffer and the deal could fall apart.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, avoiding potential delays or losing the deal altogether."
