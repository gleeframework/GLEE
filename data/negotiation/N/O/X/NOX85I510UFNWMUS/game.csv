"Alice, thanks again for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm willing to purchase it from you directly.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
