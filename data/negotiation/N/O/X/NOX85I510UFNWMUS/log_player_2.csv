# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has negotiated the price down to $11,250. This is a significant saving compared to buying from John for $15,000.  While a price of $11,000 would be ideal, it's likely that Alice is firm on her final offer, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or a higher price from John.  Accepting the offer at $11,250 secures a good deal and saves Bob money."
