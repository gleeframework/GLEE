"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not quite on the same page.  $9500 is still significantly below what I need to make this worth my while.  Let's try $10500.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here.  $9200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to start considering other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
