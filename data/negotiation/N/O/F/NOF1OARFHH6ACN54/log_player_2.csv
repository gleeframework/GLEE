"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's a good idea to negotiate and see if you can get it closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than my actual budget. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a better deal. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating relationship. I'm not outright rejecting Alice's price but suggesting an alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for me. Could you do $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Negotiating:** While Alice moved closer to my price range, $100 is still above my target. There's room for further negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the option to buy from John for $80, giving me leverage.  I don't need to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a fair price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $80? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm being direct about my budget constraints and desired price.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious and won't go any higher. This adds a sense of urgency for Alice to make a decision.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still comfortable walking away and buying from John for $80 if Alice rejects this offer."
