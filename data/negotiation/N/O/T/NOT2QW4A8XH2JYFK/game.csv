"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I value finding common ground, the $900,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the product's true worth.  How about we settle at $1,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the value I'm offering.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's land this. To show my good faith, I'm prepared to come down slightly more. How about $985,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",985000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $985,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a compromise. I propose $920,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",920000.0,Bob,6,
