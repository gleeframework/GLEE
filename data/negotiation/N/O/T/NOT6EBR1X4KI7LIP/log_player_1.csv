Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
