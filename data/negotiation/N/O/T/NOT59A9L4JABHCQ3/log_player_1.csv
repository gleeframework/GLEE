Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $110. I believe you'll find it to be of excellent value."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $120. Aiming for a price close to this maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $110 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal while still netting you a significant gain.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 provides a safety net. You don't want to price so high that Bob refuses, leaving you with the lower offer."
