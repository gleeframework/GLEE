"Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $12000, considering the value of this product.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
