"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to kick off negotiations at $1,500,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That number seems quite high to me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you partway at $1,100,000. This offer takes into account the value you'll gain while still reflecting the worth of what I'm bringing to the table. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we try $750,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and I think it represents a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $750,000 is closer to a fair deal, I can't let it go for anything less than $950,000. This is a serious offer reflecting the significant value this product brings.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit rich for me. I'm willing to go to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a fair offer, and it saves us both from potentially lengthy negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,6,
