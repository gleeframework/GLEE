{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than your minimum acceptable price.** This gives Bob a sense that there is room for negotiation and encourages him to make a counteroffer.
* **The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation.** It also subtly highlights the potential value for him.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Start the negotiation in a way that benefits you.**
* **Encourage a counteroffer from Bob, giving you more information about his willingness to pay.**
* **Maintain a balance between earning a good price and keeping Bob engaged.**

I'm ready to process Bob's response and adapt my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the $8000 range. Would you be willing to adjust your offer accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial assessment, it still falls below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It is worth exploring if we can bridge the gap with a counteroffer.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  There is a possibility that a counteroffer can nudge Bob closer to a price that is more favorable to me.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, I might still be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, if I reject his offer and he walks away, I will have to sell to John at a lower price.  

**Next steps:**

I will carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that is closer to my desired range.  I will need to balance the need to get a better price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,000 is a bit lower than what I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $10,000 for the product. This would allow me to recover a portion of my investment and still make the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise & Incentive:** The counteroffer of $10,000 represents a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. This shows flexibility while emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Framing:**  The message highlights the ""recovery of investment"" aspect, suggesting that I am making a significant concession to accommodate Bob's budget. 
* **Openness:** The message ends with a question to invite further dialogue and potentially negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I am not desperate for a quick sale and that I believe the product is worth more.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This counteroffer will reveal whether Bob is willing to meet me halfway. 
* **Maximize potential gain:** $10,000 is still closer to my desired price point than $8,000.

I'm ready to analyze Bob's response and adapt my negotiation strategy based on his next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $9000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is still below my desired price point, it represents a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer and is close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal, I believe it is wise to accept Bob's offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** There is not much room left for further negotiation as Bob is now offering closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation will consume more time and effort without a guarantee of a higher price.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $9,000 provides a good compromise, ensuring a sale while minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potential loss."
