While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirements.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is still a good deal for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance she'll walk away, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product for a good price."
