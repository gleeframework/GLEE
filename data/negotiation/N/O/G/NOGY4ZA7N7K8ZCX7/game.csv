"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm excited about the opportunity to purchase it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find an agreement,  $900,000 undervalues the product's potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects both its value and my willingness to negotiate.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",950000.0,Bob,4,
