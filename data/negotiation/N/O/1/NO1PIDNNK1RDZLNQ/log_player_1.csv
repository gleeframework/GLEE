Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his perceived value of the product might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I am open to negotiation, I cannot accept such a drastic reduction. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise. It's a good midpoint to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if we can find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough.  I'm not confident we'll reach a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation.  John offers a safe and certain deal, and I'm choosing to sell to him."
