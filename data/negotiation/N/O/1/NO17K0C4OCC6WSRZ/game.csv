"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something valuable, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,200,000?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, while giving you a substantial discount from my original offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still a significant profit for you and a fair price for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,075,000.  This would allow me to recover a good portion of the product's value, while still leaving you with a great deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This allows you to recover a significant portion of the product's value, while staying within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to negotiate.  While $975,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need to ensure I get a fair return on this product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000.  This is a substantial reduction from my previous offer and is closer to your budget.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and it allows you to recover a considerable portion of the product's value.  I believe this is a fair compromise that will benefit both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
