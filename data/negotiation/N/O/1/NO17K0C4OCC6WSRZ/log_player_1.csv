"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something valuable, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer because $800,000 is far below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,200,000?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, while giving you a substantial discount from my original offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still a significant profit for you and a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,075,000.  This would allow me to recover a good portion of the product's value, while still leaving you with a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This allows you to recover a significant portion of the product's value, while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I have more rounds to try and reach a better price with Bob, or I can always sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to negotiate.  While $975,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need to ensure I get a fair return on this product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000.  This is a substantial reduction from my previous offer and is closer to your budget."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and it allows you to recover a considerable portion of the product's value.  I believe this is a fair compromise that will benefit both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum threshold, but I only have two rounds left and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher. It's better to be certain of a sale at my minimum price by selling to John."
