Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a good deal! Alice is signaling that this is her lowest price, and it's significantly lower than John's offer.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
