"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's a fair price considering my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm  confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $875,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $887,500. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
