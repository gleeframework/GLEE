Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  While $900,000 is closer to your target, it's still more than you want to pay.  Let's see if you can get her down to $875,000."

{""message"": ""Alice,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm  confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $875,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $887,500. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and has come down quite a bit from her initial offer. While you might be able to get a slightly lower price with more negotiation, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting Alice's offer at $887,500 ensures you get the product at a good price within your budget."
