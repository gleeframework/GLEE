"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. How about $850,000? That's still a significant value for you, and it allows me to reach my minimum target.",850000.0,Alice,3,
