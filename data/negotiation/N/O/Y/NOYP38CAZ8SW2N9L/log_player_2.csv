Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,250 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. You can get the product for $10,000 from John with no further negotiation. It makes the most sense to cut your losses and buy from John to maximize your savings."
