"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer is lower than my initial price, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I believe I can get a better deal with Bob, or at least, I'm willing to try. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $9,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500. That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still determined to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,250 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10250}
