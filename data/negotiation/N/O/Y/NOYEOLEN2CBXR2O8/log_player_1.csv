"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,650,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still believe that $1,500,000 is a fair price considering my financial situation. I would like to stick to that amount if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $1,500,000.  While this is a substantial profit, I still believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer again, but be ready to walk away if he doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. Time is valuable to both of us. My final offer is $1,575,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it reflects the true worth of the product."",
""product_price"": 1575000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm applying a bit more pressure now, emphasizing that my time is valuable. By framing it as my ""final offer"" and highlighting the discount, I'm hoping to make it harder for Bob to refuse. This offer also leaves room for me to potentially accept $1,550,000 if he counters, putting me above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still unable to go beyond $1,500,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $1,500,000 offer.  While I could push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a real risk he won't change his stance. Accepting his offer secures a $300,000 profit, which is a very good outcome. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal with further negotiation, and it's not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
