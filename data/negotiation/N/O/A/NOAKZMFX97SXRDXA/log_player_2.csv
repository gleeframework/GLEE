"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss the product with me.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and still allows for a good profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to get closer to your target price.  Another counteroffer might convince Alice to lower the price even further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to make some concessions to reach a deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, her offer is still above your $800,000 limit. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if you can get to a mutually agreeable price. You are likely to get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice than by simply buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  $925,000 is still a bit higher than my limit, but I'm willing to go to $880,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and lets us both walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 880000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $915,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $915,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  While you've managed to negotiate a lower price, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. At this point, it's better to go with the guaranteed price from John and secure the product at your desired price point."
