"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss the product with me.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and still allows for a good profit for me.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down in price.  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still trying to stay within my budget though.  Would you consider $900,000? This is a fair price that gives you a profit while allowing me to get the product within my range.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to make some concessions to reach a deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  $925,000 is still a bit higher than my limit, but I'm willing to go to $880,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and lets us both walk away happy.  What do you think?",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $915,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",915000.0,Alice,7,
