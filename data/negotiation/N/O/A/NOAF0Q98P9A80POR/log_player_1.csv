Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Stating I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can always sell to John for $8,000 gives me a fallback position if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but there's still room for improvement. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point by counteroffering.
* **Negotiation as a Strategy:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate and am willing to continue negotiating. 
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** Selling to John at this point would be settling for the bare minimum. I want to see if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning Provided:**  Explaining the rationale behind the new offer (fair compromise) makes it more appealing to Bob.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $9,250 is still well above my minimum of $8,000, ensuring a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but $9250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $9,250. It's a good deal, considering I was prepared to sell to John for $8,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a good profit.
* **Time Considerations:**  Further negotiation could be time-consuming and there's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer.  Accepting this offer secures the sale quickly."
