"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $1,350,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob might be able to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,225,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering we're both looking to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,150,000 doesn't reflect that. My final offer is $1,180,000. This is the lowest I can go while still feeling comfortable with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is $1,180,000. This is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Even though he's trying to save money, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the product to someone else.  Bob can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so that's the best option at this point."
