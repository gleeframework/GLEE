"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to me is $1,500,000, but I'm willing to make some concessions to get it to the right buyer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer because it's still above your budget. You should then make a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate further. You might be able to get a better price by making a counteroffer closer to your desired price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than previous offers, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price. You can also consider buying from John if you don't think you can get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the value it holds for me.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $1,025,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's in your best interest to buy the product from John for $800,000. You've already negotiated extensively with Alice, and you're unlikely to get a significantly better price.  It's time to move on to a more favorable option."
