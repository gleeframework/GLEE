"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not comfortable with $1,100,000. I can do $950,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
