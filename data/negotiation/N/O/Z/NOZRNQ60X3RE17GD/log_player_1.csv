Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows Alice to potentially maximize her profit. If Bob accepts, she earns more than selling to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The higher price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing within a profitable range for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, ensuring she doesn't lose out."
