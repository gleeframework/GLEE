Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $875,000. This accounts for its value while recognizing your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to counter with a price of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob reaching $800,000 puts him at my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth the risk of him walking away or the potential time lost in further negotiation. Accepting his offer now secures a good deal."
