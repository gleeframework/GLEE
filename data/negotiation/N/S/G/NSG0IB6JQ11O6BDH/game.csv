"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000? This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $800,000. How about $800,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
