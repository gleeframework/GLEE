"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This still gives you a good deal, and ensures I get a fair price for my product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $950000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to come down a little further. Let's meet at $1050000. This offers you a great value, and it allows me to secure a fair price for my product. I'm confident we can finalize a deal that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll propose a price of $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
