Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for you, and a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob, highlighting the ""great deal"" he's getting. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I clearly state I'm open to discussion, inviting Bob to respond. 

This approach allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, while also ensuring I'm not immediately selling for less than my minimum.  I'll be ready to counter his offer, or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting $900,000 would be a huge loss for me.  

I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still being open to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and ensures I get a fair price for my product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Budget:** I acknowledge his budget constraints to show understanding and maintain a positive tone.
* **Counter with Compromise:** I offer a price that's significantly higher than his offer but lower than my initial proposal, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value & Fairness:**  I emphasize that my counteroffer still gives him a ""good deal"" and ensures fairness for me.
* **Call for Compromise:** I invite Bob to find ""common ground"" to further the negotiation process.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, maintaining my profitability while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $950000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss for me. 

Instead, I will continue the negotiation with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price.  My goal is to secure a price closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to be flexible within reason."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to come down a little further. Let's meet at $1,050,000. This offers you a great value, and it allows me to secure a fair price for my product. I'm confident we can finalize a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Effort:**  I acknowledge Bob's persistence and willingness to negotiate to keep the conversation positive.
* **Offer a Slight Concession:**  I offer a small concession by dropping the price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price above Bob's previous offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize that my offer provides ""great value"" for Bob while ensuring a ""fair price"" for me. This highlights the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Call for Closure:**  I express confidence that a final deal can be reached, urging Bob to finalize the transaction.

By maintaining a slightly higher price, I aim to find a compromise point that aligns with my minimum while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll propose a price of $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, his final offer of $1,025,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to compromise any further at this point. 

Since I have a guaranteed sale to John at a price significantly higher than Bob's final offer, it's the most financially advantageous decision to sell the product to John.  This ensures I maximize my profit and avoid potentially prolonging negotiations with Bob that may not yield a satisfactory outcome."
