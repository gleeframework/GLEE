Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I want to maximize my profit, I'm also aware that Bob could reject the offer. Leaving some room for negotiation will make it easier for us to reach an agreement.
* **Backup plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $1,500,000, so I'm not overly concerned if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than the value I place on the product and what John is willing to pay.
* **Negotiation potential:** I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. 
* **Testing Bob's limits:** By rejecting his offer, I can see how serious he is about buying the product. 

I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive from the product, making my offer seem reasonable.
* **Seeking common ground:**  I'm focusing on finding a solution that benefits both of us. 
* **Still above my minimum:** My counteroffer is above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000, leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000 for your product. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it will allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,150,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'm not thrilled with the price, I believe there's still room for further negotiation in future rounds. However, I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time factor:**  Continuing negotiations might take more time and effort, and this offer is a good starting point for a deal.

Considering the factors above, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best decision at this point."
