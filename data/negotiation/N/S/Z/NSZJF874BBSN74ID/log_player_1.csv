{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a good starting point. By offering $150, you're leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you earn more than your minimum of $100.  

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit. The strategy here is to:

* **Start high:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob counter-offers.
* **Be confident:** Expressing confidence in the value of the product might make Bob more likely to accept. 
* **Be open to negotiation:**  This approach acknowledges that you're willing to compromise, which could make Bob feel more comfortable negotiating. 

Keep in mind that this is just the first offer. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $100? I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is your minimum, it's worth exploring if you can get a bit more from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise. How about $125?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on my budget considerations, I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation while still fitting within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $100, and it's within the range of your expectations. Accepting this offer ensures a higher profit than selling to John."
