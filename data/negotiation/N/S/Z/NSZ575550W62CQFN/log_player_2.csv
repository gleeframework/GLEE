It's better to reject the offer. $12,000 is over your budget, and you can still negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer and shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product.  I hope this will get us closer to a deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not willing to pay $10,500. I'm going to keep negotiating with Alice and try to get the price down further.  It's worth pushing to see if I can get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay John's price, but I'm hoping Alice will meet me halfway.  If she rejects this, I'll buy from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is only willing to go down by $50. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. I'll buy from John for $10,000, which is a better deal."
