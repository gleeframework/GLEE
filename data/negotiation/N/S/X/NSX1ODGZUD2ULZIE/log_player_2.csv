"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  While $1,300,000 is less than what John is offering, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so continuing the negotiation makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he's offering a price that's $200,000 lower than Alice's offer.  This is a substantial drop and could potentially entice Alice to negotiate further. This price is also well within Bob's budget, leaving some room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than what John is offering ($1,500,000) and is only slightly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer ($1,100,000).  At this point, it's unlikely that Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price, so accepting the offer is the best course of action to save money."
