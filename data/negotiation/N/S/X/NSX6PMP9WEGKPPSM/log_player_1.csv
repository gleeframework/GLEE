Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves a small window for potential haggling if he tries to lower the price. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $150 might make Bob feel like he's not getting any benefit and could lead to an immediate rejection.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
