"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1000000.  It's a fair price that reflects the potential benefits and allows us both to have a good deal.  Let's finalize this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
