"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still ensuring a profit above my minimum.  It also signals that I believe the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.  It shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible, but I also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $15,000. This is a significant drop from my last offer and shows Bob that I'm serious about selling. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. This ensures I get my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
