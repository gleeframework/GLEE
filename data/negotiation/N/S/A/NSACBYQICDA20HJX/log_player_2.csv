{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This is a great deal for Bob, but he can likely get an even better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

Bob is going to try to get a really good deal. This offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, and it's a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob still has a chance to get a better price. He's willing to pay more than his initial counteroffer but less than Alice's current offer. He'll try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

Bob is aiming for a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. He's hoping that Alice will be willing to compromise to reach a deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has already made significant progress in negotiations. While he can continue to try and push for a lower price,  accepting this offer from Alice is a good deal considering it's well below John's price and only $25,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  Further negotiation may not yield a significant enough price reduction to warrant the risk of losing the deal entirely."
