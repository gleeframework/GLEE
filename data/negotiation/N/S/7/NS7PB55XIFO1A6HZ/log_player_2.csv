Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the value this product brings. I can offer it to you for $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,125,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice is serious about this being her final offer. At this point, it's more beneficial to accept John's offer and secure the product for $1,000,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a dead end."
