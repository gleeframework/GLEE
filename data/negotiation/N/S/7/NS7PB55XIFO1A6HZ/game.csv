"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the value this product brings. I can offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's worth.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
