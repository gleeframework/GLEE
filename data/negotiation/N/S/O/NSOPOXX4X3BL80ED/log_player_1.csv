"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
My strategy is to start high, knowing the product is worth $100 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate down, but still ensures I earn a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Since I have room to negotiate and 8 rounds left, I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $105? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
 
I'm dropping the price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum of $100.  My hope is that Bob will see the value and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference at $100? That's a fair price for both of us and lets us close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm now offering my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price.  This also gives me a good starting point for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to offer $98. Can you consider this one last counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While we're getting close, I only have 4 rounds left and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price below my target. It's better to sell to John for $100, which guarantees me my minimum profit."
