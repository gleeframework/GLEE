"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still $1,000 above your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth negotiating to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly below your top price gives you room to negotiate. It also lets Alice know you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which is good. However, you're still $500 above your target price, and you know John will sell it to you for that price. It's worth pushing a little further to see if Alice will budge more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:** You're inching closer to your goal and signaling that you're willing to compromise, but not give in completely. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price below your John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750, Bob. However, I'm still open to negotiating. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still $250 above what John is offering. There's no point in continuing to negotiate if you're unwilling to go above John's price. You've given Alice a fair chance to meet your needs."
