"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe could significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its high value and unique features, I propose an initial offer of $15000. This reflects not only the cost and effort invested in creating it but also its potential impact on your business or life. I look forward to discussing how this product can benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $15,000 maximum, and Alice's initial offer is $15,000, there's no benefit to negotiating further. It's better to just buy from John for the same price."
