Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for profit:**  A higher price means a larger profit for me.
* **Unknown value to Bob:** I don't know how much Bob is willing to pay, so I'm starting high to see if I can negotiate a favorable deal.
* **John as a safety net:** I know John is willing to pay $1,200,000, so I have a guaranteed floor on the price.

**Strategy:**

By offering a higher price, I'm creating an incentive for Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects it, I can always fall back on John's offer. This approach allows me to maximize my potential profit while still having a backup plan in case Bob isn't interested."
