"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $13,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it falls within my budget and still allows you a profit.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm confident that $12,750 is a fair price that would benefit both of us.
