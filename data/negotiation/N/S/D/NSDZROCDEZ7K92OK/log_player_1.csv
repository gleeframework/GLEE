Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,750,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,500,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, so there's room for him to counteroffer.
* **It shows confidence:**  By starting high, you demonstrate your belief in the product's value.

It's important to be prepared for Bob's counteroffer, and to have a strategy for responding. You can either lower your price slightly or hold firm, depending on your confidence in the product and your desire to close the deal quickly. Remember, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to pay that much right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and selling to John for $1,500,000 would be a better outcome.  However, there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves some room for profit for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You've come down from your initial price, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Keeps the negotiation alive:** This gives Bob a chance to counter without feeling like he's been shut out.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  $1,600,000 is still above your minimum, but it leaves room for Bob to make a final counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to buy from John for that price if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is your minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair deal for both of you, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale to John."
