"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves some room for profit for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to buy from John for that price if we can't reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
