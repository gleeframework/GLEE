,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is far below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and provides you with a significant advantage. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from $2,000,000 to $1,700,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,400,000 is still below what I can accept.  This product is unique and offers significant benefits, which justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value and allows for a good return on your investment. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the value of the product, but I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is the right price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 still falls short of what I need to consider.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us to both achieve our goals.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.",1550000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,550,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,475,000.
