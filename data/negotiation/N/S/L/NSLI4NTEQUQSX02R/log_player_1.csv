Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.

By setting the initial price high, Alice increases the chances of getting a price closer to her desired amount, even if it means a little back-and-forth with Bob."
