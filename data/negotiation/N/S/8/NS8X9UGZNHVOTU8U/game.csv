"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. I know it's valuable to you, so I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,000 is still quite a distance from what I need to make this work.  My final offer is $11,500.  This is the best I can do and still feel good about the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
