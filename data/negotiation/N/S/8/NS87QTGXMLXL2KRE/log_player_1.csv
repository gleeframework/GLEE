Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is greater than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $3,000 difference between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **It's fair:** It's a compromise between your desired price and Bob's perceived value. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response and the ongoing negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John for $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price closer to my initial offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:**  $10,000 is a good compromise, closer to my desired price than Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that rejecting this offer could lead to further negotiation, potentially lowering the price further.
* **Value for time:**  It's important to consider the value of my time. Accepting this offer allows me to finalize the sale and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations.

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial $12,000 goal, $10,000 is a strong offer that ensures a sale at a price well above my minimum."
