Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, Alice subtly justifies the higher price without revealing her minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** Hinting at other interested buyers (""listing it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and competition.

While there's a chance Bob might reject this initial offer, Alice can always negotiate down closer to $8,000 if needed.  It's a calculated risk to maximize potential profit."
