"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to bring the price down, Bob, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with $1,075,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
