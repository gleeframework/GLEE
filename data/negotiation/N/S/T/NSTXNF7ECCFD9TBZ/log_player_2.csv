# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down closer to $800,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to bring the price down, Bob, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with $1,075,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $1,075,000.  Since you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to take that guaranteed deal and save the extra $75,000."
