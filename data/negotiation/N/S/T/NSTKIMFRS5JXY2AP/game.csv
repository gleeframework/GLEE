"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've described.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? It's a fair price considering the potential value of this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000. Let's try $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's try to reach an agreement here.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $975,000, which is $987,500. Let's try to meet in the middle again. What do you think?",987500.0,Alice,7,
