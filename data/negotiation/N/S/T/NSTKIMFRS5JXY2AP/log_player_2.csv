Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. My initial offer is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my budget of $800,000. It's too early to buy from John, as I might be able to get a better deal with Alice.  I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've described.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, but it's getting closer.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I believe I can negotiate a better price with Alice. I will reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? It's a fair price considering the potential value of this product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000. Let's try $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my $800,000 limit.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I believe I can still negotiate a lower price with Alice. I will reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's try to reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $975,000, which is $987,500. Let's try to meet in the middle again. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we are getting close to the end of the negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product, as I need it.  I've already made several counteroffers and it seems unlikely Alice will come down to my desired price. Therefore, I'll purchase the product from John for $800,000 to ensure I get it within my budget."
