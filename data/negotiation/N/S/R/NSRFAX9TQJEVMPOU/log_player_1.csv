Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

The product is worth significantly more to Bob, and I can likely secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low.  This product is worth significantly more to you than that, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground.

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my initial goal of $1,200,000 by continuing negotiations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective and I respect the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise. It's more than my minimum threshold, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit."
