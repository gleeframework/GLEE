"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, it's significantly below the value I hold for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the product's potential while allowing for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my willingness to make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
