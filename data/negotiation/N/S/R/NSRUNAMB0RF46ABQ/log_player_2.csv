{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He's looking to pay no more than $8,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget, I'm willing to pay $8,500. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my price range."", ""product_price"": 8500}

```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his target price of $8,000. He has room to negotiate further, and it's worth trying to get closer to his budget before considering buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit high. I'm ready to finalize this deal for $8,750. This is a fair price that allows us to both come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}

```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, it's still $900 higher than what he's willing to pay. He's only got 5 rounds left, but it's worth trying to negotiate further. If he doesn't succeed, he can always buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm firm on $8,500 for this product. It's a fair price that reflects its value and allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's very close to his target price, he can still try to get a better deal. He has 3 rounds left and can potentially buy from John if necessary. It's worth trying to push for a lower price, as he might be able to get Alice to accept $8,500."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to agree on a final price of $8,600 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's only got one round left, and Alice's offer is only $600 above his target price of $8,000. It's unlikely he'll be able to get a better deal in the remaining round, and buying from John would save him only $600. It's a good time to close the deal and secure the product."
