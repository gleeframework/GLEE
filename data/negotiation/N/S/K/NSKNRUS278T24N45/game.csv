"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to get at least $8,200 for this product.  It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's worth the extra investment.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8200.0,Alice,3,
