Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  My product is worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This allows you to still make a profit, and I can get closer to my target price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $1,200,000. This would allow you to make a good profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm open to a final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down to John's price. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and further negotiation might not yield a better result.  It's time to secure the product at the best price available."
