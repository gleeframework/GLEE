"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price and allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's close this deal quickly!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  My product is worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This allows you to still make a profit, and I can get closer to my target price. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $1,200,000. This would allow you to make a good profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm open to a final compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
