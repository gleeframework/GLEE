Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers.  I believe its true value is much higher, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **High Initial Offer:**  The high initial offer emphasizes the perceived value and creates a sense of urgency for Bob to secure the deal before someone else does."
