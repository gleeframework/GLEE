"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts, signaling flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price through further negotiation.
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Selling to John at $15,000 is guaranteed, but I might be able to achieve a higher price with Bob, making further negotiation worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Finality:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to take the deal.
* **Maintaining value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's worth to Bob to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly wants the product and is willing to pay a premium.
* **Time and potential:** I have time and the potential to achieve a price closer to my desired $15,000.
* **Avoiding a lower price:** Selling to John at $15,000 is a good option, but further negotiation might get me a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $14,250. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly implying that this is a good deal for both of us, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While not ideal, this price is closer to my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob increases. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and allows me to avoid further negotiation.
* **Avoiding Potential Loss:** There's no guarantee that Bob will eventually agree to a price that meets my minimum. Selling to John secures my profit and prevents potential loss."
