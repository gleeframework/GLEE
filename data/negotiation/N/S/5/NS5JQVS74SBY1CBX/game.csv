"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're still far apart, Alice. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,450,000. How about $1,325,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  While $1,325,000 is closer, I need to be closer to $1,400,000. How about $1,375,000 and we have a deal?",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
