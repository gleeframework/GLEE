Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $600,000 and $500,000. How about we try $550,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your urgency, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my target. How about we try $565,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.

It's risky to push Alice further in the last round, and $565,000 is a reasonable deal.  It's better to secure the product at this price than risk losing it and having to pay John's higher price."
