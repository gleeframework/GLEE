"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $80 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair price considering I'm willing to buy it right away. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is a bit closer to my minimum, I still have time to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'll counter with a price higher than his offer, but lower than my last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 just doesn't work for me. How about $105?  That's a significant drop from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $95? That's a good middle ground, and I'm ready to buy it now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $100. I'll counter with a price that's slightly lower than my last offer, but higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 100}
