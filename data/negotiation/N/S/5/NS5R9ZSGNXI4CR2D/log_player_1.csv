"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still space to lower the price if needed in subsequent rounds. 
* **Knowing my backup:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I can be firm if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly below my minimum price of $120 and even below the $80 value he perceives it to be.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I'm confident I can get a better price than $65, even if it takes a few more rounds. 
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum price gives me the confidence to keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob that he still gets a good deal at this price, even though it's more than he initially offered.
* **Positive tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open and positive.
* **Leaving room for adjustment:** While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still open to negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum price of $120, even though it's closer to my initial offer. 
* **Potential for better deal:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, indicating that there's still room for a higher price.
* **John is a reliable backup:**  I'm not desperate for a sale, so I can hold out for a better offer knowing that John is willing to buy at my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75, but I'm still hoping for something a little closer to $85.  Would you consider $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm only increasing my counteroffer by $5, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Positive reinforcement:** I reiterate that $80 is a ""fair price"" and emphasize the quality of the product to justify the price.
* **Clear communication:** I'm keeping the message concise and straightforward, focusing on the price and leaving room for Bob to respond.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm still open to negotiation if Bob isn't willing to go as high as $80."
