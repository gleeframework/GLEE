"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75, but I'm still hoping for something a little closer to $85.  Would you consider $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think!",80.0,Alice,5,
