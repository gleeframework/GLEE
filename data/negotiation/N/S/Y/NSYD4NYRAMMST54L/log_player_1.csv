"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiations. I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to entice him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $13000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and there's still room for compromise.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This still represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my desired range. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am still working within my budget constraints. Could we possibly agree on $13200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only slightly below my minimum and the negotiation process has taken several rounds.  It's better to secure a sale now than to risk further rejection and potentially have to sell to John at a lower profit."
