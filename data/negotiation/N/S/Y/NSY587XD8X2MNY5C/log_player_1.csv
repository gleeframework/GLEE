Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, and still allows me to make a good profit. I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John is offering, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob is unwilling to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$800,000 is far too low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to make more than $1,000,000, Bob's offers are consistently too low, and I don't want to risk a lengthy negotiation that could potentially yield even lower offers. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and a quick sale."
