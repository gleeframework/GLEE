"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can do better. He has a higher maximum price than Alice's minimum price, so there's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. The price is within his budget, and it's lower than what John is selling for.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $1,350,000.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk losing it and having to pay more to John."
