"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above the product's worth to her ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* It's better to try to get a lower price than settle for $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price significantly, and the current offer is only $75,000 more than her estimated worth of the product. 
*  This is a good deal for Bob, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in more back-and-forth without significant price drops.
*  Buying from John for $1,200,000 would be much more expensive."
