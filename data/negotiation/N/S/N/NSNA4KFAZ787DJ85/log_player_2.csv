"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for a guaranteed $80 from John.  There's no point in even trying to negotiate with Alice when you have a better option available."
