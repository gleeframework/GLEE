Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the value to you (Alice), framing the offer around the ""value"" helps justify the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning that you'll list it publicly (or subtly implying other buyers exist) creates a sense of urgency and competition for Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards, but you can't go back up after a lower offer."
