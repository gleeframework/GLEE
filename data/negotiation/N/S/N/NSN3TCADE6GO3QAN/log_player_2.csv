"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,000,000.  I believe it has the potential to significantly benefit your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is above my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual budget ($800,000) to leave room for negotiation and gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Leaving Room to Move:** This initial offer allows me to gradually increase my bid in subsequent rounds if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This low offer will help me understand how eager Alice is to sell and how much lower she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,000,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to facilitate a deal. I believe this offer still reflects a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice decreased her offer significantly, which indicates she's willing to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 is still far above both my initial offer and my maximum budget.  I need to show Alice that I'm serious about a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I can offer you $700,000 to make this deal happen. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I've increased my offer by $100,000 to demonstrate that I'm willing to move closer to her price.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  The new offer is still below my maximum budget, leaving some room for a final negotiation.
* **Mentioning Market Value:** I'm subtly reminding Alice that there are other options available (like John), even though I haven't explicitly threatened to walk away yet."
