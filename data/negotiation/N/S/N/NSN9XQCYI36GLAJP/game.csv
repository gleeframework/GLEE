"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value the product has for me. However,  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to you and my budget constraints.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
