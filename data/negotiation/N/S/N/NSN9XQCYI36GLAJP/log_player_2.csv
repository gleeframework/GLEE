"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept because it's below the product's true value to you, it's important to remember you can get it for your maximum budget from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to pay more than my budget allows. Rejecting the offer gives me another chance to negotiate a lower price.  I'll aim for something closer to $1,300,000 in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,320,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer than before, I'm not willing to go beyond my budget limit.  John is offering the product for my maximum budget, so it makes more sense to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
