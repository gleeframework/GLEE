"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product worth at least $1000000 to me.  I'm confident it would be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $1500000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, my budget allows for a maximum expenditure of $800000. I believe this aligns more closely with what I am willing to invest. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling the product for $1200000. This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment while acknowledging your limitations. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me and my budgetary constraints, I am willing to propose a price of $1000000. I hope this offers a fair compromise between our positions.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
