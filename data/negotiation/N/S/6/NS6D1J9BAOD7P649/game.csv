"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's currently valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the potential benefits you'll experience, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of what the product is truly worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a considerable compromise. This price still allows me to gain a reasonable return on my investment, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I'm confident that this price is a fair reflection of the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment if we can agree on this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
