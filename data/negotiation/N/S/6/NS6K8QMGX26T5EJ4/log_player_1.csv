"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's closer to my value of $10,000. Bob knows the product is worth less to him, so I'm hoping to push him to negotiate. If he rejects, we'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm moving a bit closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the product's value.  I'm hoping this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and we're already at round 4.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I'm  risk averse to losing the deal entirely.  Accepting $9,800 is a good outcome for me."
