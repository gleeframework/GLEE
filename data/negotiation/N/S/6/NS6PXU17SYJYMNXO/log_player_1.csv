Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit more in the next round."

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, I still feel I can get a better deal. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Would you be willing to go down to $105 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiations, and Bob keeps offering $105. While it's tempting to try and squeeze out a few more dollars, I'm going to take the sure thing with John and sell him the product for $150.  I've already lost several rounds trying to get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price or losing out on the sale entirely."
