"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you won't regret.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",12250.0,Bob,4,
