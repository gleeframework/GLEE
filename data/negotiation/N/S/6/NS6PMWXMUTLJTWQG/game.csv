"Thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. I've carefully considered our conversation and am willing to increase my offer to $15000. This still represents a significant discount from your original asking price, and I hope this will be acceptable.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $15000. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, which is a compromise between our last two offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,5,
