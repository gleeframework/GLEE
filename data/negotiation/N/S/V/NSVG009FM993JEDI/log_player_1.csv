Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe it will be very valuable for you. "",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000, but that doesn't dictate our starting point. We want to maximize our potential profit.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high price like $19,000 sets an anchor. Even if Bob doesn't accept this initial price, it sets the stage for negotiation and makes lower offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $15,000.
* **Backup Plan (John):**  We have a safety net. If Bob rejects our offers, we can sell to John for our minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. We are prepared to negotiate with Bob to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
