"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know is worth at least $10,000 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500.  This is a great deal, as I know you value it highly. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is emphasizing your perceived value of the product, her offer is higher than what you can get it for from John. You know John will sell it to you for $10,000, making that the better option.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price or you can simply buy it from John and save $500."
