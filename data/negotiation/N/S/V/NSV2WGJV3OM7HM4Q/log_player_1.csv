Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $1,200,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:**  Mentioning the value the product holds for Bob emphasizes the potential benefit he'll gain from acquiring it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential compromise. 
* **Plan B:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $800,000 gives me the confidence to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is too low:** While it's above my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'm aiming for.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, so there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my ideal target. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $800,000 gives me the flexibility to be firm with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Considering the substantial value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still allows for a good profit margin for me, while also making this a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from the initial offer.
* **Appeal to value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Balanced approach:** $1,000,000 is a significant amount for Bob, but it's still closer to my desired price than his offer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting his offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate and have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $950,000 is only $50,000 away from my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000.  
* **Significantly Above Minimum:**  This price is well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  While Bob seems hesitant to go higher, there's always the possibility of future negotiations if I maintain a relationship with him. 
* **Time is a Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on and potentially lead to a stalemate.  It's time to secure a deal and move forward."
