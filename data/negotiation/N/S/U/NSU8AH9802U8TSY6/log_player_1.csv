Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'd accept. There's no room for negotiation left with him.
