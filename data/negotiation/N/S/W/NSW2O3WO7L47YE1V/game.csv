"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825,000. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $760,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $795,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",795000.0,Alice,5,

"I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than $820,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.",820000.0,Alice,7,
