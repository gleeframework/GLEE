Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, getting Bob to buy it allows us to maximize profit.
* **High but Reasonable:** $11,000 is a high price, but it's still a significant discount from John's offer. This makes it more tempting for Bob.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning listing the product publicly, we create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly."
