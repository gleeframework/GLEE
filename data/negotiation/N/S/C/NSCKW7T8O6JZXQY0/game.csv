"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $13,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
