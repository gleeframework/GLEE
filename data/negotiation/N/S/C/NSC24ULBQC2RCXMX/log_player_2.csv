"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. I understand it's a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects its worth. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise I'll be moving forward with another buyer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
