Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that gives me a good profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation if he's not satisfied with the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer $115, accepting Bob's offer for $110 is still a good outcome. It's above my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for more, potentially leading to a counteroffer from Bob that is lower than $110 or even a rejection of my counteroffer."
