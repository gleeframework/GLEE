"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and highly valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a generous offer to get the ball rolling. I'm offering the product to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the exclusivity and the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget is quite limited. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to $1500000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're working with a limited budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort to meet halfway, I still believe that the product's true value aligns more closely with my budget. I propose a final offer of $1600000. This price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and my financial constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your latest offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This price is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1625000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1675000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good value for the product. What do you think?",1675000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to negotiate, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's minimum value. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1700000, which is the same price I offered in Round 3. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider other options. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,9,
