Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is the highest you can go, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this level. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

Alice is clearly holding firm to a price above $1,050,000.  While I could try another counteroffer, there's a risk she won't budge and I'll end up having to go with John anyway.  $1,080,000 is a reasonable compromise to ensure I get the product."
