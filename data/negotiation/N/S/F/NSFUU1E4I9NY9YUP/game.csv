"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be open to $750,000? That's a significant investment on my end, but I believe it's a fair price.",750000.0,Bob,4,

If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this negotiation has been helpful in understanding the value of the product.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify going above $780,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. ",780000.0,Bob,6,
