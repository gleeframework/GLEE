Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your transparency, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $790,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you a price of $805,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $805,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $805,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a hard line and is unlikely to go below $800,000. Knowing you have an alternative at $800,000, it's no longer beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John saves you $5,000 and avoids the risk of Alice sticking to her ""final offer""."
