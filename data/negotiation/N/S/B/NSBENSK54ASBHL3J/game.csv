"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would allow us both to get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $825,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",825000.0,Bob,4,
