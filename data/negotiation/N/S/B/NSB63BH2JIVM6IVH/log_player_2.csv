**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to get a profit margin. 
* You have a better alternative with John, even though it's your maximum budget.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or create an opportunity for her to make a counter-offer closer to your ideal range."
