"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm starting with a price of $1200000. This reflects the value I've placed on it and gives us room to negotiate a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. How about we aim for $950000? I appreciate your understanding.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is closer to your valuation, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000,  which reflects a reasonable compromise. This allows us both to gain something valuable from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Considering your offer and my valuation, I think we could agree on $1000000. It's a fair price that respects both our perspectives. I hope you'll consider this proposal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
