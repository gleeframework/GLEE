Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, as John guarantees that amount.
* **Bob's Perspective:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I need to leave room for him to see a profit margin.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

By offering the product at $1,450,000, I leave a potential profit of $450,000 for Bob while securing a significant profit for myself."
