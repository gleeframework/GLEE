"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"You're right, $9,500 is a fair compromise, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. Would you be willing to do $10,500? That's only slightly above your last offer and gets us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I'm eager to buy this product, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $9,750? It's a good compromise for both of us and could lead to a successful deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
