"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,000. I believe this product will bring you a lot of value.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  Let's try this - $14,000 and we have a deal. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to find a good home for the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,000 is still a stretch for me. I'd be willing to go up to $7,500, but that's really my limit.",7500.0,Bob,6,
