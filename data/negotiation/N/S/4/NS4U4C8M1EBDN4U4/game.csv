"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1275000. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $1275000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but no higher. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept.
