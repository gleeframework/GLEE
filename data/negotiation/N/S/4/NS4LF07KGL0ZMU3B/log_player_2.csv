"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable product for a price that's significantly below its market value. While I value this product at no less than $1,500,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly.  If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's market value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for a significantly lower price."
