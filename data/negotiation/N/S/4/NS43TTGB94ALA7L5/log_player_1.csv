{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob wants to counteroffer, while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, so I'm going to reject it. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
