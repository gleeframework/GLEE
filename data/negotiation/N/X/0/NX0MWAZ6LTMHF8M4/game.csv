"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,000? This is a fantastic product and I think you'll agree it's worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm still looking to keep the price below $9,000 if possible. Could you consider $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 still isn't quite there for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering you the product for $8,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
