"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  It's still early in the negotiation, and Bob has several rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant premium for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  He's aiming for a price significantly lower than $900,000, and there are still several rounds of negotiation remaining.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer again and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This shows I'm serious about acquiring the product, but we need to find a price point that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm also willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle at $887,500. This is a very fair offer considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and it's within Bob's budget.  While he could potentially negotiate a lower price, it's likely that further negotiation will be incremental, and accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
