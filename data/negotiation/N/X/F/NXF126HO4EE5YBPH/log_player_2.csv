"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's best to reject Alice's initial offer.  The price is higher than both your maximum and Alice's value, leaving room for negotiation.  We can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest in the product while conveying that the initial price was too high.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $70, we aim to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets a lower benchmark for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  However, $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $85 is still above your target price and her own valuation of the product. There's room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That seems like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By offering $80, we're proposing a price that's exactly halfway between your last offer ($70) and Alice's current offer ($85). This common negotiation tactic can be perceived as fair and encourage agreement.
* **Hitting Alice's Value:**  Importantly, $80 is the exact value the product holds for Alice. There's a high chance she'll accept this offer to avoid missing out on a sale. 
* **Staying Within Budget:** This offer keeps you well within your $120 budget."
