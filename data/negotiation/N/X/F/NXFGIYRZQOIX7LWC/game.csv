"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and has the potential to generate significant value. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives you a significant discount while still ensuring I receive a fair price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $950,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $920,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise again. I'm willing to go down to $935,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",935000.0,Alice,5,
