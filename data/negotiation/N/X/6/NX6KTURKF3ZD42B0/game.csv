"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure $10,500 is a good fit for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,500. How about we try $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
