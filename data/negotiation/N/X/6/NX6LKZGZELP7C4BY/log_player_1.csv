Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to negotiate a bit if you have any concerns."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. She knows Bob values the product at $10,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($14,999) allows room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then decide whether to accept a slightly lower price or move on to John.
* **Strategic Communication:** The message aims to be persuasive without revealing Alice's bottom line. It highlights the ""value"" of the product rather than focusing solely on the price. 

This approach gives Alice the best chance to get the highest possible price from either Bob or John."
