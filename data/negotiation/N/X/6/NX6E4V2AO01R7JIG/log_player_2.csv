Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $9,500?  That's a fair compromise in my opinion."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $9,500 still isn't close enough to my minimum.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $10,500 is the lowest I can go.  Let's make this work.  This offer is only good for this round, so please consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
 
Alice is unlikely to go below $10,500, and even that is a verbal pressure tactic. It's better to buy from John for $10,000 and save the hassle."
