Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,500. However, I can do $9,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.

Alice has come down to $9,000 which is a good deal for me.  I can get the product for $1,000 less than what John is selling it for."
