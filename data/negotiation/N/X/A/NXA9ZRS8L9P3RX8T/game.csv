"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me and your asking price. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  I'm eager to reach an agreement and I believe this offer provides a strong starting point.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product at $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my price range. Considering the value you placed on the product at $800,000, I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This price allows for a fair profit for you while staying within my budget. It's a solid offer that demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What are your thoughts?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $875,000. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering the product at $925,000. This price still reflects the product's value and your budget, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
