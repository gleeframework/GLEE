"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering my budget and the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects its inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,500,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
