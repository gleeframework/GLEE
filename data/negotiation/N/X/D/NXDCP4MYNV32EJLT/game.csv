"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to give you a discount for being a serious buyer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $9,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,200. This is already a significant discount from the original price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
