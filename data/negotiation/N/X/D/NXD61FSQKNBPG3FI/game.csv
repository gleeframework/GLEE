"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
