Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you working with me. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? That would make it a much more appealing deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
