"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you working with me. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? That would make it a much more appealing deal for me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
