Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $130 is a bit low, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?

``` 
This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $132 is still a significant profit margin above your minimum ($120).
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away. John's offer of $120 is a safety net, but $132 is a better outcome. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further haggling is unlikely to yield a much better price, and might sour the deal.
