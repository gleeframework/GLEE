Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you want to start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still ensuring a profit margin above your minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message highlights the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob's perception. 
* **Exclusive opportunity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This approach aims to maximize your profit while leaving a small possibility of Bob accepting. If he rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired price."
