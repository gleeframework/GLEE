Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

This offer is higher than Bob's valuation, but significantly lower than my minimum price. This is a starting point to gauge Bob's interest and initiate negotiation. I'm hoping to push for a higher price, but if Bob rejects, I'm prepared to consider his counteroffer and potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, even considering his valuation of the product.  While I want to maximize my profit, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss.  I will counter-offer and attempt to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial proposal, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It's a middle ground that gives Bob room to counter while still securing a substantial profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount.  I will make a counteroffer and continue negotiations, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm sticking with a counteroffer that's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer but lower than my previous counteroffer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and hoping to close the gap between our offers.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for anything below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is edging closer to a more acceptable price, it's still far from my minimum.  I've made several counteroffers and am  not confident that further negotiations with Bob will yield a satisfactory outcome.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, ensuring I meet my minimum price target."
