"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $900,000 is within Bob's budget, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so offering $850,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This offer is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for Alice to counter if she wishes."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her initial offer. While Bob is still within his budget, Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's current offer and closer to Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is increasing, which is a sign she's not as motivated to sell at a lower price. However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down.  Buying from John at this point would be a bad decision as it would be more expensive than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer, but still keeping it below $900,000.  He's showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.  The $5000 increase from the previous round signals a desire to close the deal, but not at any price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are steadily increasing, making it unlikely she will come down to a price that is significantly lower than her current offer.  With only three rounds left, Bob needs to make a decision. While he could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will reject his counteroffer and then offer a price even higher than her current $970,000 offer.  At this point, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the safer option. It guarantees Bob will get the product and it is still within his budget, even though it is a higher price than he hoped for."
