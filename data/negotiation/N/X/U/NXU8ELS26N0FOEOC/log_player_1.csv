Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your operations.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the benefits for Bob, highlighting the value and the potential of the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering a price below my minimum of $1,000,000, I create an opportunity for a successful negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John, who is guaranteed to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest, and I believe I can secure a price closer to my goal by making a counteroffer.
* **Risk of losing to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that amount with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from this product.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price to $900,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value for Bob and framing the price as a good deal for him.
* **Openness to Further Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer even further, potentially leading to a price below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,000,000, eliminating the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll sell the product to John, ensuring I receive the maximum possible value for it.  While I was hoping to get closer to $1,000,000 with Bob, securing that amount with John is a safer and more certain option."
