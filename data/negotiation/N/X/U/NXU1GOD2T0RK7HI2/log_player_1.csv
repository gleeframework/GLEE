Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have room to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to pay a premium. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know about your guaranteed offer from John. If Bob knew about John's offer, he'd be unlikely to offer more than $1,000,000."
