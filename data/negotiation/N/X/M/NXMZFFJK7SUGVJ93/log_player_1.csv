Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to me, while still allowing you a respectable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,900,000 represents the high end of my expectations,  $1,300,000 falls quite short.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,650,000?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  Let's try to bridge the gap further.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This would allow us both to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark I need. I'd rather take the guaranteed offer from John at this point to avoid further negotiation and potential loss."
