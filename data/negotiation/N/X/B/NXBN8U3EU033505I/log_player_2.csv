"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $9,500 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,200?"",
""product_price"": 8200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value ($8,000) but well below her initial asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling our interest.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is courteous and explains that while the product is appealing, the initial price point doesn't work for us. 
* **Strategic Goal:**  Our ideal outcome is to get the price closer to $8,000 without pushing Alice away completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,700.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice moved from $9,500 to $8,700, indicating she's willing to bargain. There's a chance we can bring the price down further.
* **Alternative Exists:**  We have the safety net of buying from John at $10,000, so we can afford to be a little more assertive in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,450? That's a significant discount from your original offer."",
""product_price"": 8450
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer ($8,200) and her current price ($8,700). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Highlighting the Discount:** By mentioning the significant discount from her original price, we subtly remind Alice of the value we're getting.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We're still a fair distance from John's $10,000 offer, giving us some leverage to continue negotiating with Alice."
