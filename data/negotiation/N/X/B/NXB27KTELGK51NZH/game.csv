"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, your initial price is unfortunately well beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its potential benefits to me. This offer is a significant step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the unique advantages this product offers and allows us both to benefit.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  To find common ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to move forward with this transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
