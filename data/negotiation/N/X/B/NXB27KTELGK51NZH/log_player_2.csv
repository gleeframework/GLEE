"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's way above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's a good starting point to reject the offer and counter with a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, your initial price is unfortunately well beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its potential benefits to me. This offer is a significant step towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in wanting the product but also setting a firm boundary.
* **Justified offer:** Bob provides a reason for his offer, emphasizing the ""potential benefits"" to him, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  While this counteroffer is close to Bob's limit, it still allows for further negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the unique advantages this product offers and allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better for Bob to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  The fact that Alice is willing to negotiate shows that there's still room for a deal that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  To find common ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to move forward with this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Bob increases his offer significantly, demonstrating his willingness to compromise and showing that he's taking Alice's perspective into account.
* **Stressing fairness:** Bob frames the offer as ""fair"" to both parties, highlighting a sense of mutual benefit. 
* **Strategic approach:**  Bob is aiming for a deal within his budget but also leaving room for some negotiation in the remaining rounds."
