Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down, the offer ensures a profit significantly higher than John's offer ($1,000,000).

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of securing a deal with Bob."
