"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.** This means you can purchase the product and still save money.
* **Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,000,000).** This suggests a potential for further negotiation, but the difference is not significant enough to risk losing the deal.

While buying from John for $1,200,000 would guarantee you the product, accepting Alice's offer allows you to save $50,000."
