Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 with John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder in your pricing.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:**  The message is straightforward and highlights the product's value.
* **Strong Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin ($150,000 above your minimum) while still offering Bob a substantial discount ($50,000 less than his perceived value). 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive price might be favorable.

**Remember:** This is just one approach. The specific price and message you choose should be tailored to your knowledge of Bob and your overall business goals."
