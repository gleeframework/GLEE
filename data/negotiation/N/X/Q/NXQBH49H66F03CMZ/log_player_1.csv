"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  This leaves room for potential compromise while still getting a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $175 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $150 and allows me to make a profit. I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the next rounds, so I'll accept it."
