Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to aim higher with Bob. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($18,000) allows room for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price higher than your baseline of $10,000.
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you create a subtle sense of urgency and potential competition.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting your initial offer and potentially negotiating."
