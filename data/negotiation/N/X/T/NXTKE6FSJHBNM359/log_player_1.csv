Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for a bit more, $87.50 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
