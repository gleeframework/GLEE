"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I value your offer, the product's value is considerably higher. Could you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,500. Can we meet in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we settle at $11,500? This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
