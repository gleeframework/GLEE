"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,050,000. Would that work for you?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $1,080,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come up a bit.  How about $1,070,000 and we have a deal?",1070000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking of a price of $1,090,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's worth considering. Let's meet at this price and finalize the deal.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
