"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good price, there's room for improvement.  You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  You are aiming for a price closer to your $1,000,000 limit.  Buying from John is always a safe option, but let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant increase from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price.  While I would prefer to get closer to $900,000, accepting the offer at $850,000 is a good deal. It's a significant savings over John's price and still within my budget.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
