"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I can't accept a price that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth and leaves us both with a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
