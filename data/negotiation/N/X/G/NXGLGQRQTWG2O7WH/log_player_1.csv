Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.

While Bob is getting closer, the negotiations are moving slowly and it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
