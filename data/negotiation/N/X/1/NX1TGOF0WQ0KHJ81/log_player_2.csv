"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering Alice's minimum value of $8,000. This counteroffer leaves space for further negotiation while still allowing Bob to save a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm confident this product will bring you a significant return, well beyond the $12,000 mark. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's price point, but $13,000 is still too high.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to get the best possible deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your confidence in the product, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, demonstrating his commitment to getting a good deal.  By offering $12,500, he's showing flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation.  This counteroffer is a good compromise, meeting Alice halfway while still ensuring a significant saving for Bob."
