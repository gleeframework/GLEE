"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $8500. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price of $8000.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad you're serious about purchasing the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8000 just yet. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $8200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I don't think I can go as high as $8200. I'm willing to meet you at $7800, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $7800. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $8100. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that I'm getting a bit too close to the price I'd be willing to pay to John, and I'm not sure I want to go that high. I'm willing to meet you at $7500, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8050. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. What do you think?",8050.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, and I'm really not willing to go above $7500. I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this deal if we can't meet at that price. I appreciate the negotiation, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere for the product.",7500.0,Bob,10,
