"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you get a valuable product at a price below its worth to you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I understand the product is worth less to you, but it's still a valuable asset. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This gives you a significant discount and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
