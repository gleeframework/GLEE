"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $700,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $650,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $600,000. Would you be open to that?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with. However, $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $620,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",620000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work.  How about $610,000?",610000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $615,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",615000.0,Alice,7,
