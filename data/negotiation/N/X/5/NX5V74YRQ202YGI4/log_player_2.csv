"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is highly valued by its users. Considering its quality and features, we believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay based on your assessment. However, I'm confident in presenting an offer that could be mutually beneficial. Would you like to consider purchasing the product for $135? This price reflects the value we place on the item while allowing you to acquire it at a reasonable cost. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $135 is still more than your $120 limit and what John is offering. You can try to negotiate a better price with Alice, but you have a guaranteed option with John at your desired price."
