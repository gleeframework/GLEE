"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your budget. It's always worth negotiating, especially when there's an alternative seller.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to create room for negotiation. This counteroffer is still within my budget, but it's a big step down from $2,000,000.  I expect Alice to counter with a higher price, and I'll adjust my offers accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but closer to my target.  There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a better price.  I want to avoid buying from John right now because I might be able to secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer from the previous round, but still keeping it below my budget and John's price.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  I'm hoping this will push Alice closer to a price I'm willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  I'm not ready to buy yet because I think I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but still keeping it below John's price.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm not willing to go above my budget.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Alice to accept my offer.  If she rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John, as we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now below John's price, and is within my budget.  While I would prefer to pay even less, it's getting close to my target and I'm concerned I might lose out on a good deal if I keep rejecting.  It's better to take the deal now than risk having to buy from John at a higher price."
