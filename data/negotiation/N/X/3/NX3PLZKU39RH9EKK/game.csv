"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify a price closer to my valuation. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting both our valuations.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to negotiate further, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $10,500. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the price I'm willing to accept.",10500.0,Alice,5,
