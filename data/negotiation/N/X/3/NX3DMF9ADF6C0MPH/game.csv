"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm ready to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
