"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. It leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense that there's value to be gained."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95 for the product. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps the price closer to my desired target. I believe this is a fair price, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Although $92 is still less than my initial offer, it's very close to it and it's  a good deal for me. I'm not sure if I can get a higher price in the next round, so I'm taking the deal to avoid potentially ending up with only $80 from John."
