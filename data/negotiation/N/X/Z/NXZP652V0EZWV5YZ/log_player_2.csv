Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,000, so I'll sell the product to you for $8,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,750, so I'll sell the product to you for $8,125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it's unlikely she'll go below $8,000.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal now rather than risk Alice not going low enough."
