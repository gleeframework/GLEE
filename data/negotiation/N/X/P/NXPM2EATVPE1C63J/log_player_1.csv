Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum acceptable price. I need to negotiate upwards from here."

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $1,250,000 is better, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting very close to a price that makes this a worthwhile deal for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,250,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. He's unlikely to go any higher, and $1,225,000 is a reasonable profit above my minimum. Holding out for more might risk losing him altogether."
