"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than $150, there's still room to negotiate. You can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is a good price considering your maximum budget is $150. While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and then potentially raising her price again is high. Accepting the offer at $115 is a good compromise and ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
