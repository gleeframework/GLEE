"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's preferred price of $1,000,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making a new counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that respects both of our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1050000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While there's always a chance of continuing to negotiate, it's likely that Alice is firm on her price.  Since Bob can secure the same product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
