"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her actual value of the product, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can get the product for a lower price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
