"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I'm not willing to go below $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12,000. This is a significant concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $11,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a good deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
