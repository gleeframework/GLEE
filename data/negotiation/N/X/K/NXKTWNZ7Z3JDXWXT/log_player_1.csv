Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is truly significant, and I can't go as low as $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking below our minimum acceptable price. While there's room for negotiation, it's unlikely he'll reach $800,000 quickly. Selling to John guarantees our minimum price and avoids further haggling."
