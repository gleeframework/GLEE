"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still below my minimum acceptable value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging a positive response. 
* **Strategy:** I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much room I have to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I have 9 rounds left, and there's a good chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for something closer to $11,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer. I'm still below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also showing flexibility.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and indicating that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, and I believe that a counteroffer of $11,000 is a good starting point. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my ideal price of $15,000. I want to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I have 6 rounds left to work with, and there's still a good chance of getting a better offer. Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,500. This would be a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing the price again, but still below my minimum acceptable price, aiming to bridge the gap between our offers. 
* **Message:** I'm still acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the value of the product, creating a sense of compromise.
* **Strategy:** I'm hoping to find a sweet spot where Bob feels comfortable with the price while still maximizing my earnings. With 5 rounds left, I need to find a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the value of the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  With 4 rounds left, I have time to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'm still hopeful that I can get a price closer to $11,000 or even higher. Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $9800.  This would be a fair compromise, and it's a price I can accept. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, but still a bit higher than he's currently willing to pay. This demonstrates flexibility while keeping the price above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to sound more agreeable while reminding him that I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Strategy:** I'm hoping to find a price that both of us can agree on. With only 3 rounds left, I need to be strategic about my counteroffers. If Bob still refuses, I'll have to decide if I want to sell to John or risk losing the sale altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the price negotiations have stalled, and Bob's offer of $8,800 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's unlikely that we'll be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I meet my minimum financial goal. This is the most sensible decision given the current circumstances and the limited time remaining."
