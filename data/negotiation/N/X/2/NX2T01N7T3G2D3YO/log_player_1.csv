Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my earnings.  However, I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.  I'll keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as my ""floor"" price."
