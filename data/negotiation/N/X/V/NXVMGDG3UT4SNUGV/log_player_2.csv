"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your target of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is only $75,000 more than your target price from John.  It's worth considering that you have 7 more rounds to negotiate, and you might be able to squeeze out a better price, but the risk is that Alice could counter with a higher price and ultimately force you to pay more than you want.  

It's a strategic decision, but accepting Alice's offer is the safest option at this point, as it secures a good price and minimizes your risk."
