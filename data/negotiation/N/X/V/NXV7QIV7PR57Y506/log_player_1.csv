{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is a good starting point considering my minimum is $150, and John is willing to pay that. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $130, I leave room for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Positive Approach:** My message is friendly and focuses on the potential value Bob will get from the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even lower than what John is offering. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While $90 is better than nothing, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John guarantees $150, but rejecting Bob's offer allows for the possibility of a higher sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise,  higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and respectful tone, emphasizing the value Bob will get at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, so I'm offering $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $100 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $100, potentially getting closer to my target. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John guarantees $150, but rejecting Bob's offer keeps the possibility of a higher sale with Bob open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. I'm willing to go down to $105, which is a fair price for both of us. This allows me to make a profit while giving you a good price on this amazing product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One More Compromise:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's latest offer but still below my previous counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Close to Minimum:**  $105 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's also close enough to Bob's offer that he might be willing to accept it.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's final offer of $95 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **No Further Negotiation:** It seems Bob is unwilling to budge further, and a counteroffer from me might just push him away.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money. It's a safer choice than risking further negotiation with Bob."
