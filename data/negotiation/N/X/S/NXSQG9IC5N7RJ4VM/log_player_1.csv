"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives us room to negotiate, and I want to see how much he's willing to pay.  If he rejects, I'll lower my price slightly in the next round, but still aim to make a profit above my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, and I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $16,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be more appealing than his offer, but if he rejects it, I'll have to reassess my strategy and possibly consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to $15,000 in the next round.  If he continues to offer low prices, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm lowering the price to $14,500.  This is still a decent profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. However, I'm starting to get nervous. I only have a few rounds left, and if Bob rejects this offer, I might have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm getting nervous that Bob won't come up to my minimum price. I've already dropped my price considerably, and I don't think I can go any lower.  To secure a decent profit and avoid risking losing out completely, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
