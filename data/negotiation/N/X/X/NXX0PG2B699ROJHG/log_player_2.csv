# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

This product is way over your budget, and Alice's starting offer is far too high.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best option to try to get a better price."

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's getting closer to my budget, but it's worth trying to see if we can negotiate further. I'll reject and send another counteroffer."
