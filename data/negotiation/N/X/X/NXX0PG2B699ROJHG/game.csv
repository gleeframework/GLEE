"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my best offer, considering the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $1,100,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver substantial returns on your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a fair compromise, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer.  Let me know if you're open to this.",950000.0,Bob,4,
