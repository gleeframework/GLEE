You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Accepting Alice's offer is the best option because it allows Bob to buy the product for $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than what he would pay to John. Even though it's more than the product's worth to Alice, it's still within Bob's budget and saves him money."
