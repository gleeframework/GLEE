"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more than that to me.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I have to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However,  $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,875?  I'm willing to go down a little further, but I need to stay above that figure.  What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750 again, but I'd like to throw in a small concession - I'll also take the product with a 1-year warranty. Can you meet me at $8,750 with the warranty included?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the offer of a warranty, it's a great perk. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800 with the warranty included. That's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the warranty a valuable addition. What do you say?",8800.0,Alice,7,
