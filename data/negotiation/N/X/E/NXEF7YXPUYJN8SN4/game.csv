"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm happy to pay $15,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is your top budget, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product you want. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
