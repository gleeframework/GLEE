"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs for this high-quality product.  How about we split the difference at $112.50?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and you'd still be getting a great value.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $112.50 is closer, my budget really is firm at $100.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering I'm saving you the hassle of finding another buyer.",100.0,Bob,6,
