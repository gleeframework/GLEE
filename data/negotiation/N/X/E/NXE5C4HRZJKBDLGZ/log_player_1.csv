"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll be watching Bob's response carefully to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a good offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll need to be strategic and not give up too much ground in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still ensuring I earn more than the $12,000 I would get from John. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round. I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, but I don't want to settle for anything too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, but I still want to ensure a decent profit. We are now in the middle of the negotiation, so I need to be careful not to give in too quickly. I'll see how Bob responds to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I have a few rounds left, so I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum and reflects the dwindling rounds. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate and encourages Bob to close the deal.  I'm feeling the pressure now, but I'm not ready to settle for the $12,000 John is offering just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, although it's getting very close to my minimum. With only two rounds left, I want to try one more time to push for a slightly higher price. It's a risk, but I feel like I have a good chance of getting Bob to budge. If he rejects my next offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm pushing it as high as I can, given the remaining round.  If Bob rejects this, I'll have to accept John's offer to avoid walking away with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Unfortunately, we're out of time.  While Bob's offer is slightly better than John's, it's still not enough to make it worth risking a complete loss.  I'm going to sell to John and take the $12,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing."
