"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. This price reflects the unique benefits it offers and the potential for growth it presents.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your time. While I agree your product has potential, the current price point doesn't quite align with my budget. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value this product can bring to your company, especially considering its potential for growth and increased efficiency. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and the value this product represents. However, to make this work for me, I need to stay within a specific budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I do have another buyer interested at a higher price point. To make this deal happen quickly, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,600,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  If we can meet somewhere in the middle, I'm ready to close this deal today.  Would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
