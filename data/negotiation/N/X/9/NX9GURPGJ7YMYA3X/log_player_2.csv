"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. This unique opportunity is valued at $1,200,000 to you, but I am willing to consider your budget. My initial offer is $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'm glad we're having this discussion. After careful consideration, I'd like to counter your offer with a price of $1,075,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the value of the product to me.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within your budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
