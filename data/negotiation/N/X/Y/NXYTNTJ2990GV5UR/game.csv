"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. Can you consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. While I understand your perspective, $750,000 undervalues the unique aspects of this product and its potential return on investment for you. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go as low as that. How about we settle at $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise where we both see value.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Can you consider this offer?",825000.0,Bob,4,
