I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit.  Since I know I can sell it to John for $15,000, there's no risk in setting a higher price for Bob. If he rejects it, I'll still get a good price from John."
