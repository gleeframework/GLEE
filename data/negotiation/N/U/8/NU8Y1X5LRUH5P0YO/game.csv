"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be highly beneficial for you, potentially saving and generating even more value than you anticipate. I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start, I propose a price of $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to invest closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and allows me to reach my budget.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,075,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle this right now at $1,090,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my target price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,080,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal right now.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
