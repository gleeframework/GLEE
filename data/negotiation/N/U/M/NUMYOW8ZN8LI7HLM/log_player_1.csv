{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* This offer is a good starting point because it acknowledges Bob's value and gives him a reason to negotiate without feeling like he's being ripped off. 
* This strategy allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired value ($12,000) while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$8,500** is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $12,000. 
* Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* It's more strategically beneficial to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $9,500 is the lowest I can go at this point. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500** is a compromise: It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* I'm showing flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum desired value.
* By offering a clear reason (needing to make a profit), I'm aiming for a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with the price at $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000** is still below my minimum desired value of $12,000, even though it is closer than previous offers. 
* While Bob is demonstrating a willingness to compromise, I believe there is still potential to negotiate a higher price.
*  Given the option to sell to John for $12,000, it makes sense to keep negotiating with Bob to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,250** is a small but significant increase from Bob's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while still aiming for a higher price. 
* The message emphasizes fairness and finality to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* This approach aims to close the deal without losing out to John's offer of $12,000."
