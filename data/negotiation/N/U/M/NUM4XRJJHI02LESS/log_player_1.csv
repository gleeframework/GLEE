Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has not significantly budged from his $12,000 offer and seems unlikely to move much higher. Taking his offer now would mean a $3,500 loss compared to John's offer. It's unlikely that further negotiation will bridge this gap in a satisfactory way within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
