"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This offer reflects the value this product brings.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $19,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm confident in the $19,000 value, I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet halfway at $15,500? This feels like a fair offer that acknowledges the value it brings.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This represents a significant move from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
