# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive move, but I still need to make a profit.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's time to walk away. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $910,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're serious about this product, this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's final offer of $910,000 is a good deal, especially considering she's already made concessions. It's still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's worth it to avoid the risk of her walking away or me having to pay the full $1,000,000 to John. I'm happy with this outcome."
