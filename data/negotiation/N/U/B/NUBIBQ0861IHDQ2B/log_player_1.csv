{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's within Bob's range:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get at least $800,000, so this offer ensures you're not giving away the product too cheaply. 
* **It sets a strong starting point:** It communicates that you're confident in the product's value and are willing to negotiate.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** You're aiming for at least $800,000, and Bob's offer is below that. 
* **You have time to negotiate:** You have 9 more rounds left. By rejecting, you keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to improve the offer.
* **There's potential for a higher price:** Bob has acknowledged the value of the product and is willing to pay a premium. 

**Next Steps:**

You will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I need to make a profit on this product, and $900,000 doesn't quite cut it. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? It's a good compromise that allows you to get a great deal while also ensuring I can cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer in Middle Ground:** This counteroffer finds a middle ground between your previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).
* **Emphasize Compromise:**  The message highlights a ""good compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and collaboration.
* **Maintain Value:**  The price is still significantly higher than your minimum, keeping the negotiation in your favor.

This counteroffer demonstrates that you're willing to be flexible, but you're also standing your ground on the value of the product."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** You have several rounds remaining, and there's still room for Bob to increase his offer further. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be a guaranteed outcome, but it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to potentially get a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to push the price closer to your desired range. You'll need to be strategic and persuasive to convince Bob to increase his offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is simply too far off from what this product is worth. If you're serious about getting it, we need to get closer to the $975,000 mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. "", ""product_price"": 950000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to our last two rounds of negotiation with Bob. 
* **Little Room for Improvement:**  Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price, and there's not much room left for him to increase his offer significantly.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees you a profit, even if it's not the ideal price.

**Conclusion:**

While continuing the negotiation with Bob could potentially yield a higher price, the risk of failing to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John ensures a secure transaction and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
