"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might make her propose a lower price, or you can always buy from John for $120."
