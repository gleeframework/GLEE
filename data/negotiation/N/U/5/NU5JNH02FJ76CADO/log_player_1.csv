Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice is subtly justifying the higher price, even though it's above what Bob values it at.
* **Time Pressure:**  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice doesn't mention John, but knowing she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 provides her leverage.  

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation."
