"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I think it's a fair deal and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  How about we settle at $9,500? That would be a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Alice,5,
