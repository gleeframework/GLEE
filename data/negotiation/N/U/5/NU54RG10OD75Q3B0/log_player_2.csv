"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I think it's a fair deal and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is higher than my maximum budget. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a better deal.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much Alice is willing to move on price.  Her response will guide my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to my budget, but she's still offering a price higher than what John is willing to sell for. There's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm looking for something closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  How about we settle at $9,500? That would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to her $10,500 but still below my maximum budget. This aims for a compromise.
* **Time Constraint:** We're nearing the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  Proposing a slightly more aggressive price increase might encourage Alice to settle sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my maximum budget.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I can buy the product for the same price from John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at the best possible price."
