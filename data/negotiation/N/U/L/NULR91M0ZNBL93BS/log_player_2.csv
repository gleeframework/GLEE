"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but  $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good price while staying within his budget. This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price, showing a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with a price of $135. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $135 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $120. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of staying under $130. He's demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to get the best possible price. This counteroffer shows a commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go back to my original offer of $130. I'll counter with a price of $132.50. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:** Alice has come down to $132.50, which is only $2.50 above Bob's ideal price.
* **Time is running out:** Bob has already used 4 rounds, and buying from John at $150 is becoming a more real possibility.
* **Small difference:**  $2.50 is a small enough difference that it might not be worth risking further negotiations.  

While Bob might still be able to push for a lower price, accepting the offer here minimizes the risk of not getting the product at all and ensures a good deal within his budget."
