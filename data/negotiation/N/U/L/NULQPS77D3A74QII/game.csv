"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $11,000?  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to make one more concession. Would you consider $10,750? This is a very fair price, considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal!",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,375?",10375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I want to make sure we find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. How about $10,562? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!",10562.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,562 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $10,200?",10200.0,Bob,8,
