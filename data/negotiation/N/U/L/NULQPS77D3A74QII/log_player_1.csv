"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and persuasive:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 
* **First offer:** I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.

**Important Note:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'm aiming for.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. He's shown interest and is willing to make a serious offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price. 

I'm choosing to keep negotiating with Bob in the hopes of getting a better price, but I'm always keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $11,000?  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining a reasonable margin:** $11,000 is still a good profit for me, but it also leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I want to keep the negotiation friendly and focused on finding a mutually agreeable solution.

**Strategy:**

* I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* I'm also emphasizing the importance of finding a solution that works for both of us, making Bob feel valued and part of the decision-making process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still below my minimum. 
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:** Bob's willingness to meet halfway shows he's genuinely interested in acquiring the product. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I can leverage John's offer of $15,000 to push Bob towards a more favorable price.

**Strategy:**

* I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm aware of my fallback option with John, which gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to make one more concession. Would you consider $10,750? This is a very fair price, considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasizing value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Urgency:** I create a sense of urgency by suggesting this is my final offer, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to meet my final offer.
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to either accept John's offer or make a final counteroffer to Bob,  keeping in mind that I have a limited number of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,375? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds:**  We are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and time is becoming a factor. 
* **John's offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind, as it provides a safety net and bargaining power.

**Strategy:**

* I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I will need to be more assertive in my counteroffers to ensure I get closer to my desired price point.
* I'll be more mindful of the remaining rounds and prepare to potentially switch to John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I want to make sure we find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. How about $10,562? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10562}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This is my final concession, showing flexibility while still remaining above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I reiterate the importance of finding a mutually acceptable solution to make Bob feel heard.
* **Urgency and closure:** I emphasize the need for closure to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal.

**Strategy:**

* I'm using this counteroffer to test Bob's commitment. If he's serious about acquiring the product, he should be willing to accept this offer.
* I'm getting closer to my minimum and am prepared to either accept Bob's offer or switch to John's offer in the next round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,562 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $10,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only two rounds left, there isn't enough time to significantly increase Bob's offer.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer of $15,000 guarantees me my minimum, which is crucial since I've already made several concessions.

**Strategy:**

*  I'm choosing to prioritize my minimum profit and accept John's offer, as the remaining rounds are unlikely to yield a significantly better deal with Bob."
