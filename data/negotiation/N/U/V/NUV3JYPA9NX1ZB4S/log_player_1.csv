Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, as it's well below the market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired value than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the good deal Bob is getting by emphasizing that the price is below market value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $14,000 price gives me a $1,000 cushion in case Bob counteroffers.
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I don't want to go too low in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, I would like to counter with an offer of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, it's still $2,000 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I have room to counter with a higher offer and potentially get a price closer to my desired value. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which I believe is fair for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $13,500 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize that this price is ""fair for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm not losing out if Bob rejects this offer. 
* **Keeping the negotiation moving:**  I'm keeping the negotiation going to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,200 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even with Bob's latest offer of $13,200, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** I've already compromised twice, and further negotiation is likely to result in a price I'm not comfortable with.
* **John's offer guarantees my minimum:** Selling to John for $15,000 ensures that I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiations. 

While I'm aiming for the best possible price, I need to be realistic and ensure that I'm not losing out on a sure thing by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
