Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your potential in maximizing its benefits."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a strong offer aims to get as much profit as possible from Bob, who values the product significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing you well above your alternative deal. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly reminding Bob why he's willing to pay a premium. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an unreasonably low offer from Bob."
