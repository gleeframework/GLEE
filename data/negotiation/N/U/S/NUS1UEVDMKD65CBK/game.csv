,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $135? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.50. Can you consider that?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $132.50 is still a little too low. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, how about $134? It's a fair price for a product of this quality. Let's make this deal happen!",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $133, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",133.0,Bob,6,
