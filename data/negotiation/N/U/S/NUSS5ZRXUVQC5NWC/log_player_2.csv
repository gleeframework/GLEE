"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $115 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $107.50?"",
""product_price"": 107.50
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $111.25. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While it might be tempting to try and negotiate further, getting the price down to $111.25 is a good deal and significantly less than John's offer. It's better to accept now and secure the savings rather than risk the negotiation going sour in later rounds."
