Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value, and I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you, and we can finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $14,000 is still a bit low. How about $15,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
