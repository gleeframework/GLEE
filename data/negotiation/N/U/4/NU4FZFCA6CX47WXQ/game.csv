"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you, and we can finalize the deal quickly.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $14,000 is still a bit low. How about $15,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $15,500 is very close to what I'm willing to spend.  Would you accept $14,500?  That's my final offer.",14500.0,Bob,6,
