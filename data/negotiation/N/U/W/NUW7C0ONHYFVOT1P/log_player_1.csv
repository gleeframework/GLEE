"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but I'm aiming to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. 

This first round is about establishing a starting point and seeing if Bob is willing to play ball. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I believe we can get closer to my desired price. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000.  This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $925,000 is getting closer, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push for a higher figure. I'm also keeping in mind that John is a potential buyer, and selling to him would guarantee $1,000,000, which is significantly closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,050,000. I'm now within $25,000 of John's offer, so the stakes are getting higher.  I need to figure out if Bob is willing to go that extra distance or if I should just cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. While I would have liked to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offers are consistently lower than John's.  We've reached a point where the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential gain.  Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, which is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable value and a more secure outcome."
