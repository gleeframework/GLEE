Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower than that with Bob allows us to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $950,000 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity.  The mention of ""other interested parties"" subtly reinforces this.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a firm offer, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, giving us a chance to potentially meet in the middle for an even higher return."
