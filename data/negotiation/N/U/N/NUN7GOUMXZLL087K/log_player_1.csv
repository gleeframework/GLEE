Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $100, so aiming high initially makes sense.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to haggle, but still ensures a good profit for you.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price."
