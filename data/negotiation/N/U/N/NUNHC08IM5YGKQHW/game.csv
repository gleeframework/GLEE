"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,200 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,800.  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,800 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
