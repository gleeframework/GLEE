"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,500,000 to me. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. Considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This offer is closer to my budget, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value to me. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
