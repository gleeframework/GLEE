Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you. 
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with your backup plan (John).

**Strategy**

The optimal strategy is to aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer before I explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're confident and highlight the ""exclusive opportunity.""
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your hand, you imply the product's value justifies the price.
* **Urgency & Scarcity:** The ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""other options"" add pressure without being overly aggressive.
* **Price Point:** $1,350,000 gives you a significant profit over your minimum while leaving Bob with a potential $150,000 gain compared to his valuation.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  Negotiation is dynamic, and you could adjust your strategy based on Bob's personality and your understanding of his negotiation style."
