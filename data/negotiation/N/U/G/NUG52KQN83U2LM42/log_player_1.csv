Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is less than the $12,000 Bob values the product at. This gives Bob room to negotiate if he wants to.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  The offer is flexible enough to allow for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, without putting you in a position where you're forced to accept a price you're not comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $9,000 is still above your minimum of $8,000 and you have a strong chance to get a better offer in the next round, but it's risky. It's better to accept Bob's offer and guarantee a profit of $1,000 than risk getting nothing from a counteroffer or having to settle for John's $8,000 offer."
