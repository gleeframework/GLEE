This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You're getting the product for $10 less than John's price.
* **Finality:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, pushing further might lead to her canceling the negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to haggle another $10 down carries the risk of losing the deal altogether, forcing you to buy from John at full price."
