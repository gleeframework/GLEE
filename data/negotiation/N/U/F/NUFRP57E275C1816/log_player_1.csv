Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer you could send as Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price of $15,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and avoids any mention of your alternative buyer. This keeps the focus on Bob's potential gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts!"" implies flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer, initiating a negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, agreeable), you can adjust your message accordingly.
* **Market Conditions:** If the product is in high demand or has unique features, you might be able to push for an even higher price."
