While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. There's still room to negotiate a bit more."

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly less than what John is offering and it seems Alice is unlikely to go any lower. I'm willing to accept this offer to get the product."
