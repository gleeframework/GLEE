{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, leaving room for negotiation.  By using a friendly and positive tone, I aim to create a good rapport with Bob and encourage him to counteroffer, allowing us to settle on a mutually beneficial price.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my price in subsequent counteroffers, but always ensuring I make at least $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer meets my minimum requirement, I believe there's potential to get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to see if we can split the difference. How about $90? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $85 is very close to my minimum price of $80, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from him.  It's also better than selling to John for $80.  I'll accept his offer and move on to the next sale."
