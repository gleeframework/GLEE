"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  I'd be willing to go up to $95, but that's really all I can do.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $95, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $102? It's still a good deal, and I think you'll really like the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
