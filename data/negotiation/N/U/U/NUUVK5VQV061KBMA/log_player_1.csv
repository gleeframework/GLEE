Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, it's always best to aim for the highest possible profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000, so we need to start above that.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $950,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, but there's also a chance he'll accept it, netting you a higher profit than John's guaranteed offer."
