You should accept Alice's offer.  $925,000 is a good price, and you're getting closer to your maximum.  You could potentially try to negotiate further, but there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll have to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to take this offer and secure the product."
