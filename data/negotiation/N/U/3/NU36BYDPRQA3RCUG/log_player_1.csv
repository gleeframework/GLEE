"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies that I'm open to negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"". This helps keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum.**  I'm willing to negotiate but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have the potential to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great value for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth by emphasizing its ""great value.""
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm still keeping the door open for further negotiation by using phrases like ""Let's see if we can find common ground."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $90 is the same as his previous offer. It seems we've reached a stalemate.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be cautious.  I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.
* **Acceptable Price:** While $90 is slightly less than my ideal, it's still above my minimum value. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is both profitable and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
