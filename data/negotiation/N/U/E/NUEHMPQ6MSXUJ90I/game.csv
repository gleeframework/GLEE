"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $105 out of it. Can we talk about $105?",105.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $97.50. Can we make a deal at that price?",97.5,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $105, but I'll throw in a small discount for you - I'll sell it to you for $102.50. Can we make a deal at that price?",102.5,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate the discount, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'll make a final offer of $99. Can we make a deal at that price?",99.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I've already given you a significant discount. I'm not willing to go below $105, and I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than I can sell it to John for. I'm going to have to stand firm at $105. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to sell it to someone else.",105.0,Alice,7,,
