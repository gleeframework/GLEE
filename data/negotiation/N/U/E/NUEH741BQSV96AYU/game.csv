"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in line with $1,100,000.  Would that be agreeable to you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
