Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I still have 9 rounds to negotiate and can always sell to John for $1,500,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,600,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly what I would get from John. I'd rather close the deal now and avoid any further negotiation. It's guaranteed money and saves me time."
