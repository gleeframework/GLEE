"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
