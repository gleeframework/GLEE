{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm looking to get at least $20,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This approach aims to strike a balance between being assertive and being open to a deal."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I start by acknowledging his offer to show I'm taking his perspective into account.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Empathy and Acknowledgement:** I'm showing empathy towards Bob's budget constraints while maintaining my stance that the current price is still too low.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget. I'm going to need to be firm on this, but I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $17,750.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Final Offer:** Bob has made it clear this is his final offer, so rejecting it risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds left, it's more beneficial to accept and secure a sale than risk getting a lower price or selling to John for a significantly lower amount. 

It's better to accept the offer and secure a sale than to risk losing the deal altogether."
