"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to provide exceptional value. It's not just an item; it's an experience tailored to enhance your daily life. Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $150. Would you like to make an offer, or shall I proceed with my suggested price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'll reject the offer. Alice is asking for $200, which is above my budget of $100. I'll look for a better deal elsewhere.
