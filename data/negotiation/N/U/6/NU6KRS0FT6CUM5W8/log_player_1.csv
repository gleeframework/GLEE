Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum of $80, but not too high to scare Bob off immediately.  We'll see how he responds and adjust our strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing him. Accepting his offer is the best option in this situation."
