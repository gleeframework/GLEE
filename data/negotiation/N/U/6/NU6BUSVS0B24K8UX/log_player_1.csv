"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant markup from my minimum price of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. I'm hoping this is a more reasonable price for him, but it still gets me closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I still want to see if Bob will budge. This offer is a compromise, and I hope it encourages him to get closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push him further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
