"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above the maximum price Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000. This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a lower price, leaving room for potential compromise.  It's a significant discount from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about wanting to make a deal but also setting a firm limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  Buying from John at this point would mean paying the maximum amount, and there's still a chance to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's previous counteroffer of $1,100,000 was rejected. This time, he's increasing the offer slightly to $1,150,000. This shows willingness to negotiate but also signals that he's not willing to go much higher. It's a compromise, trying to find a middle ground while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000. While it's getting closer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to keep trying to secure a better price. If he were to buy from John now, he would be paying more than he wants to. There are still a few rounds left to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price, but still wants to save as much as possible. This counteroffer is a small increase from the previous round, signaling a willingness to compromise but also setting a clear limit. It leaves room for Alice to make a small concession while still allowing Bob to potentially get a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.  This is a good deal, as Bob is getting the product at his desired price.  There's no reason to risk rejecting the offer and potentially ending up with a worse deal, especially since buying from John would cost the same.  Accepting the offer is the best course of action."
