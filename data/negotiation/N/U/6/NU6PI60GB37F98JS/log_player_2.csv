Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and has come down significantly from her initial offer. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is becoming smaller and there's a risk Alice will become less flexible. Accepting the $715,000 offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of having to pay John's higher price."
