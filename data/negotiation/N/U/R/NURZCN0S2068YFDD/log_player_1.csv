Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  I'm asking for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't sell for less than your minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:**  A high initial offer lets you gauge Bob's eagerness. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone even higher. If he negotiates, you have a buffer to work with.
* **Value Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the higher price.  

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price."
