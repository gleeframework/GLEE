I'm offering Bob the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed price of $800,000 from John. 

My reasoning is that:

* **Potential for higher profit:** If Bob values the product higher than $1 million, he's likely to accept the offer, giving me a bigger profit.
* **Worst-case scenario:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $800,000, which is a safe fallback option.

By offering a higher price, I'm maximizing my chances of securing a better deal while still having a guaranteed floor price."
