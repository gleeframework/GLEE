"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds immense value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering at $1,150,000, I'm leaving a significant margin between my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). 
* **Professionalism and Openness:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting further discussion, which is key to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still below my target price. I believe there's room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer signals that I'm looking for a better deal and keeps the door open for further discussion. I'm willing to risk a counteroffer to see if I can secure a higher price closer to $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've given your offer serious consideration.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,125,000, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above my minimum. This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying my price point without being overly aggressive.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage continued negotiation and a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. We're still in the early-to-middle stages of the negotiation, and I want to test his resolve. There's a chance he might be willing to go a bit higher, especially if I hold firm and present a compelling counteroffer. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure at least $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect that. Let's find a point we can both agree on. How about $1,110,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure it feels like a win-win."", 
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($15,000 down from $1,125,000), signaling that I'm getting closer to my bottom line. 
* **Focus on Value and Win-Win:** I'm reiterating the product's value and framing the negotiation as a collaborative effort to find a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help me gauge Bob's flexibility and determine if he's willing to move closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has dropped significantly, and he seems to be stuck on increments of $25,000. This suggests he may not be willing to go much higher.  At this point, the potential gain from continuing the negotiation with Bob ($50,000) is outweighed by the risk of him walking away entirely. 

Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the safer option. It guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
