{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what Bob is willing to pay, hoping to get a deal close to my minimum value. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? That's still a great price for the product, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer.  I'm emphasizing that $85 is still a fair price and hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $80 is still below my minimum, it's very close, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and ending up with nothing.  $80 is a fair price, considering the negotiation process and Bob's willingness to compromise."
