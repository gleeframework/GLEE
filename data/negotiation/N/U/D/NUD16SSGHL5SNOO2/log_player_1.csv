Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from John or no offer at all."
