I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still below it.  I've already spent several rounds negotiating with Bob and haven't been able to secure a price I'm happy with.  It's better to take the guaranteed $80 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
