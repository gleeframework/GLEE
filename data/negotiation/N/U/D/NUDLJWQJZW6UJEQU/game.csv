I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. How about $100? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $120.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $120, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $120. How about we try $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm happy to see we're getting closer, but $130 is still a little too high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal at $125. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.",125.0,Bob,6,
