"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. $10,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line.  To be fair, I could come down to $19,000.  This product has a lot of hidden value that you'll discover once you start using it.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $19,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  I think this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm expecting to get from the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but there's still a pretty big gap between our positions. Let's try to find a middle ground - would you consider $16,500?  I'm really trying to make this work.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $16,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",13000.0,Bob,6,
