Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **John's Offer:** $1,000,000 (your safety net)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, and you know Bob values the product more than you do. This puts you in a strong negotiating position. However, you don't want to price Bob out entirely. Aiming for a price slightly below his maximum gives you the best chance of securing the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why this Offer?**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, a strong incentive to accept. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a strong offer, you anchor the negotiation higher. Even if Bob tries to negotiate down, you're starting from a point where you're likely to secure a great deal.
* **Alternative in Play:**  While you don't explicitly mention John, the fact that you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives you leverage.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He may counter-offer, but you know your walk-away point."
