"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is a bit outside my budget at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe the product would be valuable to my business.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $700,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling the product. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is a compromise that takes into account the value you've expressed for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Alice,5,
