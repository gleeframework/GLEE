Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is a compromise that takes into account the value you've expressed for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees the purchase within Bob's budget."
