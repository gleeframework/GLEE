"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,800,000 represents my ideal price point, I'm willing to move closer to your number to find a compromise. Would you consider $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,525,000?  This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve a positive outcome.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
