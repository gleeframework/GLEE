{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without going over. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The offer of $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Backup Offer:** Alice has a backup offer of $8,000 from John, so she's not desperate.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
