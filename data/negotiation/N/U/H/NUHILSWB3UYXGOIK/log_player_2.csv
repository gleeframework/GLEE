Alice's offer is a good deal, but you can potentially get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and consider other options. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in an attempt to secure the sale. Even if Alice doesn't budge, you're still guaranteed a price of $12,000 from John, which is within your budget."
