Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product but can only go up to $800,000 at this time. This reflects the value I place on it given my specific needs.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering the value I'm seeking and the limited time we have left. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is anchored firmly at $800,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly. It's clear that continuing negotiations with him risks leaving money on the table. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids further haggling."
