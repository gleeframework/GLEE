Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob.  This information is very valuable in setting your initial offer.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $19,000 allows room for negotiation. While it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who is willing to pay $15,000. This ensures you won't have to sell below your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob might try to negotiate the price down. Be prepared to counter-offer but don't go below your $15,000 threshold.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have an alternative buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is beneficial for potential future deals."
