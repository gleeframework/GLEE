"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $12,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to secure a good deal while staying within his budget.  Offering $12,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $13,500? It's still a fantastic value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is still a good deal for Bob, he's trying to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. Let's split the difference. $13,000 is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that benefits him. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids reaching a stalemate."
