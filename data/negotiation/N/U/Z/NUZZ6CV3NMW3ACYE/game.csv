"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is far below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. How about we settle at $1,125,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal here.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
