"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
