"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but unfortunately, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it,  which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my target price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $11,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can offer you a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but so do I. I can't go higher than $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us - it's within my budget and still allows you to make a profit.  Let's close this deal before we run out of time.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I've been thinking, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $12,000. I know we've been negotiating for a while, and I think we've found a good middle ground. I'm willing to accept your offer of $12,000. Let's finalize the deal!",12000.0,Alice,7,
