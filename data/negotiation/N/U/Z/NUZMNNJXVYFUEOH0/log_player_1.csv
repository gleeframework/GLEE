"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price, as I want to maximize my potential profit.  I believe this initial offer is aggressive enough to gauge Bob's interest and encourage negotiation, but not so high that it immediately scares him off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal. I have several more rounds to work with, and I'm confident I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, but it's still within my acceptable range.  I believe this price is high enough to incentivize Bob to continue negotiating, while also showing that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I can get a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum value and avoids any potential risk of a lower offer in future rounds."
