Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's offer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,000 is a good deal and higher than what John is offering. It's worth closing the deal now and avoiding any further negotiation."
