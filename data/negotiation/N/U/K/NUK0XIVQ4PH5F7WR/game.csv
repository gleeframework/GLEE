"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $160 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price down, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $142. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",142.0,Alice,5,
