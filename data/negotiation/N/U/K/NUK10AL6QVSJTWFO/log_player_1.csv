"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, but still below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness Justification:**  I'm framing the offer as fair, referencing Bob's perceived value. This helps build goodwill and sets a positive tone. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion and willing to work towards a mutually agreeable price. 

**Note:** This is just the first round.  My next offer will depend on Bob's response and the remaining rounds.  I'll be keeping John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, I am not comfortable with $950,000. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $700,000? I understand this might be below what you're hoping for, but I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's also far below my initial offer of $950,000, which indicates he's not serious about a fair deal. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $800,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, and hopefully, motivates Bob to come closer to my valuation. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that's closer to $800,000, while keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value to you.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a win.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:** I'm maintaining my minimum price point of $800,000 by offering $850,000. This shows Bob that I am serious about getting a fair price.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, implying that he's getting a good deal at $850,000.
* **Compromise language:**  I'm framing this as a compromise to encourage Bob to see the offer as a reasonable middle ground.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm still leaving the door open for further discussion to find a mutually acceptable price.

I'll observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round. I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I think $800,000 would be a fair price. It's slightly higher than my initial suggestion but still within my budget. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 perfectly matches my minimum acceptable price.  I can't expect to get more, especially since John is also willing to pay this amount.
* **Time constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's strategically advantageous to secure this deal.  Further negotiation might risk losing both Bob and John.
* **Fair compromise:** While I'd prefer a higher price, $800,000 is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I can close the deal quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation, which might lead to a lower price or no deal at all."
