"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always adjust my price down in subsequent rounds.  It's also important to note that I'm willing to walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $14,000 is still a good price, but I believe I can do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise that is still slightly higher than Bob's offer, but shows my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price without pushing him away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still hopeful that I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. We're still in the early rounds, and I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000.  This is closer to Bob's offer but still a bit higher.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway and close the deal.  However, if Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John for $10,000.  We're getting close to the middle of the negotiations, and I don't want to waste too much time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not convinced that Bob won't budge any further.  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and I believe there's still room for a better deal.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round, but if Bob rejects that, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still maintains some of my desired value. I'm hoping that this show of willingness to negotiate will finally push Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round, as we're getting close to the end of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to sell to John.  Bob has shown a consistent unwillingness to budge on his offers, and it's clear that I won't be able to get closer to my desired price.  While $12,500 is better than my minimum, selling to John for $10,000 ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
