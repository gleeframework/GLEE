"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $900000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your desire to get the best deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $875000 still isn't quite there for me. Let's try $890000. This is a fair compromise that keeps the deal beneficial for both of us. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $880000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",880000.0,Bob,6,
