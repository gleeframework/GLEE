Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than you're willing to settle. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value your product highly.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $22,000, I'm setting a high anchor point.  Even if Bob rejects this price, his counteroffer is likely to be higher than if I started at a lower price. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer helps me gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will provide valuable information for the next stage of the negotiation.

I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I also have John as a backup option, ensuring I don't settle for anything less than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but I believe I can't afford such a high price. Would you consider reducing it to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation open and move towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is considerably higher than your offer.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:**  I've significantly lowered my price from $22,000 to $16,000, showing flexibility. Importantly, this keeps me well above my $15,000 minimum and John's offer.
* **""Meeting Halfway"" Framing:** This phrasing encourages a sense of compromise and fairness, even though it's not a mathematically precise split of the difference.
* **Testing Bob's Seriousness:**  This counteroffer will reveal how serious Bob is about purchasing the product. If he's unwilling to move significantly from $10,000, it may be time to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we perhaps agree on $14,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Approaching My Limit:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting close to my $15,000 minimum and John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significant increase in price. He's already shown his hand, and my leverage is decreasing.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price without the risk of further negotiation or Bob backing out. 

While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of losing both offers. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
