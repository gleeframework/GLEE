"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. Our initial offer is $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000, and it's clear there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers.** This gives Bob a chance to get a better price and potentially save a significant amount of money. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  This option is only worth considering if negotiations with Alice fail completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still a bit far apart. Our revised offer is $850,000 for the product. We're willing to meet you halfway between your offer and our initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price range.
* **Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate.**  There's still potential to find a middle ground and save more money.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** It's important to exhaust all negotiation options with Alice before resorting to this option."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference between our last offers: I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're not quite ready to settle at $800,000. Our revised offer is $825,000 for the product. We believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but still too high.** It's just $25,000 below Bob's ideal price, and there's still potential to negotiate further. 
* **There's still time to negotiate.**  Bob has 5 rounds left, so there's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's still above his target price.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  While it's getting closer to being a viable option, it's still significantly more expensive than what Bob is hoping to pay."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close to a deal. Let's meet in the middle at $812,500. This would allow us both to walk away happy.

* **There's still potential to negotiate further.** Bob has 3 rounds left, so there's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's still above his target price.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  It's becoming more tempting as the negotiations with Alice drag on, but it's still significantly more expensive than what Bob is hoping to pay."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to offer $815,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations. I believe this is a price we can both agree on to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 815000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $817,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target.**  It's only $7,500 above his ideal price of $810,000.
* **There's only one round left.**  This is the last chance to negotiate with Alice, and it's getting close to the point where buying from John becomes a more appealing option.
* **Accepting the offer saves Bob a significant amount of money** compared to buying from John. 

While Bob could try to counteroffer one more time, it's unlikely Alice will budge further, and it could risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting the current offer secures the product at a price that's close to his desired range, making it the most financially sensible choice."
