"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think it's a great value, considering its worth to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $18000 is a bit steep for me. I really appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for the product.  It's the highest I can go right now.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $14000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price that's even closer to your offer. How about $13500? It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a deal that works for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. However, $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can both be happy with it.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12500 is a serious offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value of $15000. How about $13750? It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a deal that works for both of us. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
