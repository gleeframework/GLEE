"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1800000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can we meet at this price?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1600000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1700000, which is a good compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a final offer of $1650000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
