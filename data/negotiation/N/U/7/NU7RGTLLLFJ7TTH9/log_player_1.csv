Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below this at $14,500 gives her a strong chance to maximize her profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the message is firm, it hints at potential flexibility (""open to discussing...""). This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price that's still very favorable for Alice.
* **Time Value and Certainty:** Accepting a slightly lower price from Bob provides immediate profit and avoids the uncertainty of dealing with another buyer, even if John is guaranteed to pay $15,000. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject $14,500. However, the potential reward of securing a near-maximum price outweighs the risk of losing the sale to Bob in this scenario."
