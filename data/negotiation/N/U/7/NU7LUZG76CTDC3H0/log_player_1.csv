Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit high for me at this moment.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while still allowing you a good profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
