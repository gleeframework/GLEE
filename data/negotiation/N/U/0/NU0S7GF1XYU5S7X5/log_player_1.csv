"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,325,000, which would be $1,162,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,162,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently trying to halve the difference between your offers. While his offer is getting closer to a million, we still have room to negotiate and he's shown a willingness to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,243,750? This keeps us moving forward and gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 1243750
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're continuing to edge closer to our minimum while still making concessions that demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. This price splits the difference between the last two offers.  We're also starting to use language that encourages a deal without seeming desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway from $1,243,750, which would be $1,121,875. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,121,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,121,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to our absolute minimum, his consistent halving strategy suggests we might be able to push him a little further. We are still above our fallback option and have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  How about we settle this right now at $1,182,812.50? This represents a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1182812.50
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firm but Fair:** We're shifting our language slightly to convey a sense of firmness while still being open to a deal. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We're offering a smaller concession than Bob is used to, signaling that we're reaching the limit of our flexibility. 
* **Odd Number:** The very specific price might make it seem like we've put a lot of thought into this final offer and adds a touch of seriousness.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're starting to introduce a slight element of time pressure, subtly suggesting that this might be our best offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not getting close enough to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,182,812.50, which would be $1,091,406.25. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,091,406.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,091,406.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's offer is now very close to our absolute minimum of $1,000,000.  Continuing to push him aggressively risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The potential gains from further negotiation are getting smaller and smaller. Accepting now secures a significant profit.
* **Bob's Concerns:** Bob is expressing concern about the lack of progress, suggesting he may be losing patience. 

While we might be able to squeeze out a little more, accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
