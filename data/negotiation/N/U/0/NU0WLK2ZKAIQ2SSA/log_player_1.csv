"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting at $1,200,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try to get closer to that number.  I'll see if I can get Bob to move closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000. How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do even better. How about $975,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for me considering the value of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation. If I can get Bob to agree to $1,000,000 or slightly more, it's worth it.  However, if this next round fails, I'll sell to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I meet my minimum goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 still doesn't quite work for me. It's a great product, and it's worth a lot to both of us. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm not willing to go all the way up to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I've already made several concessions and I'm not confident that further negotiation will lead to a better outcome.  It's better to secure the sale to John at $1,000,000 than risk a lower offer or potentially reach a stalemate with Bob."
