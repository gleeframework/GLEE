You are trying to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still more than your limit of $8,000.  It's best to try to negotiate with Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which I believe is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
