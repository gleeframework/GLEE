"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $100 is still more than your target of $80. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but I'm only able to pay $85 right now. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $85. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $92. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still above your target price of $80. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $88. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $95. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but you're now in a position where the price is getting too close to what John is offering.  Since you have a guaranteed deal with John at $80, it makes sense to go with that option rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
