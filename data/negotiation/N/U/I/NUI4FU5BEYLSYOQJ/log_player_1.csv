Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,550,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to see some more movement. I'll propose $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly set on a price in this range. Accepting his offer of $1,450,000 is a significant profit, and there's always the risk he walks away entirely if I push further."
