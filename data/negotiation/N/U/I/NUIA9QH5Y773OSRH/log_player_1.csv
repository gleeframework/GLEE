"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $135, which is slightly above Bob's value of $120 but still significantly less than my minimum price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I'd like to counter with an offer of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a better price:**  I still have time and rounds left to negotiate with Bob. I can try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a backup:** Having John as an alternative buyer gives me a safety net, but I'll try to negotiate with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but am making a counteroffer that's closer to his price. This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I remind Bob that even at $130, he's getting a good deal. This emphasizes the product's worth.
* **Staying above minimum:** $130 is still above my minimum price, keeping me in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with an offer of $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for improvement:** Bob has increased his offer, which indicates he's willing to negotiate further.
* **Potential for higher price:** I can try to push for a higher price, even if it means going to the next round.
* **John's offer is still a backup:** I can always sell to John for $150 if I can't reach a better agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  While I value your continued interest, $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $128.  This is a fair price considering the quality of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price to $128. This shows flexibility and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I remind Bob of the product's quality to justify my price.
* **Close to my minimum:** $128 is only $2 away from my minimum price, leaving very little room for further concessions.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my preferred price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $126 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $126 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's offer is more attractive:** John is offering $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Limited time:** We are halfway through the negotiation process, and I need to make a decision soon.

While I'm happy to negotiate with Bob, I'm also aware that John's offer is a much better deal for me. I need to weigh the potential of a slightly higher price from Bob against the certainty of a guaranteed $150 from John. In this round, I will reject Bob's offer and keep John's offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $126 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $127, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 127} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final counteroffer. This adds a sense of urgency and pressure to Bob.
* **Small concession:** I'm only reducing my price by $1. This shows that I'm still trying to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Alternative options:** I remind Bob that I have other options (selling to John) if we can't reach an agreement. This emphasizes my position and adds more pressure.

**Rationale:**

This round is critical. I'm getting close to my minimum price and time is running out.  By being firm and making a final offer, I'm hoping to push Bob to accept or risk losing the deal. The threat of selling to John is a strong motivator. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your last offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your efforts. I would like to counter with an offer of $126.50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 8, with only two rounds left.
* **John's offer is better:** John's offer of $150 is significantly higher than Bob's current offer of $126.50.
* **Minimal chance of improvement:**  Bob's counteroffer is only a small increase from his previous offer. It's unlikely he will significantly increase his offer further.

While I'm happy to negotiate, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high. It's better to accept John's offer now and secure a higher profit with certainty."
