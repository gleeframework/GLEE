"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $8000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $8200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product to me.",8200.0,Alice,5,
