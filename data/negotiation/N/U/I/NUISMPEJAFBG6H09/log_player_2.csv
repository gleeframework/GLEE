{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if necessary.  The offer is still within Bob's budget, leaving room for potential compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

{""product_price"": 14000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, there are still rounds left to negotiate.  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, and there's potential to get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob more leverage to push for a price closer to his desired $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a strong compromise. It's within Bob's budget and is a small step closer to Alice's offer.  By making a small counteroffer, Bob shows a genuine willingness to reach a deal.  Alice is likely to see this as a reasonable compromise and potentially accept it."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, there are still rounds left to negotiate.  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, and there's potential to get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob more leverage to push for a price closer to his desired $15,000.  The longer Bob holds out, the more likely Alice is to make a final offer close to Bob's maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his maximum budget, and this offer is a strong compromise. It shows a willingness to finalize the deal, and is close enough to Alice's last offer that it's likely she will accept. This is a gamble, as Bob is leaving very little room for further negotiation, but the risk is mitigated by the fact that he has the option to buy from John at $15,000 if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, as Alice's offer is very close to Bob's maximum budget. However, Bob has only one round left.  There's a high risk that Alice will reject another counteroffer, leaving Bob with no other options. Buying from John at $15,000 guarantees that Bob gets the product within his budget."
