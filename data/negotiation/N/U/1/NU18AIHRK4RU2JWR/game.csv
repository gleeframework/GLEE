"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still allows for a significant profit for you while ensuring I get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
