Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Aiming slightly below this at $1,400,000 maximizes your potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  While you have a guaranteed offer from John, starting high leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message implies the product's value without explicitly revealing your minimum. This makes it more likely Bob will accept your offer. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want a quick sale, you could offer a lower price to ensure Bob accepts."
