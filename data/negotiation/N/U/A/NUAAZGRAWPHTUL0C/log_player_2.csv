"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you money."
