"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves a decent profit margin for me while still being attractive to Bob, as he values it at $120. This should hopefully lead to a quick negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with a price of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $80 and leaves me with a decent profit. Accepting his offer is the best decision in this round."
