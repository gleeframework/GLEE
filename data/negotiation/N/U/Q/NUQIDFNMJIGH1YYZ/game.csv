"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price reflects a more accurate valuation while still acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,
