Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. It seems we're nearing a point of agreement.  To meet you halfway, I propose a final offer of $825,000.  This represents a significant reduction on my part and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, and you risk her settling at a price higher than John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the product from John at your target price."
