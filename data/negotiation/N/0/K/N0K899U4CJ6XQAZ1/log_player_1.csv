Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $13,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile to keep negotiating. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. This is a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum value and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
