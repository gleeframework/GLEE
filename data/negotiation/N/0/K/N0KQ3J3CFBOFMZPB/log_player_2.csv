"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $100
* **Your Maximum:** $80
* **John's Offer:** $80

While Alice's message tries to persuade you, you know you can get the product for $20 less from John. Rejecting her offer gets you closer to your goal of saving money."
