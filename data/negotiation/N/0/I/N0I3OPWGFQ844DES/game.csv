"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I was thinking that $1000000 is a bit too low considering the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1050000.

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1030000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1030000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to budge from my previous offer. I'm sticking with $1030000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer, and I'm not going any lower.",1030000.0,Alice,9,
