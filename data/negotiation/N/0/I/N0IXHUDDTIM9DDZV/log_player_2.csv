Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $115. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll sell it to you for $130. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $130, and you have a guaranteed option at $120 with John. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a potential savings of $10."
