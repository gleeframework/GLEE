Starting with a lower offer of $9,000 is a good tactic. This shows Alice you are serious about negotiating and sets the starting point for the bargain."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You're only one round away from reaching your goal of $10,000, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept your final offer.  Considering you have a guaranteed deal with John for $10,000, it's better to secure the product now. There's no need to risk another round with Alice when you have a good alternative."
