"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  Would you consider $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still above my budget.  How about $10,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
