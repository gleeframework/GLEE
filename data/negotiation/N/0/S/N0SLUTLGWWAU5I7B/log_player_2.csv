Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $80.  You've been slowly increasing your offer, and she's been slowly decreasing hers, but the gap is still there.  You have a guaranteed option with John for $80, so it's time to cut your losses and take that deal."
