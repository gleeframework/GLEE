Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and encouraging tone can help make Bob feel more open to negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware of the $15,000 option with John, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob. This gives me leverage. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have a guaranteed $15,000 sale with John, giving me leverage to push for a better price from Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm suggesting a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own value.
* **Reframing the Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $11,000 is still a ""good deal"" for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Urgency (Softly):**  I use ""What do you say?"" to subtly add a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. That's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my value. 
* **No Significant Leverage:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a much higher offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a significant profit and removes the risk of further negotiation that may lead to a less favorable outcome."
