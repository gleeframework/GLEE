Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to secure this product for a slightly lower price.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for it. This would still be a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your offer at $900,000. We believe the true value of this product is $1,000,000, reflecting its quality and unique features. I am willing to consider a compromise at $975,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is a good compromise and falls within Bob's budget of $1,000,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject another counteroffer, forcing Bob to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
