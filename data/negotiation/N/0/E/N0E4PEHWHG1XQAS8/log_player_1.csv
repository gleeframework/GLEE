"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it also leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can then see if he's willing to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $70 is far too low.  It's not even close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price to $120. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.  I hope this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get him to agree."
