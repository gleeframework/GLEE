Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in your product, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to consider purchasing it for $950,000. This price aligns more closely with my current financial capacity and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
