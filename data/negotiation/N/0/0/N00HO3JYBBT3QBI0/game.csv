"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $12000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11500. It's a fair price, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. How about we meet in the middle again at $11250? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for a product like this.",11250.0,Alice,5,
