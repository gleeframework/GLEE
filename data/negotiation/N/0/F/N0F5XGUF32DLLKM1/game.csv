"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? That would still give me some room to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $80.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.  If not, I'll have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
