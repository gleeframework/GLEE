Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open. It gives Bob a good starting point while still offering me the chance to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum ($80), I'm not ready to sell just yet.  Here's why:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and acknowledged its value.  There's a good chance we can reach a price closer to $100 with further negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** Rejecting his offer allows me to gauge how committed Bob is to buying. If he's truly interested, he might counter with a higher offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and increase my chances of securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product and understand your budget.  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a counter-price of $95, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility without significantly decreasing my potential profit.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns and reiterate the value of the product to him. The message aims to encourage him to accept the offer while maintaining a positive negotiation tone. 

By making a reasonable counteroffer, I hope to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? I'm really hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $80 and is within my acceptable profit margin.  Since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and seems determined to make a purchase, I'm confident that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.  

Therefore, accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a profit that exceeds my minimum goal."
