"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $100, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product and understand your budget.  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

You can still do better than $95, and it's worth trying to negotiate further to get closer to your target price."
