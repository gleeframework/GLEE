"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be even more valuable to you. My starting price is $950,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's too high for me.  I'm interested, but I need a lower price. How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply not enough. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Can we meet in the middle at $725,000? ",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. Let's compromise. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This still leaves a significant profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  I'm ready to close the deal now.",800000.0,Alice,5,
