Round 2
Bob's offer:

$600,000 is far too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob or John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. Let's compromise. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This still leaves a significant profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  I'm ready to close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 800000}
