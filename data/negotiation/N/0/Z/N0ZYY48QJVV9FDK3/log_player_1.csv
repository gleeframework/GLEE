Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate to sell. I'm going to try to get a better price by seeing if I can negotiate a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have room to maneuver."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This represents a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm willing to accept a little less than my initial offer, but I'm not going to settle for $11,000 yet. I'll see if I can get Bob to go a little higher. There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit off.  How about $11,500?  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. $11500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $11250. Let's see if we can find that common ground we talked about.
