Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit off.  How about $11500?  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:**  You're still willing to compromise, but moving the price up in smaller increments to try and reach a mutually agreeable point.
