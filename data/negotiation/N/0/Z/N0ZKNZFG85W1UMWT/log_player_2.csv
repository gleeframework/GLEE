"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $150. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $150. This is significantly higher than your limit, so it makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the deal, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than $150, it's still over your limit of $100.  You can try to negotiate further with Alice, as you're still getting closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit over my budget at $130. I'm really keen on this product, but $110 is the absolute most I can do. Let's see if we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is your absolute maximum, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $125 is still above your limit of $100. While you could continue negotiating, you've already reached a point where it might be better to just purchase the product from John at your desired price. Continuing the negotiation with Alice might risk her rejecting your next offer, potentially leading to a higher price or a stalemate. It's best to secure the product at your target price with John."
