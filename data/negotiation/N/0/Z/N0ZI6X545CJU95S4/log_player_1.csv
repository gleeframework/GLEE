Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value Bob will receive from the product, encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm happy to offer you the product for $9,500. This price reflects the value you'll get from it, while also allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum value of $10,000. It's also likely that further negotiation would be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale at a price that is more favorable than selling to John."
