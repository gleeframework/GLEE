"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $500,000? That feels more reasonable.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $750,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $750,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something closer to my initial offer.  Would you be open to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
