"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This is a serious offer and I'm confident it's fair considering the market value.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's exceptional value and leaves room for a win-win.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This offer acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I believe this deal makes sense for both of us. I'm willing to finalize at $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you're receiving.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
