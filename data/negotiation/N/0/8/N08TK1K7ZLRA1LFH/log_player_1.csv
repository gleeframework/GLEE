Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit above your $100 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can still adjust your price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to try to push for something closer to my initial offer.  Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
