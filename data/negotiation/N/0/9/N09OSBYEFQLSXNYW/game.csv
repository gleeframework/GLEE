"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is the lowest I can go. This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value this product offers. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
