"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is quite low, and going below $10,000 means I lose potential profit. I should try to negotiate a better price.
