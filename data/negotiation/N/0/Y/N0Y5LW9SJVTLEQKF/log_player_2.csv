"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my budget of $8,000. It's not even close to what I'm willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows me to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower offer than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget.  This sets a clear negotiation point and shows I'm serious about buying the product, while still pushing for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate but $8,500 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, it's still not a deal I'm willing to accept.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from $8,500 to $9,000. This is a significant step in the right direction, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. I'm still under my $8,000 budget, leaving room for potential negotiation in the next round."
