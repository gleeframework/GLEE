"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate but $8,500 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
