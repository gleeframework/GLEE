"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $13,500 for the product. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price, considering its value to you.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  That's still a good deal for you, considering your value for the product, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us moving towards a deal. Let's make this happen.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in the conversation. However, I need to make a bit more than $13,000 to justify the sale. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? It's still a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $13,250. That's a good compromise for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see we're really close now. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. How about we meet at $13,500? It's still a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,7,
