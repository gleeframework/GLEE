"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us to reach a fair agreement. Let's see if we can make this work.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product holds value for you, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $10,800? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your position, $10,800 still leaves me with less than my desired profit margin. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,150?  That's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",11150.0,Alice,5,
