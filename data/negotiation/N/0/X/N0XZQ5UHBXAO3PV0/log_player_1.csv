{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $13,000 is more than $12,000, giving Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $13,000 is still above your minimum of $15,000, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is not too high, allowing for potential counteroffers and a middle ground to be reached. 

By starting with this offer, you've set a strong foundation for a potential successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  

While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us to reach a fair agreement. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product holds value for you, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $10,800? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,800 is closer to my minimum, it still falls short of my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually agreeable price, but I won't accept an offer that leaves me with a significant loss. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
