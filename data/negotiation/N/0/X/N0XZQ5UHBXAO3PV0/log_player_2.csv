Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us to reach a fair agreement. Let's see if we can make this work.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your position, $10,800 still leaves me with less than my desired profit margin. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,150?  That's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,150.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference between her current offer ($11,150) and John's price ($12,000) is now relatively small. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation for a potential savings of $850."
