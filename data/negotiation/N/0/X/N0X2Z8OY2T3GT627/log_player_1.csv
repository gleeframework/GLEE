Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description, e.g., high-quality vintage guitar] that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:**  Starting with a price higher than your minimum value allows for negotiation space. It's important to note that the price should be realistic considering the product and market value. 
* **Message:**  A friendly and open message invites Bob to engage in the negotiation. Providing a description of the product helps him understand its potential value. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  See if he's serious about buying and potentially how much he values the product.
* **Start the negotiation:**  Set the initial price point and create a clear framework for discussions.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's acceptable. 
*  You can use John's $8,000 offer as a benchmark to decide if you should accept a counteroffer or make a new counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation stalls or you feel you won't get a better price, you can always fall back on John's offer to ensure you sell the product for at least your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly your minimum value.  While you might like to try to get more, it's risky to reject his offer and counteroffer. 

* **Risk of rejection:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept a higher counteroffer. He might walk away, leaving you with John's offer, which is the same.
* **Time factor:**  Negotiating further takes time and might not result in a higher price.

**By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale at your minimum value and avoid potential delays or complications.**"
