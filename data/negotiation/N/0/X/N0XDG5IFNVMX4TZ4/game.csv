"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing terms.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $900,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $950,000 is the most I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value significantly exceeds your current offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000, but that's my final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll propose $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
