"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done, but I can't go much lower than that.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,180,000 is closer, but I still need to be a bit higher to make this work.  How about we split the difference at $1,190,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this happen. ",1190000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,180,000. I'd also be willing to add an additional $10,000 to the deal, making it a total of $1,190,000. This is my final offer.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
