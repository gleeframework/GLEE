Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $10,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $7500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $8,000 to Alice, and Bob's offer is below that. It's better to keep negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $7,500 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000.  This price reflects the product's real value and allows for some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $8500, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and our negotiation history. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $8,500 is higher than John's offer of $8,000.  It's a good deal for Alice, and there's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
