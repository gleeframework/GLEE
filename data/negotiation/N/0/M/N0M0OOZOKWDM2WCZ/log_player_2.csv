# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1200000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. While I'm confident it's worth the price, I'm open to discussing a potential deal if you have any concerns. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Since your goal is to save money, and you know John will sell you the product for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option. You can then buy the product from John without losing any money."
