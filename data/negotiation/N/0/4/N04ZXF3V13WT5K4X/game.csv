"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget at $13500. Would you be willing to consider $12000, which is the price I've been offered by another seller? I'd really like to make a deal with you, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
