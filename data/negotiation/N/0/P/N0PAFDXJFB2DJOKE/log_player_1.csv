Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."

We're down to the last few rounds, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might not lead to a significantly better deal.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired value, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on that guaranteed amount."
