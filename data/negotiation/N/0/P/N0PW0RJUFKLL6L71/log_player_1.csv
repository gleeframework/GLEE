**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet anywhere near my minimum price. His increments are small, and it's unlikely he'll drastically change his offer in the remaining two rounds. Accepting his current offer would result in a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
