"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant benefit it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still below Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.** This means Bob is getting a better deal than going to John.
* **While Bob can try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price.**  $1,275,000 is a good compromise that saves Bob money compared to John's offer."
