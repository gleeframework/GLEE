"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant benefit it offers.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the value of this product.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
