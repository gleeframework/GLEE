"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a game-changer in its field and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $25000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $18000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to meet at least $14000 to break even. I'm counteroffering at $14500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to break even, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I hope it's enough to make this deal work for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",16000.0,Alice,7,
