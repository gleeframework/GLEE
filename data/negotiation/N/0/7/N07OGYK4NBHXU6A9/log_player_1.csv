"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $115?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I would like to counter with an offer of $105 for the product. This is my final offer within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if I can push him higher. I have 6 more rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $110.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to pay $107 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $107 is better than $105, it's still not a price I'm happy with, given my minimum acceptable price of $150. I have 4 more rounds to try and get closer to my target price. The product is worth $80 to Bob, so there is still potential for him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to be closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $112 for the product. This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $109 for the product. I hope this meets your needs while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, the negotiation isn't making significant progress. Bob's offers are still too low, and I'm running out of time to reach my desired price. Selling the product to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
