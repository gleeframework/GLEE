Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so this is your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high without being unreasonable. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might scare Bob away.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase the [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""confident it will exceed your expectations""  frames the product as high-value.
* **Fairness:**  By mentioning a ""fair deal"" and alluding to Bob's potential ROI, you're justifying the price.
* **Leaving Room:**  While your offer is strong, it leaves a $100,000 cushion for Bob to feel like he's getting a somewhat good deal. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could adjust the price slightly up or down based on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style or if you have additional information."
