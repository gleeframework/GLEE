Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value, knowing he might counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially securing a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not satisfied with it. I believe I can still get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a profit above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and it's close enough to my initial asking price that further negotiation is unlikely to be worth the effort."
