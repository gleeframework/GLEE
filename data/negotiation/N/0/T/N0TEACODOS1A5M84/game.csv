"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that 180 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try 140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to go to $120?  That's the absolute maximum I can pay.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 120 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet at 130? That's the lowest I can go.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $125.  That's my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with John's offer.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that 125 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you at 128, but that's as low as I can go.",128.0,Alice,7,
