"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  This is a unique item and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Alice's offer is $9,500, which is better than John's price. However, you can still do better.  Since Alice is likely willing to negotiate, rejecting her offer creates the opportunity for her to lower the price.  You can then counter-offer with a price closer to your desired range."
