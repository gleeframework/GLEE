Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your desired profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $150 provides a safety net. You can be a bit bolder with your initial offer to Bob."
