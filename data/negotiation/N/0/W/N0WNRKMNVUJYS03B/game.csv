"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $125? This is a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you - $115 is a good offer, and I'm getting closer to my price. Let's compromise just a bit more. How about $120? That way, we both get a good deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
