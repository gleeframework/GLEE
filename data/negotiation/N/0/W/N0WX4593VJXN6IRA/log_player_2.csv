"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is offering it for $950,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffers are possible:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is a good strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering $850,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum value ($800,000).
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down further. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  There's still some room for negotiation if Alice counters, allowing for a mutually agreeable price within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While slightly lower than her initial offer, $975,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** We're only in round 3, meaning there are still plenty of opportunities to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:** Accepting at this price would be a bad decision, as I'm not maximizing my savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm increasing my offer by $25,000, showing a willingness to negotiate but not giving in too easily.
* **Staying within my budget:**  $875,000 is still within my budget and a reasonable compromise from my previous offer.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to meet me halfway and potentially reach a deal in the next few rounds."

Round 5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While slowly decreasing, $990,000 is still above my desired price point. 
* **Significant negotiation room:**  We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and there's room for further price reductions. 
* **Avoiding a bad deal:**  Accepting at this price would mean paying more than necessary, so it's better to continue negotiating."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to the middle:** I'm raising my offer to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a good compromise. 
* **Showing a willingness to meet halfway:**  This offer indicates that I am serious about buying the product and willing to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, so it's time to start closing the deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice is coming down in price, $1,005,000 is still beyond my acceptable price range.
* **Limited time:** We are getting closer to the end of the negotiation (only 3 rounds left).  However, it's still worth trying to get a better deal. 
* **Potential for a good deal:** Alice has been showing a willingness to negotiate, so it's likely she'll continue to lower her price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** I'm pushing for a significant increase from my last offer, showing a willingness to bridge the gap and reach an agreement.
* **Final push:** With only two rounds remaining, this counteroffer is a strong attempt to get Alice to accept.
* **Risk vs. reward:** While risky, there's a chance Alice will accept this offer to avoid potentially getting a lower price in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** It's the final round of negotiations.
* **Unrealistic expectations:**  Alice's offer of $1,020,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay, and it's unlikely she'll drop to a more acceptable price. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  There's a high risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.

**Buying from John:**  While John's price is higher, it provides a guaranteed purchase. This ensures I get the product without the risk of continued negotiations falling apart."
