"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $85?  I'm very interested in this product.",85.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $95. I'm really keen on this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $105 is still a bit too high. How about we settle on $98? It's a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",98.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we try $110 again? I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.",110.0,Alice,7,,
