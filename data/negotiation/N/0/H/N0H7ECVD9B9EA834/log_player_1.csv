Bob's offer:

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable Price:**  $1,230,000 is a significant profit over your minimum and a good return overall.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's increases are getting smaller.  Continuing might only net a few thousand more, if that. 
* **Time Value & Risk:** The longer negotiations go, the higher the chance of impasse.  John's offer is a safe fallback, but taking $1,230,000 now is the less risky, more time-efficient option."
