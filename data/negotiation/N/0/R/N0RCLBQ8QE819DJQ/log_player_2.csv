# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the value you've mentioned the product holds for you.

You should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's a compromise that I think we can both agree on.
