"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While I see the value in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his maximum budget of $12,000.  Accepting the offer means saving $1,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving.  Further negotiation might save a bit more, but the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and leaving Bob with no option but to buy from John makes accepting the current offer the best choice."
