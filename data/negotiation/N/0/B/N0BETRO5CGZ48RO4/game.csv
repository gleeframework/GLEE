"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $10000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $12000?  That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it would still allow me to make a decent profit.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",11000.0,Bob,4,
