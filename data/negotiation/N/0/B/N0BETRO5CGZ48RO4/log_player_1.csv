{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to offers, but I'd like to start with $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also includes a friendly message to establish a rapport with Bob and make him feel comfortable discussing the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $10000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $12,000?  That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it would still allow me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point,  I've come down from $15,000 to $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price,  Bob's offer of $11,000 is pretty close.  It's significantly more than John's offer, and it seems like there's a good chance we'll reach a final agreement with further negotiations. So, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best choice now."
