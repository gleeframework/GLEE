"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $82. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it.",82.0,Alice,3,
