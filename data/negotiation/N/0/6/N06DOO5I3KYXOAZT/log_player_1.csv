{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm trying to build rapport with Bob to make him more likely to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's enough space between my offer and Bob's value to allow for a back and forth.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product at a decent price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a counteroffer, or cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even lower than Bob's own perceived value of $80.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation. There's a gap between his offer and my minimum, making a counteroffer worthwhile. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I can always choose to sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering above Bob's offer but below my minimum:**  My counteroffer of $100 is still higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Explaining the rationale:**  I'm providing Bob with a reason for my price to make it seem more reasonable. 
* **Open-ended question:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I will analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value, Alice, but I have a strict budget. How about $75? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Even though Bob claims it's his final offer, $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's also not even close to his own perceived value of $80.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:**  Bob has already rejected two of my offers, and his final offer is very low. It's unlikely that we can reach a mutually acceptable price through further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  Given the situation, selling the product to John for $150 is the most profitable choice. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will contact John and finalize the sale."
