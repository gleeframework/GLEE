"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept $1125000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering at $1175000. This is my final offer in this range.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to accept $1150000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1175000, but I'm not budging further. This is my final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to accept $1165000. I've been clear about my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1175000 again, but this time I'm not budging further. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1175000.0,Alice,9,
