{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's maximum perceived value ($119) increases the likelihood of a sale while still maximizing potential profit. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and getting a price closer to his maximum perceived value, rather than settling for the guaranteed $120 from John."
