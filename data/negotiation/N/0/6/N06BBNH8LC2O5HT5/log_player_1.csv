Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $100 is higher than the $80 Bob is willing to pay, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $100 is below your minimum of $120, so you still have room to go down if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable offer:**  It's not too aggressive and gives Bob a chance to see value in your product. 

If Bob rejects, you can then analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, reject it and counteroffer again, or move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher before giving up and selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this deal work.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly higher than Bob's offer:**  $95 is a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired price, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:**  It's still above my minimum of $120, meaning I'm not losing money on the deal.
* **Reasonably close to Bob's offer:** This keeps the negotiation going and prevents Bob from walking away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** $90 is only $10 away from my ideal price, and significantly closer to my minimum.
* **Risk of losing a sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away entirely. 
* **Value of time:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and might not lead to a better outcome.

While I'd prefer to sell for more, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's close to my target and prevents potential losses from a failed negotiation."
