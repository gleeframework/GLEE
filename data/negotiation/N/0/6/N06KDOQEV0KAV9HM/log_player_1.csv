Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000). This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for negotiation and get a good price.
* **Positive and Enthusiastic:**  The message is friendly and positive, aiming to build rapport and create a sense of value for Bob.
* **Confidence:**  I express confidence in the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message doesn't close the door to negotiation, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer if he wants.

**Important Notes:**

* **Unknown Value:** I don't know Bob's perception of the product's value, so this initial offer is a calculated guess.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum of $8,000.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John's offer of $8,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $8,000. Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for that amount, there's no reason to accept Bob's offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to a compromise. How about $8,500? It's still a great price for the value of this product, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and showing that I'm willing to compromise. This helps maintain a positive tone and avoid appearing stubborn.
* **Counter with a Justification:** I counter with a price that's higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. I justify this price by highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that it's still a good deal.
* **Room for Compromise:** I explicitly state that I'm open to further negotiation, leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer if needed. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Balancing Act:** I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping the negotiation moving forward. 
* **John as Safety Net:** I still have the option of selling to John for $8,000, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $6500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly lower than my minimum of $8,000, and even lower than his previous offer of $7,000.  I'm not willing to drop that low, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob; I'm better off taking John's offer and securing a sale at my minimum price."
