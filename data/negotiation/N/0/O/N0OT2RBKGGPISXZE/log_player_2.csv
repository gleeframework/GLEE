(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still too expensive. You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further bargaining while still staying within your budget."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has reverted back to her initial price. This likely means she's not willing to budge much further. It's worth taking a chance on a counteroffer since you still have several rounds left.  However, keep in mind that the time to consider ""BuyFromJhon"" is getting closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but she's also holding firm on her price. This counteroffer is a compromise, acknowledging her previous offer while also staying within your budget. It's likely to be a more appealing offer to Alice, increasing the chances of acceptance and closing the deal before needing to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering a higher price than her initial offer.  With only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. Buying from John for $120 guarantees you'll get the product while staying within your budget."
