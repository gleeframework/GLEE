{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know the value is $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** By setting the price at $14,000, I can still make a profit of $2,000, which is better than selling it to John for $15,000.
* **Increase the likelihood of Bob accepting:**  While the price is higher than Bob's estimated value, it's still a good deal for him and leaves room for negotiation if he's hesitant.

I'm confident this offer will work in my favor!"
