,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a price closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however,  $11,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be fair to the product's value. Could you meet me at $12,000? This feels like a solid compromise.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you've been great to negotiate with.  To be honest, $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could do $11,750, and I think that's a very fair offer.  Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Bob,6,
