Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the bidding at $120.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and his perceived value of the product.
* **Alternative Option:** You have the safety net of John who's willing to pay $80, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent offer, it's still below your initial ask and leaves some potential profit on the table. Bob's message indicates interest, so it's worth trying to negotiate a bit further before accepting or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair price for a product of this quality."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob you're willing to negotiate but also holds firm on a price significantly higher than his offer. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""quality"" of the product, you're subtly reinforcing its value.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price closer to your initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $95 is a solid profit above your minimum price of $80. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might alienate Bob or lead to protracted haggling with minimal gains. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting this offer brings in a good return and allows you to move on to other potential sales opportunities."
