{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.

Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win scenario:

* **Bob Profits:** Bob gets the product for $2,000 less than he values it.
* **You Profit:** You make a $2,000 profit above your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob an attractive price, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale."
