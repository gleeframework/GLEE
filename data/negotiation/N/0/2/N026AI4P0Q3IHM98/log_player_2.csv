Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a fair price for you, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far apart from that number. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering you a price of $1,050,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet here.
