"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's within your budget, you want to save as much money as possible. 
* **Counteroffering is worth trying:**  You have 10 rounds, so rejecting and making a counteroffer gives you room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is lower than Alice's price:**  This shows you're serious about buying but want a better deal.
* **Price is still above Alice's value:**  Offering $95 leaves some room for compromise and ensures Alice has an incentive to negotiate.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  With 9 rounds left, you have time to work towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's lower than the initial offer, $105 is still above your desired price point. 
* **More room for negotiation:** You have 8 rounds remaining, and you can likely push for a better price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback:**  You can always buy from John, but you want to exhaust all negotiation options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. 
* **Showing willingness to compromise:**  This demonstrates your commitment to reaching a deal while still aiming for a price closer to your target. 
* **Time is on your side:** With 7 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate further if necessary."
