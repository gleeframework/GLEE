Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $12,000 to me. It's a good deal to sell it to John for $12,000. However, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $10,500? This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows me to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter again in the next round. While I can sell to John for $12,000, I believe I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. It would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10200}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear that $9,500 is his final offer. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made a significant concession.  To avoid risking the deal falling through completely, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000. It's a guaranteed profit, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to budge further."
