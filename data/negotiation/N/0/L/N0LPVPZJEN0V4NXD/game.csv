"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
