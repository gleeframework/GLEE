"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,500? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a little too high.  I'm really hoping to stay under $13,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,750?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,750 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $13,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,900, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement at this price.",12900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $12,900. While it's closer, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $13,000. This price allows for a fair deal for both of us and reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",13000.0,Alice,7,
