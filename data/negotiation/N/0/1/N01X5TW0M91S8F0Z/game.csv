"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a quick sale.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $900,000? This allows both of us to make a profit and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's keep the negotiations moving forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $875,000? This should be a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer,  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again*  at $887,500. This is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal!",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but only if you can come down to $882,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",882500.0,Bob,6,
