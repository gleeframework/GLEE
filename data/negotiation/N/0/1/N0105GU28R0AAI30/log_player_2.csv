"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it is worth $12,000. We understand its significance to you, valued at $15,000, and aim to find a fair compromise. Please let us know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's better than John's price, you can likely negotiate a lower price.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussion, I would like to propose a revised offer of $10,500 for the product. This amount reflects a fair compromise between our respective valuations. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget while still providing a reasonable return for our product. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.**  $10,500 is less than your maximum of $15,000, making it a viable option.
* **It's a good compromise.**  You've managed to negotiate a price lower than Alice's initial offer, and it's likely you won't get a much better deal in the next round.
* **Risk of further negotiation.** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice becoming less willing to negotiate or even withdrawing the offer altogether.

At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product while saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
