Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting.  Here's why:

* **Profit:**  You'll earn $20 more than selling to John.
* **Attractiveness:**  Bob is still getting a good deal, saving $20 compared to what the product is worth to him. 
* **Risk:**  While there's always a chance Bob will reject, it's less likely than a higher offer."
