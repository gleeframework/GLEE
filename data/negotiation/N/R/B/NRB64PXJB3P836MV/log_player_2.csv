{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance you can get Alice to come down to a price you're comfortable with, or you can always fall back on buying from John."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget.  You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again.  It's possible you can reach a compromise that works for both of you, or you can always buy from John."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within your budget of $800,000.  While it's not the ideal price, you can save money by accepting and avoid the risk of further negotiations. If you reject, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price from Alice.  You're also risking that she will walk away from the deal."
