"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good deal for Bob. He can get the same product from John for $8,000.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
