"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the potential it holds, I propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for it.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it's still within a reasonable range. This approach aims to: 
    * Gauge Alice's flexibility. 
    * Move the negotiation closer to our desired price range.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed as a starting point for further discussion, not a take-it-or-leave-it deal. 

We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy in the next round accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $825,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $825,000 is still above your $800,000 maximum budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still seven rounds of negotiation left.  Alice's willingness to move on price suggests further negotiation could be fruitful.

Let's see if we can get Alice closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $750,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer holds firm around the $750,000 mark, reinforcing your budget constraints. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning your readiness to close the deal adds a bit of pressure and might encourage Alice to make a more significant move.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This price point gives you room to negotiate slightly upwards (towards your $800,000 maximum) if needed in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate, I am pleased to counter with an offer of $800,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Budget:** Alice has met your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* **No Need to Risk It:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice would go any lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely.  You can always buy from John at this price anyway. 

Congratulations! You've successfully negotiated a deal within your budget!"
