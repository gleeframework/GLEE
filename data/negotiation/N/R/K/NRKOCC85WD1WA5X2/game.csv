"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $800000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a decent profit while also giving you a good deal on the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900000? This would give you a good profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  $900000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to accept $950000.  This would ensure a reasonable profit for me, while still being a fair deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
