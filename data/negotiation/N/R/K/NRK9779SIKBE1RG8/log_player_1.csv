"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Strategy:**  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $100.**  While I'm open to negotiating, I won't sell it for less than what it's worth to me. 
* **I have 9 more rounds.** There's still opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, or to sell to John if needed. 
* **I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.**  I'll try to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. That gives you a good deal, and it's still fair for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum value of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob (""good deal"") and highlighting the fairness of the offer for both of us. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum value. This approach increases the likelihood of reaching a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $100.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me.
* **I still have 6 rounds left.**  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or sell to John if necessary.
* **I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.**  I'll try to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $92.50? It's a small step for me, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing my offer by a small amount ($2.50) to show flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Progress:** I'm emphasizing the progress made in the negotiation (""closer to a deal"") and reframing my counteroffer as a small step towards a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Minimum:** While I'm willing to lower my price, I'm still ensuring it remains above my minimum value of $100.
* **Time Pressure:**  With 5 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap to avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but $92.50 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference and go with $91.  It's a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $100.** I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me.
* **I have 4 rounds left.** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or sell to John if necessary. 
* **I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.** I'll try to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, but I need to be mindful of the time pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one, but I can't go lower than $91.50.  That's a small difference, and it allows us to close this deal without anyone having to compromise too much.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 91.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($92.50) and Bob's current offer ($91).  This shows a commitment to compromise.
* **Focus on Closing:**  I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal and avoid further negotiation.  ""Allows us to close this deal"" implies that we're nearing the end of the process. 
* **Minimal Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price, but only by a small amount ($0.50).  This keeps the deal above my minimum value of $100.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to find a solution quickly before selling to John becomes the better option."
