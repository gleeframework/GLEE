{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers tremendous value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values it at $12,000 is helpful, but not the deciding factor.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:** The key is John will buy it for $15,000. This means Alice is never in a position to lose money.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high price like $14,999 sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be more favorable than his $12,000 valuation.

**It's important to note:** This assumes Alice doesn't have significant time constraints or other reasons to accept a lower offer quickly."
