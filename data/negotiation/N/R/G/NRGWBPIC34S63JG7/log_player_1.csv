Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above my minimum:**  This ensures I'm getting at least what I value the product at.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate up to $50,000 before reaching his maximum.
* **It avoids a quick deal with John:** If I offered a price too close to $1,000,000, Bob might reject and I'd be forced to deal with John, missing out on potential profit. 

This offer allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without pushing Bob away. I'm confident I can get a price closer to $1,200,000, but I'm also prepared to accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price and what I know the product is worth to Bob. Accepting his offer would mean leaving a lot of potential profit on the table. 

I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer to $1,100,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm to a price that reflects the product's value and my desired profit. 

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm aiming to reach a deal that is fair to both of us. This counteroffer also keeps the negotiation moving forward, avoiding a potential stalemate or having to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. Accepting would mean leaving a lot of potential profit on the table. 

I'm going to reject his offer and counter again. At this point, I need to consider how much time and effort I'm willing to invest in this negotiation. If I counter again and Bob still rejects, I'll likely move to sell to John, as the risk of further negotiation is high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final counteroffer to Bob at $1,075,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Close to the Middle Ground:** This price is closer to the middle ground between my last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's current offer ($1,025,000).
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While this isn't my ideal price, it's still above John's offer and provides a reasonable profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer tests Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely move to sell to John.

This is my final attempt to secure a better price from Bob. If he rejects, I'll accept John's offer to avoid further negotiation and potential losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has shown that he's unwilling to meet my final counteroffer, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better price. While $1,025,000 is a decent amount, it's still a substantial loss compared to my initial goal.

Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's the most logical decision to minimize potential losses and ensure a quick, clean transaction."
