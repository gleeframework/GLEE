"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
