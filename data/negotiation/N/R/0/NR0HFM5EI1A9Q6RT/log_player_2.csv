**Reasoning:**

While we could try to squeeze a few more thousand out of Alice, she's clearly committed to this slow and steady approach to negotiation.  At $832,500, we're getting a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000 price. The potential savings from further haggling aren't worth the risk of her increasing her price or the deal falling through."
