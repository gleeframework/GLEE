"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that balances the value of the product with the potential profit for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price that reflects the value and allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let's reach a deal!",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
