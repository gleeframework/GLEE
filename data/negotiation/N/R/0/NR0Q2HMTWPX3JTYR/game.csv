"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $120 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $135.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",135.0,Bob,4,
