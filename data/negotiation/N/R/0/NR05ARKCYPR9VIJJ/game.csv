"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1500000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to accept this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to pay $1200000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1350000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness, and I think it's worth considering.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
