{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. This counteroffer is a strong opening move, offering a price that's still within Bob's budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It demonstrates Bob's serious intent to purchase the product while also putting pressure on Alice to negotiate."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still too high for Bob's target.  Continuing to reject the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his ideal. While John's offer is always an option, there's still room to save money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better deal. There are still several rounds left, and Bob can still potentially save more money by continuing to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John at this point would be a last resort, especially since the price difference between Alice's offer and John's is only $150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's last offer. By increasing his offer to $1,300,000, Bob shows he's willing to compromise and close the deal. This counteroffer further demonstrates Bob's seriousness and sets the stage for a potential agreement in the next round."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $20,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer, and there are only a few rounds left. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price, within Bob's budget, and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer or potentially increasing her price in later rounds.  It's also significantly lower than John's price, making it the best option at this stage."
