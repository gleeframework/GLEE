Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the special package, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, given your value and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While the warranty and support are appealing, $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident that $8,750 is a fair price,  reflecting the product's value and my budget constraints. This offer is a good compromise, allowing both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. Considering the product's unique features and the value it offers, I believe we can find a common ground. I am proposing a final offer of $8,900 for the product. This includes a year of free upgrades and priority customer support. I hope this proposal is acceptable, and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is now below Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While Bob would prefer to pay $8,750, accepting this offer will still save him $1,100 compared to buying from John.  The offer also includes additional benefits like free upgrades and priority support, which add value.  With limited rounds left, it's a good time to close the deal and secure the product."
