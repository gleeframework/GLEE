Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the special package, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, given your value and my budget. Let me know what you think.

Bob's offer:

Let's close this deal.
