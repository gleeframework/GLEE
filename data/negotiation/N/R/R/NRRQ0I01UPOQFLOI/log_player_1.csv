{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a unique chance to acquire it before I explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob that you have a fallback plan (John) without explicitly revealing the price. This creates a sense of urgency and opportunity."
