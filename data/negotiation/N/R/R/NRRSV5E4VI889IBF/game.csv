"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $15000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $18000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your offer, Alice, but I still feel that $18000 is too high. I would like to propose $16000 as a fair price for the product.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 still falls short of what this product is truly worth. Let's split the difference - I'm offering you the product for $17000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. ",17000.0,Alice,5,
