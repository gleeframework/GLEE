{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for the full $100, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept.  Since Bob values the product at $80, there's room for negotiation, and I'll be ready to adjust my price if needed. I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to pay the full $100. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but I'll be willing to move a bit to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $82.50. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $82.50 isn't my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's a good compromise, and I'd rather sell to Bob than risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
