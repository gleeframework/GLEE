"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to pay the full $100. Can you consider my offer?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little closer to what I need.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $82.50. Can you consider this offer?",82.5,Bob,4,
