Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, I still need to make a profit, so I can offer you a price of $130. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be moving away from a reasonable price. It's unlikely she'll go down to $120 or less, and I can get the product for $120 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation."
