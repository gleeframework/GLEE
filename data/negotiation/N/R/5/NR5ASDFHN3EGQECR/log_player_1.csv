"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob than to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is still significantly lower than what I want for the product. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
I'm offering Bob a price of $11,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. Hopefully, this will incentivize Bob to accept the deal while still being a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a bit more. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $10,750. This is a small increase from his last offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still remaining firm on my expectations.  It's a calculated risk, but I believe Bob might be willing to meet me in the middle at this point."
