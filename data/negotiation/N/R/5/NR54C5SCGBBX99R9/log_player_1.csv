Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value, and I believe it will be a great asset for your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth and potential benefits for Bob to increase his interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A $1,200,000 offer allows for potential concessions without dipping below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Plan B:**  John's offer is a safety net, allowing me to walk away if negotiations with Bob become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's willing to negotiate.  There's a chance we can find a price we both agree on.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Having John's offer as a fallback option allows me to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point, but still acknowledging his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential profits.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This price is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting potential profits:** I'm emphasizing the potential benefits for Bob to incentivize him to accept.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose too much.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still maintaining a profitable price for me.  I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob's offer is only a slight increase from his previous offer, indicating that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a favorable outcome for me.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profitable sale.

**Conclusion:** 

It's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John at $1,500,000, guaranteeing a significant profit and avoiding the risk of further negotiations that may result in an even lower price."
