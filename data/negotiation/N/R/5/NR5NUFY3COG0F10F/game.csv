"Bob, while I understand your perspective, I'm still not comfortable with a price that low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about $900,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $890,000. This is a fair price considering your initial offer and my previous counteroffer.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to pay $890,000. I'm willing to go up to $882,500, but that's my final offer. If I don't get a better price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",882500.0,Bob,6,
