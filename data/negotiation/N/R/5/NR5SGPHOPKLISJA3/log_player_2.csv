"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $14,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting the price based on your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can explore if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm interested in the product but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to stay within the $13,000 range. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good price for Bob considering his goal of saving money.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price."
