"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than my initial asking price.  To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying that much. To start, I'd like to offer $800,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a substantial undervaluation of the product's worth and potential impact on your business.  I'm willing to negotiate, but we're quite far apart.  To move this forward, I'll come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point better reflects the value you'll gain.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my budget. While she's shown some willingness to negotiate, it's clear we're quite far apart. I need to continue pushing for a lower price before considering accepting."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects the potential value we've discussed.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and $1,100,000 is certainly a more reasonable starting point. However, to be candid, the product's value to you far exceeds even my previous offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a substantial investment on your part, but one that promises a significant return. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm starting to get closer to my maximum, but I still need to push for a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  We're getting closer, though. To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we've discussed.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect that. $1,300,000 is a substantial offer. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a firm price, reflecting the product's true worth and the potential I see for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's final offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum threshold. I'm running out of rounds, but I need to hold firm and try one more counteroffer. The threat of another buyer might make her more flexible."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your situation, and I value our ongoing negotiation. However, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget.  To demonstrate my genuine interest and commitment, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise given the potential value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
