"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us. Let's get this deal done.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $10,500 is not possible, but $10,600 is my final offer?",10600.0,Bob,6,
