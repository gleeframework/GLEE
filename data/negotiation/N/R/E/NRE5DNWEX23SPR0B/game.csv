"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1050000. This would leave some room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to compromise, however.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1100000. This reflects a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1075000? This would ensure we both get a good deal, and I can proceed with the purchase.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
