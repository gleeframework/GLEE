Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** My message highlights the product's value while also mentioning the potential for a ""fair profit"" for Bob, encouraging him to consider the deal.
* **Room to Compromise:** This initial offer allows me to negotiate down if needed while still exceeding my minimum value of $1,000,000 if I sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly below my ideal price point.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. He's shown interest, and I can use this to my advantage.
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $875,000? This price acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with $875,000, which is exactly halfway between our current positions. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize a ""fair profit"" for both of us and position this offer as a way to ""close the deal"". 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** I'm avoiding selling to John at this point, as I believe there's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
