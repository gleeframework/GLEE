"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $875,000? This price acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
