"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to go, and you might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in your product, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range. 
* **Show Interest:** The message conveys interest in the product while also establishing a clear price point. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer provides a starting point for negotiations, with room for both parties to compromise.
* **Avoid Going Too Low:** Starting at a much lower price could make Alice less likely to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this game-changing product, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly your maximum budget.  Since you can also get the product from John for the same price, it's a good time to accept the offer. 

* **No Need for Further Negotiation:**  Accepting the offer saves time and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers. 
* **Same Price as John:** There's no financial advantage to going with John, so accepting Alice's offer is a good decision."
