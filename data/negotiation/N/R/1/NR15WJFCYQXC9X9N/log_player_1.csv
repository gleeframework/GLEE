{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price, but leaves some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects it, I can still potentially get a better price through counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $10,500. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,750. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price. Accepting this offer will net me a decent profit, and continuing to negotiate might lead to further back and forth without a guarantee of a better price. It's time to close the deal."
