"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,500,000 represents a fair value considering its potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but we're still significantly above his perceived value of $800,000. We have room to negotiate and try to draw him closer to at least $1,200,000 before considering accepting or taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. Let's settle this at $1,250,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer to Bob's limit and our own acceptable range.  By stating this is our final offer, we increase pressure on Bob to accept a price significantly higher than his initial offer while still leaving room for him to counter if he's truly set on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is getting closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could potentially squeeze a bit more from Bob, accepting his offer at $1,050,000 is a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away. It's always possible he could back out, so securing a deal now is the most logical choice."
