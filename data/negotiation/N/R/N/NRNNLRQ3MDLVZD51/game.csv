"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $75. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $85, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",85.0,Alice,5,
