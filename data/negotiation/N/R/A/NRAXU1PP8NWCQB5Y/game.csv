"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,000? That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's try to make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
