"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree it's a great product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's true value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. How about we try $11,500? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I feel like that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about we try $11,250? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer but there's still a gap. I'm willing to move up slightly to $9,750.  If that works, we have a deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,250 and $9,750. How about we try $10,500? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  This is my final offer, $10,000.  If you can't do that, I'll have to go with John.",10000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. How about we meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,000? I'm willing to do one more compromise. Let's try $10,500 again.",10500.0,Alice,9,
