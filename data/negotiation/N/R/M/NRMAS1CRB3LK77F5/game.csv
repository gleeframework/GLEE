"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I'm afraid $6,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise that benefits both of us!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",8500.0,Alice,5,
