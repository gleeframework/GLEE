Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and emphasize the ""deal"" aspect to encourage Bob's interest.
* **John as backup:** I'm keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $15,000, which gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's rejection shows he's willing to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than his initial counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is the safer choice:** I can secure a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so it's more advantageous to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, but with the knowledge that John is my backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $13,000?  That gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with $13,000, which is halfway between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on my value.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and direct, explaining my reasoning behind the counteroffer and emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob. 
* **Strategic compromise:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to go back to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $12,500 is very close to my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Time pressure:** Bob is indicating a willingness to make a quick decision, which puts pressure on me to accept or risk losing him as a buyer. 
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though it's not my ideal price, accepting this offer could lead to future business opportunities with Bob.  He's shown he's willing to negotiate and is a potential repeat customer. 

While John's offer is higher, accepting Bob's offer allows me to make a quick sale while potentially building a relationship for future transactions."
