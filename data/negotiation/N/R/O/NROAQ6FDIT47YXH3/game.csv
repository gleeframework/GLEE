"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This would still allow you a good profit margin and would be a great deal for me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and would still be a profitable sale for you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,5,
