"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I would be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about $8,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for you",8500.0,Alice,5,
