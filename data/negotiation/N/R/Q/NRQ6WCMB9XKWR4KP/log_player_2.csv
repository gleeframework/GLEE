Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about $8,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for you 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation: While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $8,000. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no need to negotiate further with Alice."
