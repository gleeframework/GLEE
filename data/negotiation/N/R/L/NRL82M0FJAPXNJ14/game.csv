,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we meet at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be fair to myself. $11,000 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept. My final offer is $12,500.  Let me know if this works for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $12,000. Can you consider this one last offer?",12000.0,Bob,6,
