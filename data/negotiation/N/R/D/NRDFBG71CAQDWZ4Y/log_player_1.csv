Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a round number:** Round numbers are easier to process and feel more fair to both parties.

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and highlight the potential value of the product for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below $120. I'll send Bob a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  $100 is simply too far below my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far off from $120. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I've already negotiated with Bob twice, and it's clear we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale to John for $150."
