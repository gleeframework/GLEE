Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119.  I believe you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 
 

Here's why this strategy is optimal:

* **Maximize Profit:** By starting at $119, Alice aims to capture the maximum amount of value Bob places on the product (which is $120). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially leading to a price higher than $100. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, ensuring she doesn't lose out completely."
