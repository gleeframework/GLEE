"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This first offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially set the tone for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if he's truly interested in paying a higher price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is closer to what I was hoping for, I'm still willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground. This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also emphasizes the product's value to Bob. I believe $95 is a reasonable price that still allows me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm still able to make a decent profit with this price, so accepting his offer is the best option. It's better to secure a sale and earn $85 than to risk losing the deal and having to settle for $80 from John."
