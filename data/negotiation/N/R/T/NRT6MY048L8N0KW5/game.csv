"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,100,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. This product holds substantial value, and I'm confident it can bring you a significant return. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
