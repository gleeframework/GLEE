"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair given the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Bob should buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than what John is offering, so it's in Bob's best interest to go with the lower price."
