"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a significant investment for me but I'm confident the value is there.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is still too far below my minimum. How about we meet at $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while ensuring you get a great deal on this valuable product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
