"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. Starting with a lower offer allows for this.
* **Aiming for Under Budget:** Ideally, we want to secure the product for less than $80, leaving us with some savings. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  Our counter-offer is low, but it opens the door for Alice to counter back, and we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me. Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved down from her initial offer, which is a positive sign. 
* **Still Above Target:**  $85 is still more than we want to pay and closer to John's price. 
* **Negotiation Power:**  We still have rounds to negotiate and can try to nudge Alice closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $70 is low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We've moved up significantly from our initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $77 is still below Alice's value of $80, giving her a small incentive to accept while staying under our target. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are aware of the limited rounds and want to move towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I could go as low as $82, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Limit:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and it's only $2 above our ideal price.
* **Time Factor:** We have fewer rounds remaining, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential savings of a few dollars by continuing are outweighed by the risk of Alice refusing further negotiation and losing the deal entirely."
