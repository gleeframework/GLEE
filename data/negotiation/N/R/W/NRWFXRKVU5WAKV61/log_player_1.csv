Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to Bob's perceived value without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $950,000 is still a good deal for me, but I believe I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $975,000.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to secure a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price.  I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids further back-and-forth."
