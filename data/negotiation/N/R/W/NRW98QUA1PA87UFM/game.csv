,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you a little closer to the middle at $95.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider my other options.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $100. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,5,
