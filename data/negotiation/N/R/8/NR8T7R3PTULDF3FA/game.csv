"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
