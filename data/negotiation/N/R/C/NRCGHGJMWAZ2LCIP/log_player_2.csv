"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something that will significantly benefit your business. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $15,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further, getting you a better deal. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for potential negotiation."
