"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great compromise, considering the value it holds for you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm firm on $95.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me buy the product without exceeding my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great value for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",105.0,Alice,5,
