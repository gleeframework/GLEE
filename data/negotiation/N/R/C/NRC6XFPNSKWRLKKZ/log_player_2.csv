"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $110 to Alice and only $80 to you.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great compromise, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum value of $80.  I'll reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm firm on $95.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me buy the product without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great value for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is $105, which is still above my maximum budget of $80.  It's time to stop negotiating and buy from John for $80 to ensure I get the product within my price range."
