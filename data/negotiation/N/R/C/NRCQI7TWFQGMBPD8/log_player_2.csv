"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth a significant amount to me, at least $800,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects the potential value it holds for your business.  Let's discuss a price of $1,200,000.  This would be a mutually beneficial arrangement, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit. Her statement about the product being worth at least $800,000 to her is likely a negotiation tactic to anchor the price high.
* **Your Alternatives:** You have a backup option with John at $1,500,000.  This means you should never pay more than that.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that the price is too high. There's a good chance she'll come back with a lower offer, given that anything above $800,000 is profitable for her.

**Strategy:**

It's in your best interest to see if Alice will reduce the price further."
