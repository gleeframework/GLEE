"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the investment for you. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 still falls short of my minimum value. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000 as a final concession. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's close this deal now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle?",990000.0,Bob,6,
