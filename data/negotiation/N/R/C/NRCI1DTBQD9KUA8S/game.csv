"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,250 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Considering the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit, I'm willing to go down to $10,750.  This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your final offer, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and $10,000, which would be $10,375. Can you consider that?",10375.0,Bob,6,
