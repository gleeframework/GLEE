Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully maximize my profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'll be keeping John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and far less than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, and I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to his last offer, but still reflects the value of the product to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a smaller decrease from my previous offer, and closer to Bob's latest offer.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit. If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we've been through several rounds of negotiation. At this point, I'm concerned that we may not be able to reach an agreement.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get a decent price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
