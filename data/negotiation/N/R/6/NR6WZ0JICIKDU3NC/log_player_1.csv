This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value while still ensuring I earn a good amount.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I understand its value is higher, but this is my maximum budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is still a significant amount, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,150,000 or even higher. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? That would give you a great deal, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to work this out, as I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
