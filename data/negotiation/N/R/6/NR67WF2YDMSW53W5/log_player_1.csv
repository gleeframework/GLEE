Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, giving Bob room to negotiate. It also allows for some potential profit for me.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a lower price than my initial offer, showing some willingness to compromise. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not comfortable selling for $1,150,000. I'd rather sell to John for $1,200,000 and guarantee myself a decent profit. It's not as much as I initially hoped for, but it's better than selling for a lower price."
