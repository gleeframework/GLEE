"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,250,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  While I value it at $1,500,000, I'm willing to negotiate to make this deal work for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John at $1,000,000 is the best option for Bob."
