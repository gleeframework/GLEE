# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that's truly worth $1,200,000 to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $1,200,000 and Alice is offering it for $900,000. This means you'll save $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You can still make a profit.** Even at $900,000, you're getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to maximize your savings."
