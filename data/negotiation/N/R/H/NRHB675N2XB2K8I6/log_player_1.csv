"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Safety Net:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  He is offering $12,000, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **No need to risk it:**  While I could try to negotiate a higher price, there's no guarantee I'll get it. 
* **Time is money:**  By accepting, I secure the sale and avoid potentially wasting rounds. 
* **John is always an option:**  If I was desperate, John is a guaranteed backup, but I'm not in that situation right now."
