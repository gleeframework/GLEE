"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. This shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to bridge the gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair compromise considering the potential value of the product. Let's aim for a quick resolution.",800000.0,Bob,4,
