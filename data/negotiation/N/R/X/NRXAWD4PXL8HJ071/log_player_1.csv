{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives you an opportunity to assess Bob's interest and whether he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's not worth selling the product for such a low price when you have a guaranteed buyer in John.  It's better to try and negotiate with Bob further, or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
