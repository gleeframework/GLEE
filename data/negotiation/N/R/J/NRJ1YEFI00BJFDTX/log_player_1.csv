Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $12,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. While I appreciate your product, I am unable to meet you at $15000. I would like to propose $13000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to offer you the product for $14,000. It's a fair price, and it gives you a chance to get a fantastic product at a great deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet you at $14000. I would like to propose $13500 as a compromise. This is a reasonable price for both of us, considering the value of the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
