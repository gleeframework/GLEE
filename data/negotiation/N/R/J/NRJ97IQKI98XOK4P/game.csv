"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This gives you a decent discount and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my means.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,080,000? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement.  I'm willing to drop my price one last time to $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. If you're not willing to pay this, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to drop the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,080,000 and $1,125,000. Would you consider $1,102,500? I'm really interested in this product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget.",1102500.0,Bob,8,
