(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, I'm still willing to negotiate further. There's a chance I can get a slightly better price by making one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from my previous offer and is only $25,000 over my maximum budget. Since we're at the final stages of negotiation, this offer signals a strong intent to purchase while still trying to squeeze out a little more savings.  If Alice rejects this offer, I will be forced to accept John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is just above my maximum budget, and I've already made a counteroffer that was rejected.  It's unlikely that I can get Alice to go lower, so it's more beneficial to purchase from John at this point."
