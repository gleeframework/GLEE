{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By offering $1,000,000, I leave room for Bob to counter-offer without immediately pushing him towards a rejection.
* **Avoiding John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, I want to explore negotiating with Bob first. It's possible I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000 with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.
* I'll be mindful of the time spent negotiating, and if it seems like the process is dragging on or Bob is not serious about buying, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between his $850,000 offer and my desired price. 
* I will carefully consider how high I'm willing to go, keeping in mind the value of the product to me and the potential time commitment of continued negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a chance to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering $950,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While I'm willing to lower my price, I'm not giving in completely. $950,000 is still well above Bob's perceived value and gives me a good starting point for further negotiations.
* **Positive Messaging:**  My message emphasizes the deal's value for Bob and uses positive language to encourage him to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully evaluate his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or move on to John. 
* I'll continue to assess the time commitment and potential risk associated with continued negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would mean a considerable financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I've shown flexibility by lowering my price twice, and Bob has also demonstrated willingness to compromise. This suggests there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially considering John's offer of $1,200,000.  

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* I'll try to find a middle ground that is more appealing to both of us, potentially by focusing on the value proposition of the product for Bob.
* I'll keep an eye on the time spent negotiating and the potential risks of delaying the sale, making sure not to lose sight of John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've both invested in this negotiation.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering $975,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows a continued commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Highlighting Value and Investment:**  My message emphasizes the product's value and the time we've both invested in the negotiation, making it more likely for Bob to see the benefit in agreeing to a slightly higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $975,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it provides room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling pressured to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully evaluate his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or move on to John.
* I'll continue to monitor the time spent negotiating and the potential risks of delaying the sale, ensuring I don't lose sight of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close to a deal, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would mean a considerable financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  While Bob has shown willingness to compromise, we've reached a point where our prices are close, but not quite aligned. Continuing to negotiate might not result in a significantly better outcome.
* **Time is Money:**  The negotiation has gone on for several rounds. It's important to weigh the potential gains of further negotiation against the time and effort involved.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make one final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I will use a  firm but fair approach, highlighting the value proposition of the product for Bob.
* If Bob rejects, I will move on to John. The negotiation has reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risks and time commitment. John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 is the more secure option at this point."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I've been very flexible throughout this negotiation, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've both invested.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making a final counteroffer, emphasizing that it's the last chance to reach an agreement. This creates urgency and pressure on Bob to reconsider.

* **Highlighting Value and Investment:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value and the time invested in the negotiation, reminding Bob of the benefits of reaching a deal. 
* **Threat of Moving On:**  I'm subtly threatening to move on to John, making Bob aware that he might miss out on the product.
