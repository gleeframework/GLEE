"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? It's still a fair price for you, considering its value to you, and a good starting point for us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, would you be open to selling it for $12,200?",12200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,200 is a bit too low for me right now. Let's try $12,300. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a good compromise.",12300.0,Alice,5,
