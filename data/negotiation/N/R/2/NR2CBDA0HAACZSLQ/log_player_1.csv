Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's on offer and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the price is right. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000 again. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,162,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,162,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Accepting $1,162,500 would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment. I can adjust my price to $1,190,000. This offer reflects my desire to close a deal while ensuring a fair price for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has significantly dropped his offer from his previous offers and is now moving further away from the desired price point. This indicates he might be trying to lowball at this stage.  It's crucial to hold firm and signal that I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues the product. I'm still prepared to negotiate, but I need to see Bob moving back towards a more reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be transparent. While I'm committed to reaching a deal with you, I also have other interested parties. My bottom line for this product is $1,150,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to signal a stronger stance. Bob's last offer was a significant step back, so I'm drawing a line in the sand. By presenting my bottom line and mentioning other interested parties, I'm creating a sense of urgency and reminding him that this opportunity won't last forever. This approach aims to bring him back to the negotiating table with a more realistic offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my limits. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is not showing a willingness to meet near the realistic price point. Even though he is still negotiating, his offers are getting further away from my bottom line, not closer. It's unlikely he'll suddenly jump to an acceptable price in the remaining two rounds.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a respectable profit and avoids the risk of Bob's lowballing tactics."
