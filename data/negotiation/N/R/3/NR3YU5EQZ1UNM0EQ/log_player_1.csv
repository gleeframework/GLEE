Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $9,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring Alice gets a significantly higher price than John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While Alice could start at $10,000, it might make Bob less willing to negotiate. Offering a slightly lower price initially can create a sense of goodwill. 
 
This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring the sale and avoiding the risk of having to accept John's lower offer."
