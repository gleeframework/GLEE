"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be selling this product which I know you'd find valuable.  I'm thinking of an initial offer of $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to me ($10,000). I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John for $10,000, so I'll reject this initial offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum value of $10,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing I'm serious about getting a better price.  This allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate while keeping the door open to a deal that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum value.  While she's moved closer to my initial counteroffer, it's still too high.  I'll reject and counteroffer again. I have rounds to spare, and the longer we negotiate, the more likely it is that Alice will be willing to accept a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. If you're serious about selling, I think this is a fair price for us both."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer, but staying below my maximum value of $10,000. It's a small increase from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  I'm also reminding Alice that I have other options (buying from John), so there's a clear incentive for her to accept."
