"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. It's worth seeing if she'll come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming for the ideal:** I'm aiming for Alice's valuation of the product ($100) as my first counteroffer. It's ambitious but gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and direct:** The message is polite, acknowledges Alice's initial offer, and clearly states my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $110. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Alice came down in price, indicating a willingness to negotiate. I believe there's still room to reach a better price, so I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** Alice came down $10 from her original offer, so it's reasonable to meet her halfway at $105. This shows willingness to compromise while still striving for a better deal. 
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and appreciative tone, emphasizing the collaborative nature of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer the product to you for $115. Is this something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the limit:** Alice is signaling she's close to her bottom line. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll become less flexible. 
* **Acceptable price:** $115 is a reasonable compromise. It's below my maximum budget and significantly less than John's offer. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the opportunity by pushing too hard."
