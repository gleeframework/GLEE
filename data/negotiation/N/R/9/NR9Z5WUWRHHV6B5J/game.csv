"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $900,000 is my final offer.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000.  Let's split the difference - $887,500.  This is my final counteroffer. If you're serious about making this deal,  let's finalize it now.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $875,000. I'm starting to think about other options, including buying from John. Can you meet me at $875,000 or we can part ways?",875000.0,Bob,6,
