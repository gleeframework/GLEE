"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for reaching out.  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Anchoring:** By offering $60, we aim to shift the negotiation's focus towards a lower price range. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will help us understand how much Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down from her initial offer, $130 is still significantly higher than our target price of $80 and even further from our initial offer of $60. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's still room to lower the price further.
* **John's Offer:** It's good to keep John's $80 offer in mind as a fallback option if we can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we try $80? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** We're now offering our maximum price. This shows Alice we're serious buyers but have a firm budget.
* **Justification:** By stating it's a fair price for both parties, we appeal to a sense of fairness in the negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're halfway through the rounds. It's time to see if Alice is willing to accept a price within our budget."
