Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is my best offer and reflects the product's worth."",

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I need to be closer to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is still a bit rich for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000.  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below John's standing offer. We're getting closer to a point where we might need to settle, but we can still try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's make it $14,000 and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're now very close to John's offer. This offer puts pressure on Bob to either accept a price close to our desired amount or risk us walking away and taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  How about $12,000? That's a significant increase on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to meet our price target at this point. We've negotiated well, but we have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000.  It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
