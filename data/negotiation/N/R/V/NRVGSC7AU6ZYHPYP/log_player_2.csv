# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

You can do better than $1,350,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm confident that the true value of this product is closer to  $1,300,000.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is a good deal for me.  It's worth accepting this offer and avoiding further negotiation."
