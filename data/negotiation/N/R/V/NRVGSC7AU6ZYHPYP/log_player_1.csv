Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate and  give Bob the impression of getting a deal if we eventually settle closer to his perceived value. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer. This gives me leverage and a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for me.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is substantial, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  He's acknowledged the product's value, and I'm confident I can secure a price closer to $1,300,000. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm confident that the true value of this product is closer to  $1,300,000.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $1,250,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. This common negotiation tactic can feel like a win-win for both parties.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to keep Bob anchored to the higher end of the potential price range. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not rushing to accept his offer, signaling that I believe in the product's worth and am prepared to walk away if I don't get a price that reflects that."
