"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable asset that could be a great addition to your business.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle, say around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground and make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a little steeper than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which I believe is a fair and competitive price.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,
