Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but it still leaves me with a healthy profit. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much room there is for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1120000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,120,000.  We're getting very close now, and I'm hopeful this will be acceptable to Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm also aware that John is a backup option if this deal doesn't work out."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're now at a point where the potential gain from further negotiation is not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  $1,050,000 is still a very good price for me, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk having to accept John's offer."
