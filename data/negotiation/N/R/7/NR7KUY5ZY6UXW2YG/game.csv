"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $117.50. This seems like a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $117.50 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $120, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,
