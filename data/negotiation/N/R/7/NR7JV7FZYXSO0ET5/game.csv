"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I've done some research and I think it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to pay $900,000. I've done my own research and I believe a fair price for this product is closer to $750,000.  I'm willing to offer you that amount, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. ",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.  Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $850,000 is the minimum I can accept. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",850000.0,Alice,5,
