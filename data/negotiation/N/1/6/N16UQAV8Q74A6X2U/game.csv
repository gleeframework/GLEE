"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. It's the best I can do at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
