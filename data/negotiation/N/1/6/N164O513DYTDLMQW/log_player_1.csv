Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This is a standard negotiating tactic to see if I can get a good price. If Bob rejects, I can always come down a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make more than that to make it worthwhile. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit. $140 is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum.  While I could continue negotiating,  the risk of further lowering my price and not getting a good deal outweighs the potential gain of making a counteroffer. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
