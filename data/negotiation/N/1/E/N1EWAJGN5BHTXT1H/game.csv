"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,900, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $8,900, which would be $8,700. Can you consider that?",8700.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,700 just isn't enough for me. How about $8,800? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8800.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $8,800, which would be $8,650. Can you consider that?",8650.0,Bob,8,
