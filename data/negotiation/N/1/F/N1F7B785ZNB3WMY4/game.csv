"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still willing to come down a little, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about $110? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, so how about $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
