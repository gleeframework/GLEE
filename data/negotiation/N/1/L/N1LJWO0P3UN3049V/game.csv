"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,200,000. Let me know if that's something you can work with.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,400,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,400,000 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,350,000. This is a final offer, as I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000 if we can't reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
