"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for your specific needs. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer ($1,100,000) that's slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This aims to:
    * Gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate.
    * Leave room for potential concessions while staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value without being aggressive.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** We haven't revealed our minimum price, giving us flexibility in future rounds. 

This strategy seeks to maximize our potential gain while leaving options open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below his perceived value of $1,200,000 and our initial asking price. We have room to negotiate.  We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Considering the value this product brings, I propose $1,025,000."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We lower our price by $75,000, signaling willingness to negotiate but also showing we're firm on securing a strong price.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:**  This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation towards a price around $1,000,000, which is a substantial gain for us and still a reasonable deal for Bob considering his perceived value.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** We continue to use positive language, emphasizing the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify going above $950,000.  Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating progress. However, the gap between his current offer ($950,000) and our desired range (closer to $1,000,000) is still significant. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can bridge this gap. Selling to John for $800,000 is still our backup option, but we're aiming higher with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Let's make this work - how about we settle right in the middle at $987,500? This ensures a fair outcome for both of us."",
""product_price"": 987500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer directly addresses Bob's latest offer and our previous one, proposing a compromise by meeting exactly in the middle. 
* **Promoting Fairness:** By framing it as a ""fair outcome,"" we appeal to a sense of mutuality and encourage Bob to accept a price closer to our desired range.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We want to guide the negotiation towards a close and avoid dragging it out unnecessarily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  To be honest, my absolute top end is $970,000.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has presented his ""absolute top end"" offer. While not ideal, it's a solid price at $970,000 and significantly above our fallback option of $800,000 with John.  

* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could push Bob away or lead to a stalemate. Accepting now secures a very good deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later carries its own value, even if it means slightly less than our aspirational target."
