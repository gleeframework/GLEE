Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price, or if he'll counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more than $120, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's better to sell to Bob than to John, as it avoids the risk of John backing out or not being available."
