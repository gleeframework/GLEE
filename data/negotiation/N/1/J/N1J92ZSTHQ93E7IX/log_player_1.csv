Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he'd theoretically be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $8,000 from John, so any offer below that is pointless. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with a strong offer close to Bob's maximum allows you to potentially secure the highest profit.  There's room to negotiate down slightly if needed while still staying well above your minimum."
