"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its features and value, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $6,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Could you consider something closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $18,000 is still a little too high for my budget. Could you do $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me.  To make this happen, I could come down to $14,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $14,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $13,000?  That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for this product.",13000.0,Alice,7,
