"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $180 to start. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his initial offer of $120, which is my absolute minimum.  There's little incentive to continue negotiating as it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. John offers a guaranteed $120, making it the safer and more efficient option."
