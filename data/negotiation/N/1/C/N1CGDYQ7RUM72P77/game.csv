"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and exclusive opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind product that I believe will greatly benefit your business.

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering the value I've seen so far. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to consider $1100000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and potential benefits to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1100000, which is $975000. However, I can go a bit higher and offer $950000. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $950000, which would be $1025000. This price takes into account the benefits you'll gain from the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to drive the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1050000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1075000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
