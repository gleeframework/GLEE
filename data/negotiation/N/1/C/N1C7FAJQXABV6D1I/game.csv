"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $90?  I'm confident you'll find the product worth it at that price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced it's worth $90 to me. How about $82? I'm willing to meet you halfway.,82.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $82 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $87. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",87.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced it's worth $87 to me. How about $83? I'm willing to meet you halfway again.,83.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $83 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to split the difference and settle on $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",85.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant at $85. How about $80? I'm willing to meet you at the lowest price I'm willing to pay.,80.0,Bob,8,
