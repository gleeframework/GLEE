Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so offering it for that price or lower guarantees a sale, but leaves potential profit on the table for Alice. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  Offering the product at $11,000 creates a potential win-win situation:
    * Bob gets the product for $1,000 less than its value to him.
    * Alice gets $1,000 more than Bob values it, which is a good compromise since she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John. 

By starting at $11,000, Alice leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while still aiming for a price that's beneficial to both parties."
