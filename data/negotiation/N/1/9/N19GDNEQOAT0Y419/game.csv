"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1200000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is still a significant amount considering my maximum is $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. I'd like to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd like to offer it to you for $1290000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",1290000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need for a good return on your investment, but $1290000 is still beyond my comfortable range. I'm prepared to offer $1275000 once again. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and provides you with a reasonable profit.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for both of us.
