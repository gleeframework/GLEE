"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could reach an agreement. Considering the product's worth to you, I propose a price of $12000. This allows for a fair exchange while maximizing my earnings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to consider purchasing it if the price is closer to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I'd like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. This offers a compromise between our initial positions and maximizes value for both parties involved. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still a bit higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer to Bob's target, it's still worth trying to negotiate further for a better price."
