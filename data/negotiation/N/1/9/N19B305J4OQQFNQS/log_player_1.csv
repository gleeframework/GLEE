Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to try to get closer to my target price before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's still a great price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'm still hesitant to sell to John for $8,000, as I believe there's potential to get a higher price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm only able to go down to $8,200. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to meeting you halfway. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this offer."", ""product_price"": 8200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $7,900 is getting closer, I don't have many rounds left to negotiate, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly higher price.  Selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed outcome, which is a safe bet given the time constraints."
