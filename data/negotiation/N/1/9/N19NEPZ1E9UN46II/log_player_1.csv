Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John acts as a guaranteed buyer at $150, Alice wants to get as close to that price as possible from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $149, there might be a small window for Bob to negotiate a slightly lower price, still netting Alice more than her minimum."
