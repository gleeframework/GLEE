"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate the movement.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
