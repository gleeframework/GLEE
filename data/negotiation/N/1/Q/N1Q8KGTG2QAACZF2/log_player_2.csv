"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

The product is worth $120 to Bob.  Alice's offer is too high. It makes sense to reject and counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about we split the difference at $130?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is closer to his target, he can still try to get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price for the product.  However, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $128,  but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 128}
