Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130. This is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still below my minimum threshold of $150. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value of the product for Bob while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Strategy:**  By starting with a price closer to my minimum, I have room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer. I also leave the option open for a quick deal if Bob is willing to accept the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a better price than Bob's initial perceived value of $80, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob, and I am willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my cost. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $120, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of my counteroffer. I'm also leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.  By showing flexibility and being reasonable, I hope to reach a deal that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your costs. Thank you for your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150, which is significantly higher.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially since there's no guarantee I can get him to budge further.  Selling to John is the most profitable and risk-free option at this point."
