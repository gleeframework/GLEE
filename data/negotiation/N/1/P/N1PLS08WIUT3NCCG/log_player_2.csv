"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm confident you'll see the value in making a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product and willing to pay a fair price, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be comfortable with.

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but $1,050,000 is still above my target. I'll try to negotiate further."

I'm very serious about buying this product, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we split the difference at $950,000? This would give you a decent profit while still staying within my financial limits."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. Considering the value of the product and the effort I've invested, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again. I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $1,020,000, which is still a great deal for you. I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

Alice's offer is still too high for me. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. It's better to secure the product from John at a lower price, even though it means losing some potential value."
