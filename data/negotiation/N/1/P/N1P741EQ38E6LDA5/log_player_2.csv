"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'll sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price point. You have a better option with John, who is willing to sell for $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price, but it's important to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm sure you can find another buyer, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $950000. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum price point of $1,000,000.  You have a guaranteed deal with John at that price, so it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's a good chance you could get her down further, but the risk of her rejecting your next counteroffer and potentially going back up in price isn't worth the potential savings."
