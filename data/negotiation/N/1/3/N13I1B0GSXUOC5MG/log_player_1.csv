Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $120, but it's lower than what you could get from John.  This strategy aims to strike a balance: 

* **It's attractive to Bob:** He gets a discount compared to your price for John.
* **It's profitable for you:** You still get a good price, especially considering your minimum value of $150.

If Bob rejects, you'll get $150 from John, but you're hoping to close the deal with Bob for a slightly higher price."
