"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is better than her product's value to her ($150), you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off going with the guaranteed lower price."
