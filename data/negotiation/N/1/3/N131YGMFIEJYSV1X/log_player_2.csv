Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but that's still quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, $1,000,000 is my absolute limit. If we can make a deal work at that price, I'm ready to buy today."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I've tried to show flexibility on the price.  To get this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe that represents a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation. While Alice has come down significantly, she's still far above our target price and John's offer. Continuing to counter-offer keeps the pressure on Alice to make further concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm serious about that $1,000,000 mark.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I might need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are now firmly reiterating our top price and introducing a mild threat of walking away. This signals to Alice that we're serious and increases the pressure for her to accept our offer or risk losing the sale."
