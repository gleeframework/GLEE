"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there is still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the gesture, but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10,500 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still below Bob's maximum budget of $15,000 and offers a good compromise.  Accepting the offer will save Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could reject and stick to her price.  This would leave Bob with the less desirable option of buying from John."
