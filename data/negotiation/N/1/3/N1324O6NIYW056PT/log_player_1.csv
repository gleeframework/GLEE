Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While the offer is close to your minimum, a slight discount might entice Bob without losing too much potential profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay. If you had that information, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
