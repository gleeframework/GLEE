Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to see a higher offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $800,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This reflects the unique value and potential of this opportunity. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1200000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me in the middle?

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's offers are still too low, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd like to get more, John's offer is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing him altogether."
