Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I want to start with a significantly higher offer to explore the possibility of maximizing my profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $2,000,000 offer provides room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $1,500,000.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high asking price and portray confidence in the product's worth.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can confidently walk away knowing I have a sale secured."
