,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you considering me.  However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $125.  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $135. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. How about we meet at $132? It's a compromise that works for me, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $132 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $125. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. How about we meet at $128? It's a bit closer to your offer, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $128 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's meet in the middle at $126. I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. ",126.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $126. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. How about we meet at $129?
