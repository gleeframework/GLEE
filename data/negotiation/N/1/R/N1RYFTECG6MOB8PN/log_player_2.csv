Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  While $11,500 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is already a very competitive price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  The price is still within his budget and is a significant savings from buying from John. This is a good deal for Bob and a reasonable compromise with Alice."
