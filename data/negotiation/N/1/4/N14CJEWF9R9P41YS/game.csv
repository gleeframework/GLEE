"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $150 is just too low for me. How about $165? That's a fair price for both of us.",165.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, I can't go any lower than $160. This price still leaves some room for me to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've reviewed our previous discussions and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I would like to propose a price of $155 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and I hope it helps us reach an agreement.",155.0,Bob,6,
