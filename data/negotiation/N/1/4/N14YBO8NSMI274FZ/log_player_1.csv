"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but no higher. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $7,500 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away if I counter again."
