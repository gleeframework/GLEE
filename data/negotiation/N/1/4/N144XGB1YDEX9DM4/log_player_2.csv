"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but $12,000 is still a significant price. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to lower the price further. 
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.** If the negotiation fails, you can always go with John, but it's better to try to get a lower price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your desire to negotiate. 
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  $9,000 is still above Alice's minimum, giving her incentive to accept, but still within your budget. 
* **Sets the Tone for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer establishes that you're serious about getting a good deal and are willing to make reasonable moves."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has lowered her price from $12,000 to $10,000, which is a good compromise.
* **Close to Your Target:**  $10,000 is within your budget and significantly lower than what you'd pay John.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If you reject this offer, you might risk Alice becoming more stubborn or even backing out of the negotiation.

**It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price rather than risk getting a worse deal later.**"
