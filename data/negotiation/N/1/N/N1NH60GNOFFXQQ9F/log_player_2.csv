"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000 and higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This means there's room for both of you to benefit from the transaction. Accepting the offer allows you to save $3,000 compared to buying from John."
