"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's exactly what you value it at.  Let's make this deal happen!",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",8200.0,Alice,5,
