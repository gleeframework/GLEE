"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175, which is a reasonable starting point considering the product's value to both of us. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, it's still too low considering the value of the product. I'm going to counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price to $155. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum, it's getting close to John's offer and we're already halfway through the rounds. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer from Bob, so it's better to secure the sale now."
