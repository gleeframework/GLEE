"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $2,300,000 represents my initial assessment, I'm open to negotiation.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,950,000?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,750,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm working with a strict budget.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
