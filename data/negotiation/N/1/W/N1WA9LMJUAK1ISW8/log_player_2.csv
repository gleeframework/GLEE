"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, though. How about $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer. While $16,000 is better than $18,000, he can still get a better deal.  He should try to negotiate further before considering buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  How about $15,000? "", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you at $15,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer. While $15,500 is a little more than his ideal price, it's still a good deal compared to what he would pay John. He's only $500 over his budget, and it's likely he won't get a better deal with Alice."
