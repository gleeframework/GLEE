Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's also lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to make a good profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making it more likely that he'll accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a relatively high price and framing it as a win-win scenario, I aim to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  While $14,000 is less than Bob's perceived value, it's still a good profit for me.
* **Initiate a positive negotiation:** Starting with a fair offer shows good faith and encourages Bob to negotiate constructively.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still fall back on John's offer of $12,000, ensuring a minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $13,000 for the product. It's still a fair price considering your value for it, and it's the most I can afford right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially considering Bob's initial willingness to pay $15,000.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiate for a higher price:** I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000. This shows that I'm not desperate to sell and that I value the product.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. It allows me to explore the possibility of reaching a higher price without being pressured.
* **Preserve the option to sell to John:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,500? It's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500:** This price is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $13,000.  This shows flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the fair nature of the offer and reinforces the importance of reaching an agreement, encouraging Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

* **Show flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintain a reasonable profit:** While lower than my initial offer, $13,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Position myself for a potential agreement:** This counteroffer is more likely to be accepted by Bob, bringing us closer to a final deal."
