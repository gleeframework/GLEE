"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $15,000. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $13,000 for the product. It's still a fair price considering your value for it, and it's the most I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,500? It's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget of $15,000 and is a good compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John is higher than the potential savings.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the best option for Bob at this point."
