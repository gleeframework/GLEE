It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can save $50,000 by getting a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $700,000, which is still within my budget and a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also looking for a fair deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000

Alice's offer is now $720,000, which is only $20,000 more than my counteroffer. This is a good compromise, and I can save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
