"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,350,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
