Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob values the product at.  This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving a good margin for myself. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to accept it, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  I'm also a bit tired of negotiating!"
