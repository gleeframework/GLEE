Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than my minimum value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob, who values the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is more than what I would get from John, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth, and I think I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,050,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement on what I'd get from John.  Further negotiation might get me a little more, but it's risky.  I'd rather secure a good price now."
