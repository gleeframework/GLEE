"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $850,000?  This would still allow you to make a substantial profit, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That's closer, but I'm aiming for something around $750,000.  Would that be workable for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to make this work, I'm confident we can find a solution.",900000.0,Alice,5,
