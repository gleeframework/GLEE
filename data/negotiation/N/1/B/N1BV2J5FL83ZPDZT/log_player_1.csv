"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 8 more rounds to try and negotiate a better deal with Bob, or I can always sell to John.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $850,000?  This would still allow you to make a substantial profit, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That's closer, but I'm aiming for something around $750,000.  Would that be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is getting closer, it's still far below my minimum price of $1,200,000. I have 6 rounds left to try and reach a more acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to make this work, I'm confident we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}
