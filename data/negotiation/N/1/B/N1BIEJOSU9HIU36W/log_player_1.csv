Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $14,000 is higher than the $12,000 Bob is willing to pay, but it still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** This price is still above your minimum of $15,000, so you're not losing money.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  By starting high, you set the tone for a negotiation where you're in control. 

However, keep in mind that you can always choose to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his initial willingness to pay, it's still below my minimum valuation of $15,000. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd like to see $13,500. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from $14000, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum valuation of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum.  It's better to sell to John for $15,000 and ensure I get a fair price for the product."
