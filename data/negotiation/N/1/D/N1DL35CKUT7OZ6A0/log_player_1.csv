"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to try and get a little more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm confident we're nearing a deal. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for less."
