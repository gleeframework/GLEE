"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. Given the product's value, I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's unique value, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.  Let's see if we can agree.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
