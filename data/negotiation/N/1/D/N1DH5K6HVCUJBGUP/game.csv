"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my minimum asking price. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $1,000,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I see in the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the true value of the product and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and the potential benefits it can bring to my business.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is close, but I can't accept anything less than $875,000 for this product. It's a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value of the product and the benefits it can bring to my business.",825000.0,Bob,6,
