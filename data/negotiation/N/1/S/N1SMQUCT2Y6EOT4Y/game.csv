"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $1200000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product and I'm willing to pay $1100000.  This is a fair price considering your own value for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $1200000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is a significant amount for me.  Considering your stated value for the product, I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1280000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is no less than $1200000.
