"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business or personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to me is at least $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget ($1,200,000).  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, and buying from John will cost you the same amount, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice. You don't lose any money by accepting, and you might be getting a product worth more to Alice."
