Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and quality. What do you think?,9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering the value and quality of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Let's split the difference - I'll pay $11250. I think this would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm not quite ready to accept $11250. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, which is still a great price for the product. It's a fair compromise that I think would work for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
