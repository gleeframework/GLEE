"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer,  showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's likely that Alice will counter with a price closer to $750,000, but there's still potential for a deal in the $700,000 range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than buying from John and only $25,000 more than Bob's initial counteroffer.  Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting again and potentially increasing the price is too high. Accepting the offer secures a good price and avoids the uncertainty of additional rounds."
