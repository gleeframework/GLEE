"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a good price point, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This way, we both get a fair deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $8,200. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,200 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to go down to $8,600.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",8600.0,Alice,5,
