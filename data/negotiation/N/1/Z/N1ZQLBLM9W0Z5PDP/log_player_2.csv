"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this unique product for a price of $1,400,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers will be well worth it for you.  This is a limited time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save a considerable amount of money by rejecting this offer and going with John."
