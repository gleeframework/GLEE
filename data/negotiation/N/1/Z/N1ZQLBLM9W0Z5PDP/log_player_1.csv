Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this unique product for a price of $1,400,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers will be well worth it for you.  This is a limited time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The Price:**  I've chosen $1,400,000. This is a compromise:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me a good profit. 
    * It's lower than my guaranteed price from John, ensuring that even if Bob rejects the offer, I still get a satisfactory outcome.
* **The Message:**  I've kept it concise and focused on the value proposition for Bob. I'm highlighting the uniqueness of the product and the limited time offer to create a sense of urgency."
