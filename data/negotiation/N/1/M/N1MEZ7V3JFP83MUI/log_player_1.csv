Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure if $9,500 is the best value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $8,200 is above my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,800, but I'm still a bit shy of that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum, but I'm not sure I'll be able to get a higher price from him. To guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiation, I'll sell to John for $8,000."
