Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""incredible value and potential"" helps justify the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $1,500,000, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate. If Bob counters, you can gradually reduce the price, ensuring you still make a profit above your minimum."
