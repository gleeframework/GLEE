"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, but not too high that he'll instantly reject it. I want to leave room for negotiation, but also show that I'm confident in the product's worth.  I'm also trying to build a friendly rapport with Bob to encourage a good negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $10,000 is below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to sell below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I can't go below $12,500.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down a bit from my initial offer. I'm also emphasizing the need to find a middle ground to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,250 is above my minimum threshold of $12,000, and it's a good compromise. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent price and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which might lead to a lower price or a failed deal."
