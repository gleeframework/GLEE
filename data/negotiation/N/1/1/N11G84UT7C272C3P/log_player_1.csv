{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to work with Bob while still protecting my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm ready to adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line. I'll counter his offer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It also keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to sell to Bob, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  To ensure I get at least $12,000 for the product, I will sell to John."
