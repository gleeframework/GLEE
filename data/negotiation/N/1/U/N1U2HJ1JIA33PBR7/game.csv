"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value and could significantly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable arrangement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits.  To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This reflects my willingness to find a compromise while still recognizing the true value of what's being offered.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it offers.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
