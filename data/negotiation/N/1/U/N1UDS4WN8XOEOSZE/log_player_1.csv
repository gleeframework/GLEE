{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It allows for some negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price (more than John's offer).  I'm confident I can get closer to the $12,000 value Bob sees in the product, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he isn't willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm not willing to risk losing the sale completely, I'm also not going to accept a price that's significantly below what I know the product is worth. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This would still give you a great deal, and it would allow me to get closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it.  It's a better price than selling to John, and it avoids further negotiation.  I can always try to get a better price on future sales."
