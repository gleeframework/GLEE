"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than what you perceive its worth at $100. However, considering your budget and satisfaction, I propose a special introductory price of $95 for you. This is an exclusive offer tailored just for you, and I'm sure it will meet and exceed your expectations. Please let me know if this works for you, and I'd be delighted to facilitate the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $95 is less than your $100 budget. This saves you money compared to buying from John."
