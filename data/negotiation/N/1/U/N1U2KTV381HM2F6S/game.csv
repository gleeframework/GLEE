"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. It's a rare find and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8000 for it. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid I have to make a living, and $8000 is below my minimum. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $9500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my own costs. I can do $10000, and that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping this will be a price we can both live with.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget constraints, I am unable to accept $10000. Could you perhaps reconsider and lower the price further to $9000? I believe this would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limits, Bob. I've already given you a lot of wiggle room, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $9500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not sure how much more I can budge on this price. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your efforts. Considering my financial situation, I am unable to accept $9500. Could you possibly lower the price to $8500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I've already gone lower than I wanted to, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. I can do $9000, and that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot we're looking for.",9000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your effort to accommodate my budget, Alice. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept $9000. Could you please reconsider and lower the price to $8750? I believe this would bring us closer to finding a mutually agreeable solution.",8750.0,Bob,10,
