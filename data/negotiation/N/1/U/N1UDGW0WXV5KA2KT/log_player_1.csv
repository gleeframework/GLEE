``` 

This offer starts at a price point higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also frames the price as ""fair"" to subtly influence Bob's perception.  I'm keeping the price high enough to potentially get a better deal than selling to John, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before selling to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I still can't commit to that price. Would it be possible to consider $8,500 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

While $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'll try one more counteroffer before selling to John."

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to go any lower. To ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'll sell to John for $10,000."
