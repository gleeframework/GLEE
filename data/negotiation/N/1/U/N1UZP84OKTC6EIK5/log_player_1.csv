Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing my profit if he counters.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000. This knowledge gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob."
