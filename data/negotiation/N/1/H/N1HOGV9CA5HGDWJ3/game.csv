"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm motivated to sell, $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. Could you do $10,500?  That feels like a reasonable compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, You're clearly interested in this product and I want to find a way for us to agree. How about we push a little past the middle and do $10,100? I'm confident you won't be disappointed with this investment.",10100.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $10,100 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $9,900 and we have a deal?",9900.0,Bob,6,
