"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life.",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $155. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $155. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you consider that price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $140. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130, but I was thinking if you could meet me at $125, I'd be happy to make a deal. Can you consider that price?",125.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $135, Alice, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere. Can you consider meeting me at $130?",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think this is the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at $135, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm still willing to sell the product to you, but I need to think about my next move.",135.0,Alice,9,
