"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $600,000 is simply too low. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $700,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to lower my price to $800,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. It's a fair price considering the value of this product and your perceived worth. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
