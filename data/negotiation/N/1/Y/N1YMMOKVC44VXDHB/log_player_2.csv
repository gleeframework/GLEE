Round 7
Alice's offer:

At this point, Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also a firm bottom line.  Waiting longer might push her away from the deal, and while there's room to haggle, the difference is getting smaller. It's better to secure a good price now than risk losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price."
