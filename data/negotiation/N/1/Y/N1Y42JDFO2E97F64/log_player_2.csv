"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. I know it's worth that much to you, and it's a fair price considering the value it holds.  Let me know if you're interested!  If not, I'll be selling it to John for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to bluff you. She claims she'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000 if you refuse, but you know that's the exact price John is willing to sell it to you for. This suggests she's trying to inflate the price. By rejecting her offer, you call her bluff and can potentially negotiate a lower price or stick with buying from John at your preferred price."
