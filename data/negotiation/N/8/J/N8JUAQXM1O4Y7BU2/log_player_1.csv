Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, Bob values it higher at $1,500,000.  We want to capture as much of that value difference as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential $100,000 gain, a strong incentive for him to accept. This price also gives Alice a significant profit above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong starting point, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially leading to an even higher final price."
