"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$12,000 is still too high:**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $12,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **There's time for counteroffers:** You have 10 rounds, so there's no need to rush into a deal at this price.
* **John is a backup:** Knowing John will sell for $15,000 gives you leverage during the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, showing your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Midpoint Approach:** It's a good starting point, roughly halfway between Alice's price and your desired price. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counter with a price closer to her $8,000 value without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging much:**  Her counteroffer of $13,000 is only a slight decrease from her initial price, suggesting she's not very motivated to make a significant concession.
* **John is still a better option:** While $13,000 is lower than John's price, it's still above your desired price. You have time and the option to buy from John, so there's no reason to rush into this deal. 
* **Further negotiation is likely:**  You can continue to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Increase:** This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Testing the Waters:** It allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility without going too far below her likely bottom line.
* **Staying within Your Budget:** $10,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's price and well within your budget.

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. You're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're not willing to overpay. By gradually increasing your offer, you hope to push Alice closer to your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is inflexible:** Alice's counteroffer is again a small decrease, suggesting she's unwilling to budge significantly. 
* **John remains a viable option:**  $13,500 is still a considerable amount of money, and John's price remains an acceptable alternative.
* **Time to push for a better deal:** You have five rounds left, enough time to continue negotiating and possibly secure a better price.

By rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations, you maintain the pressure on Alice.  This could lead to a more favorable deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Increase:**  This counteroffer is a $1000 increase from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price.
* **Testing Alice's Limits:**  This offer is approaching Alice's likely bottom line, so it will test her willingness to negotiate further.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You still have John as a backup option, so you don't need to rush into a deal at this point.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to push Alice closer to your desired price. By gradually increasing your offer, you're hoping to find a point where Alice is willing to accept.  You're also trying to understand her limits and if she is willing to make a significant concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is holding firm:**  Alice's counteroffer is $14,000, only $1,000 lower than John's price. This suggests she's not likely to budge significantly further.
* **Time is running out:** You have only three rounds left, and there's a high chance you won't reach a better price with Alice.
* **John is a guaranteed deal:** Buying from John guarantees you the product for a price that's only $1,000 higher than Alice's latest offer.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is not worth the potential savings.

**Strategy:**  It's better to secure the product now from John rather than risk losing the opportunity and ending up paying more in the final rounds."
