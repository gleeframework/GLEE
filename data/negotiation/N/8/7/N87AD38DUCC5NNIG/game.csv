"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is too low, I'm willing to move from my initial price.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $850,000, but that's my absolute limit.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $850,000 is still below what I envisioned, I understand the importance of finding a fair deal. Let's try $975,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget.",975000.0,Alice,5,
