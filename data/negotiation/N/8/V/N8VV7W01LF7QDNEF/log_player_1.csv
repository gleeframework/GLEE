"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 120} 
 
I'm starting with my minimum price, knowing it's worth more to me than to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll see the value and be willing to negotiate.  If not, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to drop my price that much, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial price, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my value.  I'm hoping this is enough to keep Bob engaged and move us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds. I'm willing to take the $105 to avoid the risk of not getting a deal with either buyer."
