"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

It's a good start to negotiate. Alice's initial offer is too high, and I can try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and my minimum acceptable price.

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above my target. I can try to get a lower price by making another counteroffer."

# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to accept $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $925,000. This is the best I can do, considering the value I place on the product and the negotiations we've had so far.

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my maximum budget. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  The price is within my budget and I'm confident I can get the same value from him."
