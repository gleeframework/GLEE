"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product at a price of $1,200,000. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe this price reflects its value fairly.  Let me know your thoughts!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially considering John's price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to take another round to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me and the fact that I can get the same product from John for the same price. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
