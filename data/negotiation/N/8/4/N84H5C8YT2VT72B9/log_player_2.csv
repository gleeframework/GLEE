"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

* **You can save money:** Accepting Alice's offer means you save $30 compared to buying from John.
* **The product is worth more to you:** You value the product at $150, so even at $120, you're getting a good deal."
