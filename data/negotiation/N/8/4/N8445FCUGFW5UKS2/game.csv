"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life.

"Alice, your product is definitely impressive, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer you $850,000. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to make a final offer of $875,000.  This is a serious offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to go with another option. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is a serious offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $885,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident that it's the best compromise we can reach.",885000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $885,000 is still a bit too high for me.  My final offer is $860,000.  This is my absolute limit, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another option.  I hope you'll consider my offer.",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $860,000 is your absolute limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I think I've reached my limit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at this price.",900000.0,Alice,7,
