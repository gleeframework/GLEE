Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's likely to be rejected outright. I'm hoping to get a good negotiation going and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering with $16,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable price than my initial offer, hopefully leading to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's last offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I hope this will convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems stubborn and is unlikely to budge much further.  While $14,500 is a decent price, it's not worth continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is a safe and sure option."
