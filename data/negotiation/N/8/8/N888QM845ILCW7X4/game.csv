,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $90? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again, though. How about we meet at $85? It's a bit above your offer, but still a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $80 is your limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's value. How about we settle on $82? It's a fair price considering the product's worth, and I think it's a good compromise.",82.0,Alice,7,
