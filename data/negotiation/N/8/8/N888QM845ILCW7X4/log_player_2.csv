Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is your limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's value. How about we settle on $82? It's a fair price considering the product's worth, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go lower than $82.  You've reached your limit, and John offers a guaranteed price of $80. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
