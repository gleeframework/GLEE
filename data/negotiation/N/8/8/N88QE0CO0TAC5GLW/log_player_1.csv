"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

**Strategy:** I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value, and if not, get a sense of his counteroffer range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob is clearly trying to lowball, there's still potential for negotiation.  He's shown interest, and  I want to explore if we can find a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a solid option, but I'd prefer to try and get closer to my desired price with Bob if possible.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial offer, but still acknowledging Bob's concerns."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $13,000? This gives us both a good deal, and it's still well below my initial offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards the Middle:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Flexibility:** I emphasize my willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Appealing to Mutual Benefit:** I frame the offer as a good deal for both of us.

**Strategy:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my price point. If he isn't, I'll have to reassess whether selling to John is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for moving closer.  $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Enough:** While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to reach a price closer to my desired $15,000.
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:** Although selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first.

**Next Steps:**  I will make a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, but still tries to bridge the gap towards my ideal price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate you coming up to $10,500.  To make this work for me, I'd need to be at $12,000. It's a fair compromise, and we're getting closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm offering $12,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500.
* **Highlighting Progress:** I emphasize that we are making progress towards an agreement.
* **Urgency (Implicit):** The offer implies a sense of urgency, suggesting that I may not be willing to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**  I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair compromise. If he rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we are definitely getting closer! I'm willing to go up a bit, but $12,000 is still a stretch. How about $11,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Final Offer is a Bluff:** Bob's ""final offer"" is likely a tactic to get me to accept, but I'm not convinced it's truly his limit.
* **Possible to Bridge the Gap:** There's still potential to bridge the gap further.  

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my ideal price. I'll also emphasize my willingness to negotiate to find a mutually acceptable solution."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to move closer.  To make this work for both of us, I'd need to be at $11,500. It's a small difference, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm increasing the price by only $500, showing a genuine desire to reach a deal.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing it as a small concession on both sides, emphasizing the win-win aspect.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm creating a sense of urgency, suggesting that this might be my final offer.

**Strategy:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer as a compromise, but if not, I'll need to re-evaluate my options and consider selling to John."
