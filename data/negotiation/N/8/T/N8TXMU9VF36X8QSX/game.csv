"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $120? I'm really interested in getting it.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a little too high for me.  How about we settle at $125?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob! I understand that $125 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",130.0,Alice,5,
