"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product that will meet your needs. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Given our previous discussions and my budget, I'm willing to offer $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though - I'll throw in a free premium service package worth $500. This will sweeten the deal and make it more attractive to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
