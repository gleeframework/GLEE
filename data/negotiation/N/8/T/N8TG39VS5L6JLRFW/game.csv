"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to secure a good return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to get a good deal. Can you meet me in the middle at $800,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $825,000 for the product. This allows you to get a good deal while ensuring I receive a fair price.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $775,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to an agreement. While I appreciate your offer of $775,000, I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we compromise at $800,000? That way, we both get a fair deal and can move forward with the transaction. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
