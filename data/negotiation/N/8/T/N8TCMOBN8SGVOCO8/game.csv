"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
