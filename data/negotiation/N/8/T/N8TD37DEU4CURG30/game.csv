"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to secure the product within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better price elsewhere.",11500.0,Alice,3,
