,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's try $100 as a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we meet at $125? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your persistence, $125 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited to $100.  Is there any way we can make this work?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. How about we meet at $115? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for the product's quality.",115.0,Alice,7,
