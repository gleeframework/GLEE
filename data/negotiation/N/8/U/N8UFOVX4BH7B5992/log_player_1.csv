"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate, but still shows that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I think $95 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $95 is better than $80, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is my lowest price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'm also reiterating my willingness to negotiate, which hopefully will encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $105, $100 is still a good price for me, especially considering I'm already halfway through the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to settle for the lower price from John."
