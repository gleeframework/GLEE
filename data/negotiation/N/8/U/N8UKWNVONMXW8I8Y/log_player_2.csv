While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get it lower. I have some room to negotiate with Alice, and I'm confident I can get the price down to something more acceptable."

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to come down to my maximum price of $10,000.  It seems like we're stuck in a stalemate, and I don't want to waste any more time negotiating.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $10,000, as it's the best option available to me at this point."
