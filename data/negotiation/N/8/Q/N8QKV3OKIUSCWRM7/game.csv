,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe the product has great potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your perspective.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the inherent worth of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,350,000. I'm confident that this price reflects a fair value for the product, and I'm eager to move forward with the purchase.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000, but that's as low as I can go. This offer reflects the significant value the product brings and leaves little room for further negotiation.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final push, but I'd like to propose $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one last time.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
