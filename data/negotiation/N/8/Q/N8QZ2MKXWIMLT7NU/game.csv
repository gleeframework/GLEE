"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $7,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $8,200? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think!",8200.0,Alice,5,
