"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable price. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point.  Even though Bob knows his valuation is lower, your initial price can influence his perception of a ""fair"" price.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:**  Starting high allows you to make concessions in later rounds, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and increase his willingness to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is his initial valuation, which we expected. It leaves no room for negotiation. We have plenty of rounds left, and selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price.  We'll reject Bob's offer to signal we're looking for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the quality of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** We're making a significant concession from $18,000 to $15,000 to show Bob we're willing to negotiate. However, we're justifying the price by emphasizing the product's value.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This common negotiation tactic can be persuasive. While it's not truly the middle ground (that would be $14,000), it creates an illusion of fairness and compromise. 
* **Aiming Above Our Minimum:** We're still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving us more room for future negotiations if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting this offer ensures we get our minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
