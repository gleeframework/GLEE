"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This would still leave you a significant profit and be a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves significant room for profit on your end. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
