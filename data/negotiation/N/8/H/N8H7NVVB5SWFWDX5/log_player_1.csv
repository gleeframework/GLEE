**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a price point where:
    * Bob makes a $150,000 gain ($1,000,000 value - $1,150,000 price).
    * I make a $150,000 profit above my minimum. 
* **Urgency & Exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, I create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly."
