"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of your product, $2000000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000,  which reflects the value I see in this product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of that, I would like to propose a more flexible deal. How about we consider a payment plan over 12 months? The total amount remains at $2000000, but it would be spread out to make it more manageable for your budget. This way, you can start benefiting from the product immediately while paying it off over time. Please let me know if this option suits you better.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the payment plan offer, but it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1700000 upfront for the product. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Please let me know if you're open to this compromise.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
