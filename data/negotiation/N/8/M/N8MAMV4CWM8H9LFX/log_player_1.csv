Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from the $1,000,000 he's willing to pay, while still getting you a price well above your minimum of $800,000. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, but it's a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still lower than the initial offer I made. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob, especially since he's already shown his willingness to pay close to my initial offer. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm going to split the difference with Bob's counteroffer. $925,000 is still a good price for me, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise while also remaining firm in my belief that the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is only $500 more than his previous offer, I'm still not happy with it.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price, so I'm going to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 912500} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway again.  $912,500 is a good compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to budge much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge much further, and I've already made several concessions. While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, it's becoming clear that we're at an impasse.  Selling to John ensures I get a decent price, and I can move on to other potential buyers."
