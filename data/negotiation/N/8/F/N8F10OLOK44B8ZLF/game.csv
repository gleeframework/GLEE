"Bob, I have a product here that I think could be of great value to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to let you have it for $1500000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product. I understand its significance to you, but my valuation for this product is capped at $800000. I hope we can reach an agreement that respects both our interests.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my assessment, I am unable to meet your price of $1200000. My maximum budget remains at $800000. Would you consider coming down further?",800000.0,Bob,4,
