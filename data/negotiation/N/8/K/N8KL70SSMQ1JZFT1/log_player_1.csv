"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price from either Bob or John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $780,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer of $780,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. John's offer is a safe bet, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob."
