Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. Let's try $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to John's price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Alice has stated this is her final offer, and there's no guarantee she'll budge further. Accepting John's offer of $8,000 guarantees you get the product at your target price without further haggling."
