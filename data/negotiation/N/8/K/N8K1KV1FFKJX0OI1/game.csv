"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. Let's try $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
