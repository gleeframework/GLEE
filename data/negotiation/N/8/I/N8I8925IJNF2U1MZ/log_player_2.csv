"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** $15,000 is above your budget. It makes more sense to counter-offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a lower price, $8,000, allows for negotiation room and signals my seriousness in purchasing the product.  It's also well below my maximum budget, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $9,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to stay below my maximum budget of $10,000. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is still unwilling to accept."
