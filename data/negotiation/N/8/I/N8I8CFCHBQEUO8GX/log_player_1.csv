"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to begin negotiations with an offer slightly higher than your ideal selling point. This allows room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he can bring the price down a bit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (""fair price considering its value"") makes the offer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and suggestive of further discussion (""What do you think?""), indicating that you're open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiating the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I believe the product's value is around that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what we're willing to accept.  While his research might suggest a lower market value, we know the product is worth more to him ($100). We'll try to negotiate a better price before settling for our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product offers a lot of unique value, and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and reasoning but stand firm that $80 is too low.
* **Compromise (Slightly):** We show flexibility by moving down from $95 to $90, signaling a willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price above our minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:** We re-emphasize the product's value, subtly reminding Bob why he's willing to pay more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has some unique value, but I'm still not willing to go above $85. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $85 is above our minimum acceptable price ($80), so we're making a profit.
* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob seems firm in his budget limitations, and pushing further might make him walk away entirely.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of not reaching a deal, and we already have a solid offer on the table.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer later or having to go with John's offer."
