{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $9,500 is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still lower than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially go lower if Bob counters, giving you the flexibility to get closer to your desired price. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  It demonstrates that you're open to finding a solution that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is close to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $9,250?  I think this price is fair, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $9,100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my $10,000 goal, Bob's offer of $9,100 is very close.  It's still above my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to go back to John, who may not be available later."
