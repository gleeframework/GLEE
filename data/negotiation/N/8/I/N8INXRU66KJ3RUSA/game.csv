"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $15500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $15500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $15000. I've gone as low as I can, and I hope you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",15000.0,Bob,6,
