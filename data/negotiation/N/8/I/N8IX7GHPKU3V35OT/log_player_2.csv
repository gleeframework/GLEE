Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you at $760,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $760,000 is still higher than my target price of $750,000, Alice has indicated that she won't go lower. I'm also concerned that we're running out of time.  If I keep rejecting her offers, we might not reach an agreement, and I'll have to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's better to accept Alice's offer and get the product at a slightly higher price than risk losing the deal entirely."
