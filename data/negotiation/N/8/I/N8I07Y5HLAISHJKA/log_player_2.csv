{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer is above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. He's aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $10,000.  This is a bold move, but if Alice is truly interested in selling, she might be willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially increasing the price again is high. Accepting the offer saves him time and ensures he gets the product without exceeding his maximum budget."
