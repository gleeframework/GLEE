Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'll give you one last chance to meet me at a price I'm comfortable with. I'll sell it to you for $92. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $90.  While we could continue negotiating, we risk her raising the price or the negotiations falling apart. Buying from John for $120 guarantees we get the product and stay within our budget."
