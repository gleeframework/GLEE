Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap through negotiation tactics.

**Negotiation Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the stated values, you need to either:

1. **Convince Bob the product is worth more:** Highlight features or benefits he might not be fully considering. 
2. **Accept a price below your minimum:** Risky, as you'd be losing money compared to selling to John. Only viable if you *really* need a quick sale.

**The Offer**

Given the information, the strongest approach is to aim high and then be open to negotiation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let's discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Confident Opening:** Starting high shows you value the product and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:**  Highlighting the product's benefits might shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Open to Discussion:**  ""Let's discuss further"" signals flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Counter-Offer:** Be prepared for Bob to reject your initial offer.  Analyze his counter-offer to understand his true willingness to pay.
* **Your Walk-Away Point:** Remember, you have John as a backup. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet a price that's acceptable to you."
