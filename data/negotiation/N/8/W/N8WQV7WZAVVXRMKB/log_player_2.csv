"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $100 for the product, and John is selling it for $100, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John."
