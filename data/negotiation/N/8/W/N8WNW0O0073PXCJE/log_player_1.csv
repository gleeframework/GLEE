Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm aiming higher and believe we can find a price that benefits both of us.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

While $1,250,000 is tempting, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll counter in the next round to try and close the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and would like to suggest a price of $1,275,000. I believe this strikes a balance between the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

While I'd ideally like to get more, Bob is clearly set on a price around this range. Accepting $1,275,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
