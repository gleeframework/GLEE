"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value you'll gain from the product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we discuss further?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal that respects both our needs. If you're still interested, let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so I'm going to go down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
