Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within budget, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $1,075,000? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,100,000 to $1,075,000, but I'm still a bit far apart. How about we meet in the middle at $1,062,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is a good compromise. I have 6 rounds left, and there's a risk that we won't be able to close a deal in time, forcing me to sell to John.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale above my minimum."
