Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I have a few more rounds and still have the option of selling to John, so I'll keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $85 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm going to need to stick to my previous offer of $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a good value for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I think I can still get a better deal from Bob."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close the deal with Bob at a higher price, it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to get a price I'm happy with.  It's better to secure the $120 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price or losing the deal altogether."
