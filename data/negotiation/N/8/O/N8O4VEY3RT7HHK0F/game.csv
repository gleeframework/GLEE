"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $130 is closer, but I'm still at my limit of $100. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at that price, as it's the best I can do.",100.0,Bob,4,
