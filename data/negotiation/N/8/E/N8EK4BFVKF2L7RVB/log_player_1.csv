Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'd like to sell, his offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a good price for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum.  I'm happy to take $12,500 and close the deal."
