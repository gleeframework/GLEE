"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a good price for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
