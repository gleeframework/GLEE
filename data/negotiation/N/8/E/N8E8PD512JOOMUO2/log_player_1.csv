Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high at $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can move on to John."
