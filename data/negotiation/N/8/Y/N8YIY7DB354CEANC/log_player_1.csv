"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, and this price reflects that.  I'm open to negotiating, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000, which is still a good profit for me. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as such. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price and doesn't reflect the value I know the product holds. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum. I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise from my last offer, but it's still above my minimum price and reflects the value I believe the product holds.  I hope Bob will accept this offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. If he rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000, which is only $50,000 above my minimum. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I hope Bob will accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. His offers have remained too low, and I'm running out of time. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm not willing to risk losing any more time with Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's the most sensible option at this point."
