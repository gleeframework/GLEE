"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to sell for $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to your maximum price point.  It's a fair deal considering John would also sell for that price. Accepting avoids the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the product entirely."
