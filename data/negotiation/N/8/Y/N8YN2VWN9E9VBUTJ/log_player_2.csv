Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as high as $11,500. I'm willing to make one final concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're not interested, I'd be happy to discuss other options with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $13,500.  Continuing the negotiation is risky, as you might end up with a price higher than John's offer."
