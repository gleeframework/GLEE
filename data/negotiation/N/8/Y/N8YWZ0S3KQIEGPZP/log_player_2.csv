"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice for $120 when you can get it from John for $80.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the chance to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm starting with my maximum price, $80, as that's what I'm willing to pay.  If Alice accepts, great! If not, we can negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. I'll keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm willing to go up to $90, which is still a good deal for me and might be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going up slightly to $95. This should show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to go any higher.  We're getting close, so hopefully she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is now offering the product at $100, which is her minimum. While this is closer to my desired price, I've already used 6 rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk going further. I'm going to buy the product from John for $80. It's a sure thing and gets me the product at a price I'm happy with."
