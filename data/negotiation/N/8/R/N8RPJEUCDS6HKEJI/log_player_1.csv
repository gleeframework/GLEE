Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming for a significant profit, so I'm starting with a high offer.
* **Fairness:**  I'm acknowledging the product's value to Bob, but not giving it away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation,  anticipating that Bob will likely counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have a backup buyer at $800,000 gives me leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000, and his offer is still lower than that. 
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** I believe Bob will be willing to increase his offer if I reject his initial counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps my leverage in the negotiation. He's clearly interested, and I'm in a strong position to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but not drastically.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not taking a significant loss.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing finding a solution that benefits both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is $200,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob seems willing to pay close to my minimum.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, or I might not be able to get a better offer in future rounds. 
* **Secure a Profit:** Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's in my best interest to secure this deal and ensure a positive outcome."
