Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm going to start high, at $1,750,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it also ensures I get a significant portion of the value I place on the product. I believe this is a fair starting point given the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's well below my minimum acceptable price, and it's also closer to my initial offer, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk dropping the price too far. I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will pay my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure a sale with John and avoid further haggling with Bob."
