Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but also ensures I'm getting significantly more than my minimum value.  I'm confident this product is worth more than $1,500,000 to Bob, but I'm open to his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to maximize my profit, I'm not desperate to sell.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows good faith and opens the possibility of reaching an agreement. I believe this price is fair considering Bob's initial counteroffer and the value of the product."

Bob is being stubborn and unwilling to budge.  I'm not going to waste more time trying to negotiate with him. I'll accept John's offer of $1,500,000. It's not ideal, but it's still a good profit and ensures I'm not losing out."
