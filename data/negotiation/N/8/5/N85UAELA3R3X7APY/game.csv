"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the comprehensive warranty and free delivery. However, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I believe it's a fair offer considering the market value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. I am unable to accept $9,000 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway at $10,500? This still allows us to cover our costs while providing you with a competitive price in the market.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $9,750? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've reviewed your latest offer and appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $9,900 for the product. This allows us to cover our costs while still being competitive in the market. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",9900.0,Alice,5,
