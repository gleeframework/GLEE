"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the value I've researched.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get closer to the value you've researched, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $8500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $8000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000. Can you consider this offer?",8000.0,Bob,4,
