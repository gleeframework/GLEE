Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you at $82, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $82.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
