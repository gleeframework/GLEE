"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8750? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $9000. How about we try to find a compromise? I'll sell the product to you for $9100. It's a slight concession, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9050 is closer, I'm still just a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8900, and I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering our previous offers.  Let's try to close this deal.",8900.0,Bob,8,
