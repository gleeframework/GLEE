Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to offer $850,000 as a starting point.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise, and hopefully a good starting point for a final agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
