"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 represents the product's significant value, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we consider $1,275,000?  This reflects my effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,275,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
