"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is at least $8,000 to you, and I would like to propose a price closer to that value. How about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $9,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price.  How about $8,750?  This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get the product for a price you're comfortable with and me to get a bit closer to what I'm hoping for."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I've given this some more thought, and I'd like to propose $8,600 as a counteroffer. This is a price that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,600 is only $100 less than my previous counteroffer, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  It's not worth risking the deal to get an extra $100, so I'll accept."
