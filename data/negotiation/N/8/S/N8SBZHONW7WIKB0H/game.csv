"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my range. I'm very interested in this product and believe its value to me is around $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
