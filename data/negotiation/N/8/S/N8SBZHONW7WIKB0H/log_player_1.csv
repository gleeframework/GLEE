Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my range. I'm very interested in this product and believe its value to me is around $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move significantly higher than his $1,100,000 offer. Accepting a lower offer is not in my best interest when I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000."
