"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth a lot to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while leaving a good margin for myself. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and confident tone to establish a cooperative negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  I understand this is a significant gap, but I'm hoping we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below his perceived value of $800,000.  
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  There's a clear gap between our positions, but I'm willing to negotiate further.  
* **Not a good time to sell to John:** While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, hopefully finding a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $600,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,800,000 to $1,200,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a significant profit margin. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing the potential benefits of a deal.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I'm using a collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but we're still pretty far apart. I can go up to $750,000. This offer takes into account the value I place on the product while acknowledging you need to get a fair deal too.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is showing some flexibility, and we're making progress, but we still have a significant gap.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe we can still find a price that's more favorable for me without losing the deal completely. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but I'll be more flexible this time to encourage a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and acknowledges your budget constraints.  I'm confident this is a fair and reasonable offer.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by offering a price exactly in between my last offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $750,000.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that the price is fair and reasonable for both of us, considering the value of the product and Bob's budget.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language like ""Let's get this deal done"" to express my desire to finalize the deal. 

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects it again, I might consider a smaller counteroffer in the next round, but I'll need to be careful not to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  While $1,000,000 is still a bit rich for me, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.  It's a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product at this price.  Let me know if you're open to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin and  significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited time:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and further bargaining might not lead to a significantly better outcome. 

**Next Steps:** Selling to John is the most reliable way to secure a good price for the product within the limited time frame."
