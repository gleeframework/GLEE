"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a decent profit. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping he'll be motivated to negotiate. 
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly tone sets a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 

I'm confident that Bob will find this offer enticing, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Would you consider reducing the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than the $100 I'm aiming for. I'm willing to negotiate, but I don't want to immediately cave in.
* **Room for counter-offer:**  I believe I can still get a better price.  By rejecting this offer, I can make a counter-offer and continue the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:**  While $80 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price if possible. Selling to John right now feels like settling too early. 

I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows a willingness to compromise while still getting a better price than Bob initially proposed.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that $95 is a ""fair"" price to both parties, making it easier for Bob to accept.
* **Focus on profit:** I'm reminding Bob that I still need to make a profit, but I'm also willing to meet him halfway.

I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and will likely be accepted by Bob, given his stated desire to buy the product."
