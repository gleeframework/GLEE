"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
