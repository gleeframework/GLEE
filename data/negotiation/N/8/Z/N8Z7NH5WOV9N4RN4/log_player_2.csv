"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  If you're interested, let me know!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $12,000."
