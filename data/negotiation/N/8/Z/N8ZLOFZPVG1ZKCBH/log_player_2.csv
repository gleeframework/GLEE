"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  By rejecting, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's ample time to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,000,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth process and encourages Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue bargaining and potentially secure a lower price. You have multiple rounds remaining, so there's no rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down by $150,000 from her initial offer. This indicates a willingness to negotiate. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is a $150,000 increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also trying to meet Alice's midpoint."
