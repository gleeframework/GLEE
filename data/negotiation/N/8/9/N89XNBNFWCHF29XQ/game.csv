"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to $100 as possible. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $90 is a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
