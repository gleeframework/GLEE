Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking for something closer to $80. I understand the value of the product is higher for you, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to get $80,  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than $80, as the product is worth $150 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  $80 is simply too low for me, considering the value of the product to you. Let's try $100. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $100 is a step in the right direction, I still feel that we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $90? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while also acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $90 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and still provides a good profit for me. I'd rather close the deal with Bob than risk losing him and selling to John for a lower price."
