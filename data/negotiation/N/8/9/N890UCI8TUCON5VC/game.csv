,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking for something closer to $80. I understand the value of the product is higher for you, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  $80 is simply too low for me, considering the value of the product to you. Let's try $100. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $100 is a step in the right direction, I still feel that we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $90? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while also acknowledging the value of the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
