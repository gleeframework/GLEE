"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value.  I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the message positively, highlighting the product's value and using friendly language. 
* **Open-ended Question:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  
* **Potential for Improvement:** There's room to negotiate further.  I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John for $150 is my best-case scenario, but rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore better options and maintain control of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is simply too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $115?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that I'm offering him a good deal, even at the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $95 is still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not desperate to sell at this price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your efforts. However, $95 is still a little low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $105.  This is my final offer, let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making this a ""final offer"" to signal that I'm close to my limit and create a sense of urgency.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's last offer ($95).
* **Positive and Firm:** The message is positive but firm, indicating that I'm not willing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I'm willing to pay $97 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $97 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I have a better option with John, so I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $97, but it's still a bit too low.  To be honest, I'm considering selling this to someone else who's offering me a much better price. However, I like doing business with you. If you can come up just a little to $100, I'm willing to make this deal happen. It's a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Playing the ""Almost Sold"" Card:** I'm introducing the idea that I have another buyer to increase the pressure and make Bob more likely to increase his offer.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Win-Win Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Limited Time:** This is a risky move, but if Bob is really interested, he might be willing to meet me at $100 to avoid losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad you're considering my offer. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are now in round 8, nearing the end of the negotiation window.
* **Below Minimum:** $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Better Option:**  John is a guaranteed sale at $150, making him the better choice. 
* **No Significant Progress:** Bob's offers have been incrementally increasing, but they haven't reached a point where it's worthwhile for me to continue the negotiation.

With only two rounds remaining, the potential gain from continuing to negotiate with Bob is not worth the risk of potentially failing to reach an agreement.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum requirements."
