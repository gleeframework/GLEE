**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the product's value to her. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, I can attempt to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I agree it has potential. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my ideal price. I'm confident I can get it down further. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,250. This is as low as I can go without losing profit. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,250, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $11,000. This is a good deal for me as I can get the product for $11,250, which is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John is higher than the potential savings."
