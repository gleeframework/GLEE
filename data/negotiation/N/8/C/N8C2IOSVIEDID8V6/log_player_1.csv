Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum value and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's also a firm price that reflects the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and it's getting progressively lower.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear that Bob is not going to meet my minimum value.  Therefore, I will sell to John for $1,200,000."
