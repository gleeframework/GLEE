"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a good starting point, as it's a fair price for both of us. It's above my minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. It's a compromise between my last offer and Bob's, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly higher than my minimum, it's still a good deal and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. It's better to close the deal now than risk getting a lower price from John or running out of rounds."
