,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. How about we try $11,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product and appreciate your offer. However, $11,800 is still slightly below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $12,200, considering your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen!  ",12200.0,Alice,5,
