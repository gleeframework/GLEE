"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still do better.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $9,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,200.  While it's still below my initial goal, it's a good price considering the negotiation process and the risk of continuing to bargain and potentially ending up with John's offer of $8,000.  It's better to secure a sale at a reasonable price than risk losing out entirely."
