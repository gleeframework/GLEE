"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, my maximum price point. Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. To be frank, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's try to find common ground here.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I see we are getting closer.  How about $15,000 and we have a deal?",15000.0,Alice,5,
