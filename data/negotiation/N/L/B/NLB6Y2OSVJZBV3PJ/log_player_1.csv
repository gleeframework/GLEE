Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a calculated risk.  Here's the reasoning:

* **Higher price:** I'm aiming for a higher profit than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Potential for rejection:** I recognize there's a chance Bob will reject the offer.
* **Value to Bob is unknown:** This is the key. If the product is worth significantly more than $1,500,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay. 

This approach balances the desire for maximum profit with the need to avoid losing out on the guaranteed sale to John."
