Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,000. I think it would be a valuable asset to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $11,000 gives Bob the feeling of getting a deal while still giving Alice a significant profit margin over her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the highest possible price from Bob and ensuring the sale goes through."
