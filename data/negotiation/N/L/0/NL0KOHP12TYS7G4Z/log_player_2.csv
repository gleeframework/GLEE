"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high, and he has plenty of rounds left to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  While $11,500 is closer to his desired price, he can likely get it lower with more negotiation. He has plenty of rounds left to explore."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $10,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $11,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. $11,000 is still too high for him, and he has several rounds left to try and negotiate a lower price. He is still better off rejecting and attempting to get a lower price than accepting and paying more than he'd like."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm trying to be fair here, but $11,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $10,750. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,750 is getting closer to his desired price, he can likely get it lower with more negotiation. He still has several rounds left to explore, and a better deal might be within reach."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up to $10,600, but that's my absolute final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,600.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  He's very close to his desired price, and with only one round left, it's unlikely he'll be able to get a lower price. Accepting Alice's offer of $10,700 is the best option for Bob in this situation."
