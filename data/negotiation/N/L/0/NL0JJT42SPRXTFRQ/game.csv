"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit out of my price range.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?  I'm sure we can work something out.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for 100, which is the lowest price I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know if that works for you!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's the absolute most I can do.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of 90, but I was really hoping to get closer to my original price. I can offer you a compromise at 95. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product!",95.0,Alice,5,
