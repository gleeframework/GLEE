"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to recover a significant portion of your value while still providing me with a great deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price that still allows you to benefit from the purchase while also reflecting the product's worth to me. What are your thoughts?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Given our previous discussions and the value I place on this product, I'm offering $9,250. This price reflects a good compromise, allowing me to purchase the item within my budget while still offering you a fair return on your investment. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,250 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. Considering the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
