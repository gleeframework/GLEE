Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to recover a significant portion of your value while still providing me with a great deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Given our previous discussions and the value I place on this product, I'm offering $9,250. This price reflects a good compromise, allowing me to purchase the item within my budget while still offering you a fair return on your investment. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.
