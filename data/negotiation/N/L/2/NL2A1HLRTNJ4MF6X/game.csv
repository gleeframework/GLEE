"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $700,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest closer to $650,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value and market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $675,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
