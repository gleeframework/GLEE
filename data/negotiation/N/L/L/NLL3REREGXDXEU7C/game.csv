"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $12,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is just a little too low for me.  How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and a good step towards a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? I think we're getting close to a deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
