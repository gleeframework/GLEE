# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds immense value for me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am eager to share it. Given its significance and quality, I propose a purchase price of $1,200,000. This offer is designed to be mutually beneficial, ensuring you receive a valuable asset while allowing me to maximize the return on my investment. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal. Kind regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than John's price of $1,500,000. However, you know the product is worth significantly less to Alice ($800,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, potentially closer to her actual valuation."
