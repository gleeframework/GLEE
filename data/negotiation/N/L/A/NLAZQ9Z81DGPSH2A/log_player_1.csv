Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'd accept, giving Bob some room to negotiate but still leaving myself room to make a profit. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a good negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, but I'm not ready to walk away yet.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to what I want."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
