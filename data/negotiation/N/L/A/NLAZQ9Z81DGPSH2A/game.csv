"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
