"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $80. I'm happy to accept this offer and finalize the deal."
