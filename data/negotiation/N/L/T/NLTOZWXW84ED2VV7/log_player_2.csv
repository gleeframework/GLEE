"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $120 to me. Considering its worth to you is $100, I propose we strike a deal that respects both our interests. Would you be open to purchasing the product for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is a fair attempt to find a middle ground, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  There's no reason to pay more than your maximum price."
