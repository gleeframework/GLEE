Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** John offers a safety net at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim higher than $800,000 with Bob since you have a guaranteed buyer. However, you don't want to go so high that Bob walks away.  A reasonable strategy is to start with a price that gives you a significant profit but leaves room for negotiation.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's polite, professional, and highlights the product's value.
* **The Price:** $950,000 gives you a strong profit margin.
* **Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price a little high. Remember, your goal is to maximize profit, so be prepared to negotiate down slightly if needed. 

**Important Note:**  While John offers a safety net, a successful negotiation with Bob is ideal as it avoids potential delays and ensures a quicker sale."
