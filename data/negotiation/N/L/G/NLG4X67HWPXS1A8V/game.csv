"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
