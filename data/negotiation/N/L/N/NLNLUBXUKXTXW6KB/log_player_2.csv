Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, however,  $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its value while still being a good deal for you.
