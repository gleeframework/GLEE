"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $950,000. That's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to pay $925,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000",925000.0,Bob,6,
