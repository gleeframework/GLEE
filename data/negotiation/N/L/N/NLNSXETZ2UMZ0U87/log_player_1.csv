``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a slight incentive to buy, while still leaving room for bargaining. It's also important to be friendly and encouraging in the message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum threshold, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $950,000. That's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to pay $925,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's final offer is still too low for me.  It's better to sell to John for $1,000,000 than to accept Bob's offer and lose out on a significant amount of money."
