I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum, hoping to get a quick deal but still leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counter with a higher price, hoping to find a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is getting too low for my liking, and I'm not sure if we can agree on a price that works for both of us. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John at this point."
