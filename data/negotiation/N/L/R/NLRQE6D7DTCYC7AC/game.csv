"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,100,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects my desire to see this deal go through while acknowledging the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that the product's value doesn't justify the price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $975,000. This amount still respects the product's value while being within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  It seems we're getting closer. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm offering a final price of $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, as I believe it reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. While I respect your efforts, I must decline. My maximum budget remains at $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. If not, I'll proceed to purchase the product from John for $800,000.",950000.0,Bob,6,
