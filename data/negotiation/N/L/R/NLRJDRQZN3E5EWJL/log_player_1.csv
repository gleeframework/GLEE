{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant gain for Bob:** He gets a $100,000 discount.
* **It's a good profit for you:** You earn $400,000 more than your minimum goal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly, but not too much, to encourage a deal. 

Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so don't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still a good profit for you, it's a bit too low. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'm going to try to counter with a price that's still attractive to Bob, but also leaves me with more profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $1,300,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  This would still be a fantastic price for you, and it would let us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,325,000, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my last offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away too much."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go a little lower to meet you halfway, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low. Let's try $1,340,000. That's a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1340000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think we can do better. How about $1,320,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to push for more,  Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is still a good profit for me and getting closer to his limit. There's a risk of him walking away or going to another seller, so I'm going to take this offer and secure the deal."
