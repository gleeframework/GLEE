"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,300,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering both our perspectives on the product's value. Let's see if we can finally agree on a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",1320000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and your willingness to meet me halfway.  How about we settle on $1,310,000? This represents a good compromise for both of us, and it brings us closer to a deal.  Let's make it happen.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
