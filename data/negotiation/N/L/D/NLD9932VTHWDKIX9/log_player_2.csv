"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $12,000 and Alice is selling it for $10,000, saving you $2,000.
* **Rejecting the offer means you'll pay more.** You'd be paying $12,000 from John, which is more than Alice's offer."
