Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm selling. I'm happy to offer it to you for $150.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not ridiculously high. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and potentially see the value in the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By not going straight to my minimum, I'm indicating that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept an offer that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:** Bob's offer is exactly my minimum, meaning I have no room for negotiation.
* **Room for a Counteroffer:** Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup means I'm not pressured into accepting Bob's offer just because it's my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my absolute minimum, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to consider $135?  It's a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Compromise:**  I'm not going straight back to my original price. Instead, I'm offering a compromise, showing flexibility.
* **Justify Counteroffer:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (""fair compromise"") to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encouraging. 
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** $135 still leaves room for more negotiation, but it also puts some pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I really like the product and want to make a deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $5 above my absolute minimum.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffers:** While I could try for another counteroffer, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Rejecting this offer might lead to a lengthy negotiation or even a complete breakdown. 
* **John's Offer:** John is offering my absolute minimum, making Bob's offer slightly better.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision at this point."
