"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than you'd like to pay. There's room for negotiation, and you have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum value. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise. It allows for room to negotiate further in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still higher than what I want to pay. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price and have enough rounds left to do so.  I'll continue to try to get a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and move closer to Alice's offer. However, I'm still below her current offer, leaving room for further negotiation in future rounds. The goal is to find a price that's agreeable to both of us before I have to resort to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and only slightly higher than my ideal price.  At this point, with only five rounds left, it's not worth risking a counteroffer and potentially needing to buy from John at a much higher price. I'm accepting the deal, which allows me to save $10,000 compared to John's offer."
