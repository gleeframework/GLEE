Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was still a bit high, and I appreciate your reference to John's offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I can offer you a compromise at $110. This is the lowest I can go while still making a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However,  $110 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $80, which is the same price John is offering.  This is my final offer."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I've already made concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one last offer to you: $130. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice is not going to come down to a price that's reasonable for you. She's gone back up in price and is still significantly higher than John's offer.  Cut your losses and buy from John."
