"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this high-quality product. I believe you'll really appreciate its value. Would you like to take it home for $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $9,500 is more than Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see the value in this product is worth more than $7,500 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $8,800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm feeling comfortable at $8,200.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,200. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay at a minimum of $8,500. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's final offer of $8,500 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000. It's better to go with John's offer and save the money."
