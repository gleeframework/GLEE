"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see the value in this product is worth more than $7,500 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $8,800?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm feeling comfortable at $8,200.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,200. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay at a minimum of $8,500. This is my final offer for now.",8500.0,Alice,5,
