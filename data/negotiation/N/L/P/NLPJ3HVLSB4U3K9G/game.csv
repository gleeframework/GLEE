"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
