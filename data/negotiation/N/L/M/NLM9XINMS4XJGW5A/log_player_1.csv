"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
Explanation: While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than both my minimum and his perceived value. I'll negotiate further to try and reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $700,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects the true value of the product and represents a significant discount from my initial offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $785,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
