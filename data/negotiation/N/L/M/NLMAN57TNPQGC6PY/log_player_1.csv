"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position, and I want to see if Bob is seriously interested in purchasing the product at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,500,000 meets my minimum, I'm not ready to accept just yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product has value beyond Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum and even lower than his previous offer. I am not willing to sell for that price. I will continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable. I've already made significant compromises, and his current offer is far below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.  I've already wasted several rounds and I'm not confident I'll get a better deal with Bob."
