(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can do better than $950,000. He has a clear advantage in this negotiation since he values the product at $1,200,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is still above Alice's value of $800,000, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is willing to negotiate but also values the product and wants to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is increasing her offer, but it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Since Bob has a clear advantage, he should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  He still has room to negotiate before needing to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer, but still below Alice's current offer. This shows that he's willing to compromise but also wants to get the best price possible. He's trying to meet Alice halfway, hoping to get a deal closer to his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's maximum price. If he rejects this offer, Alice might continue to increase the price, potentially reaching a point where it's no longer beneficial for Bob to negotiate.  Since John is offering a fixed price, it's safer and more predictable to buy from him. Bob has a clear idea of the price and can avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
