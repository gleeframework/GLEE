Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell below $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position. Since John provides a guaranteed sale at your minimum, you can aim for a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping he sees additional value you might not be aware of. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $1,600,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  The offer is above Bob's perceived value but not exorbitantly so. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Have a strategy ready for how low you're willing to go. 
* **Relationship Matters:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might adjust your approach to be less aggressive. 

Remember, this is just one potential strategy.  The best approach will always depend on the specifics of the situation and your negotiation style."
