"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's also a fantastic opportunity for your business. I'm willing to let it go for $900000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  This product has significant value, and I believe it will be worth even more in your hands.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $812500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a great deal and me to get closer to my target.  Let's get this done!",812500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $812500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $785000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",785000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $785000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,7,
