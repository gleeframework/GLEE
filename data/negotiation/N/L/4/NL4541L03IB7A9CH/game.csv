,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my product's value is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This considers both our interests.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $12,750, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is my final offer.",12750.0,Alice,5,
