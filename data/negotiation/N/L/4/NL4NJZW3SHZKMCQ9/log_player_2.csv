"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $60."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 is my ideal price, I could come down to $160 for you.  I think that's a fair offer considering the value this product provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $160 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to consider $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a reasonable price for this. How about we split the difference and say $140? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is not budging much and is still way above your budget. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price you're willing to pay within the remaining rounds.  Cut your losses and buy from John for $80."
