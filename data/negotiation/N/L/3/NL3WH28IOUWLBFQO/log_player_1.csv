Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and my current financial constraints. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits and avoids any further negotiation.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 remains too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. This price acknowledges the product's value while staying within my financial limits. I believe this is a fair compromise and we can finalize the deal without further delays. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my financial limits. I can offer $1,850,000 for the product. This represents a fair and final price that reflects both the value of the product and my financial constraints. If we can agree on this, we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
