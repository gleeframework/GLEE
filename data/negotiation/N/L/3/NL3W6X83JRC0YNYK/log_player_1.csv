{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially move closer to my desired price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,200 is a good offer, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,200, which would be $8,600. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,600 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough for me to accept. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $8,600 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800 as a final offer. This is my absolute minimum, so I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm lowering my price again to show flexibility, but this time I'm firm on it being my final offer. This emphasizes that I'm serious about selling but also that I have other options if we can't agree on a price."
