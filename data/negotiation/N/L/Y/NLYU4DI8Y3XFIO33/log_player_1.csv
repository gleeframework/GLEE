{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You've stated that the product is worth at least $12,000 to you, so this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** You know Bob values the product at $15,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate a price he's comfortable with.
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** By offering a concrete price, you're signaling to Bob that you're ready to negotiate. 

This strategy gives you the best chance of securing a price closer to your ideal outcome while still potentially making a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider reducing the price to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth exploring if you can get a better price. You know Bob values the product at $15,000, and you're only asking for $14,000.  There's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to your desired outcome. By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you can attempt to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** By lowering your price, you demonstrate flexibility.
* **Maintains some profit margin:** $13,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  There's still a gap between your offer and Bob's, allowing for further negotiation if needed.

This approach balances your desire for a higher price with the need to potentially reach an agreement with Bob, ultimately increasing the likelihood of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet at $13,000. Would you consider $12,000 as a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm at his initial offer of $12,000.  You've already lowered your price, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees you your minimum acceptable price.  While you might be able to squeeze out a higher price with Bob, the risk of continued negotiation and potentially no sale is too high.  It's best to secure the guaranteed sale with John."
