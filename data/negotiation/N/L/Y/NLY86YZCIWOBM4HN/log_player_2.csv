Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $850,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value to you is $1,200,000. Plus, I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.

Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

While I'd love to keep negotiating, it seems Alice is firm on her offer. $860,000 is still a good deal compared to John's price, and the additional perks might be valuable. I'll accept the offer and move forward with the purchase."
