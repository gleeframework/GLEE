# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider the product's true value to me.
