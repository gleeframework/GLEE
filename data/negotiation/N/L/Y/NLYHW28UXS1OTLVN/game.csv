Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the rarity of this product, $20000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it,  which is still a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider the product's true value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $18000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's rarity and my initial offer. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $18000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $15000, which is the highest I can go. Let's see if we can close the deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $16500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $16500 is still a bit above where I can go. I'm willing to pay $14000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
