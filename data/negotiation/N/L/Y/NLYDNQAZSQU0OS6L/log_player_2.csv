"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. Given its high value and exceptional quality, it's worth noting that the product holds an immense significance to me, surpassing its monetary worth. However, for the purpose of discussing a transaction, I understand its market value to you stands at $15,000. Considering this, I would like to propose an offer that reflects a fair compromise while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. Would you be interested in acquiring the product for $13,000? This price not only allows you to benefit from the product's true value but also ensures a satisfactory return for us. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's flowery language about the product's ""immense significance"" and ""market value"" is a negotiation tactic.  While she's trying to establish a high starting point, we know:

* **Your maximum:** You're willing to pay $15,000.
* **John's price:** You have a backup option at $15,000.
* **Alice's value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to her.

By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're not easily swayed and open the door for Alice to make a lower counter-offer, potentially closer to her actual value."
