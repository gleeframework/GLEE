"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go while still making a profit. I'm confident this product is worth it to you. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
