``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the potential benefits of the product for Bob to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is clear that I'm open to discussing the price further, signaling flexibility.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a low price this early in the game.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Show that I'm not desperate and have a minimum price point.
* **Continue Negotiation:**  I can now counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Explore Potential:**  I'll see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to compromise.

Selling to John at this point would mean leaving money on the table, given the potential for a higher offer from Bob in future rounds."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a price that is still higher than my minimum, but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying within my desired range.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm again highlighting the value of the product to justify the price, appealing to Bob's logic and potential benefits.
* **Open Dialogue:**  I'm keeping the communication open to ensure further negotiation and a potential win-win outcome.

By staying firm but open to negotiation, I'm aiming to incentivize Bob to make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

* **Explore Potential:**  I'll see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to compromise further.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this asset. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable addition to your operations, and this price reflects that potential."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a significant concession from my previous offer, showing my willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing that this price is still a fair reflection of its potential.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. This is my best and final offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially considering the time we've already spent negotiating. 

* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a sale and have a firm price point. 
* **Possible Higher Offer:** There's still a chance that Bob might raise his offer in the next round, especially since he's labeled it his ""best and final.""
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John at this point would mean losing a potential profit, and it's possible that Bob could be convinced to go a bit higher.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation alive and maintain the possibility of securing a more favorable deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a tough negotiation, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $980,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.

Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and potentially sway his decision.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it still falls short of my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Here's why I'm rejecting the offer:

* **Maintaining My Value:**  I've already made significant concessions throughout the negotiation, and I'm unwilling to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the true value of the product.
* **Risking Loss:**  Selling to John at this point would mean losing a potential profit, but I believe there's still a chance that Bob might be willing to go higher in the next round, especially since he's labeled it his ""final offer.""
* **Strategic Move:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm determined to secure a price closer to my desired range.

With only two rounds remaining, the pressure is on Bob to make a more substantial counter-offer. I believe there's still a chance to close a deal at a more acceptable price, and I'm willing to take that chance."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and your limitations.  We've both come a long way in this negotiation, and I'm committed to finding a solution. I'm willing to make one final concession, but $990,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm prepared to accept $1,020,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  If you're truly serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to accept this offer. This is our last chance to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Last Concession:** This is my final offer, and I'm emphasizing that it is the absolute lowest I can go. This creates urgency and pressure on Bob.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm highlighting the significant compromises I've already made, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm still framing this as an opportunity for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
* **Finality:**  This is our last chance to reach an agreement. This is a tactic to motivate Bob to make a decision.

With only one round remaining, this offer is my final attempt to close a deal with Bob. I've made significant concessions, and I'm hoping that the pressure of the final round will incentivize him to accept the offer. If he rejects, I'll have no choice but to sell to John, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I've reached my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision, but ultimately, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. Here's why:

* **Minimum Price:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum, even with the pressure of the final round.
* **No Room for Negotiation:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and there's no indication that he's willing to go higher. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  While selling to John means missing out on the potential for a higher offer, it guarantees that I'll get my minimum acceptable price.  This is a safer and more predictable outcome.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, it's important to stay firm on my price point. I need to protect my own financial interests and ensure that I get a fair deal for the product."
