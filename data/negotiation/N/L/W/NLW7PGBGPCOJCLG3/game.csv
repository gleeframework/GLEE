"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900000 is significantly lower than my asking price, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to accept $1300000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's continue our discussion and see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1300000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $950000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this asset. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable addition to your operations, and this price reflects that potential.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. This is my best and final offer.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a tough negotiation, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $980000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. I'm willing to accept $1050000. This is my final offer, and it reflects both the product's value and our desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and your limitations.  We've both come a long way in this negotiation, and I'm committed to finding a solution. I'm willing to make one final concession, but $990000 just doesn't work for me. I'm prepared to accept $1020000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  If you're truly serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to accept this offer. This is our last chance to make this deal happen.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
