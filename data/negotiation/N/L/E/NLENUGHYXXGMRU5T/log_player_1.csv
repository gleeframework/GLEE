{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a bit more for the product. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, but I'm confident that I can get at least my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value of $150.  I'll counter with a lower price, but still higher than his offer, to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum of $150.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, I'm not willing to drop my price that low.  John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum, so it's the best choice for me at this point."
