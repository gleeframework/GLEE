"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, close to my desired price point, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price point. While it's tempting to sell to John for $8,000, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my target price with Bob. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects your interest in the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
 
I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to the middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to give up the product for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,750 is still a bit lower than what I'd like, but it's close to my desired price point and within the range I'm willing to accept.  I don't want to risk losing a deal and having to sell to John for a significantly lower amount. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
