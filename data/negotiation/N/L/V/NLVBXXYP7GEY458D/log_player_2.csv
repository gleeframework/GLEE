"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a special price of $12,000. This is a one-time opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, you can likely get a better deal. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for a potentially lower counter-offer from Alice or can purchase from John for $15,000."
