Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price because I know John will pay that amount. This gives Bob a chance to negotiate, but I'm setting a firm baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price.  I'm going to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to offer $115. It's a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's enough to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm going to sell to John.  It's a guarantee of my desired price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower amount."
