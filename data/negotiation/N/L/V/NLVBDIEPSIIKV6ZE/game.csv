"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $10,500?  That would still leave you with a good deal, and it's a price I can live with.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we meet at $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
