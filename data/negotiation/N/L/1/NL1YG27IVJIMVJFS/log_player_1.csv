"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price given its potential.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while leaving room for you to see a strong return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,150,000 is still above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  I believe this offer is fair, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to move closer to your desired price point. While selling to John is an option, there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Bob before accepting a lower amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,050,000? This shows my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is increasing his offers in smaller increments now. It's unlikely he'll reach your $1,000,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees you your desired profit and avoids further negotiation."
