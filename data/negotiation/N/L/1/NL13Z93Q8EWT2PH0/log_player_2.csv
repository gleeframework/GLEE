Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's start our negotiation with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

This is a tough deal, but it's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  It's unlikely she'll accept my first counteroffer, but it's a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice has moved closer to my target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
