Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, potentially leading to a higher final price. 
* **Strong Alternative:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value while staying above my minimum, I increase my chances of maximizing my profit."
