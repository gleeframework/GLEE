# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I think you'll find my price very reasonable.  I'm willing to let it go for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and higher than John's offer. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $10,000."
