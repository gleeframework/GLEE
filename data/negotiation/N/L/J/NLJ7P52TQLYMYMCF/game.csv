"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $575000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",575000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $575000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $585000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",585000.0,Alice,5,
