"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, but I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter with a slightly lower price, but still aiming to get as close to my $100 minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $60 is far below my minimum. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still close to my minimum and a good deal for Bob.  I think this is a fair compromise and hope he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $60, but $90 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $75 is still a little too low for me. Let's try $85. This is a great price for a great product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm still trying to get as close to my $90 offer as possible, but I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still above my minimum and a good deal for Bob, considering he was initially willing to pay $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  How about $80? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is still below my minimum, and we're running out of rounds. I've tried to negotiate, but I don't think I'll be able to get a better price from him.  It's better to sell to John for $100, as I'm guaranteed to reach my minimum profit."
