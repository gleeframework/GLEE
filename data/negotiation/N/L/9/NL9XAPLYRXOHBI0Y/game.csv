"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal if you're willing to compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the value you place on the product, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it still presents a valuable opportunity for your business.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the value I can bring to your business. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. While $1,025,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still slightly below my desired price. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,040,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that considers both our needs. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, Alice. However, $1,040,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $1,020,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford, and I'm willing to walk away if this offer is not accepted. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I need to prioritize my budget.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
