{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,250,000.  This reflects the unique benefits it holds and the potential for future growth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This initial offer aims to:

* **Start high:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my ideal price point while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Set the tone:**  The message highlights the product's value and potential, aiming to pique Bob's interest.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  This price leaves space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's been immediately shut down.

I'm ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he's not willing to meet me somewhere in the middle.  The opportunity to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a deal and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. 

I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from the previous offer, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Reasonable offer:** $1,150,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Focus on finality:**  I've used language like ""bridge the gap"" and ""finalize this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to create a sense of urgency and potentially lead to a final agreement.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reconsider my position and weigh the risk of walking away."
