"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
