# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,250,000.  This reflects the unique benefits it holds and the potential for future growth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, but still within your budget. It's a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000. This is still within your budget and represents a good deal.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that you'll end up paying more by buying from John. Accepting her offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
