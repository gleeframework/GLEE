It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $800,000, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially save some money."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge. This price is still within my budget, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still going to reject her offer and try for a lower price. It's worth seeing if we can meet in the middle."

I'm increasing my offer, but still staying below Alice's current price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."

Alice is not budging much and we've gone back and forth a few times.  While I could keep trying to negotiate, at this point, the potential savings are small and it's becoming more time-consuming. It's more efficient to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
