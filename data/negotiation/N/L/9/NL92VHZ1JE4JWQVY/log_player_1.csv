Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm hoping that he values the product more than $120, but I'm prepared to accept a lower price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's higher than my minimum value of $120, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $130. I'm hoping that this price is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $125. While it's not as high as I initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum value of $120.  It's also higher than what John is offering, so it's the best option for me at this point."
