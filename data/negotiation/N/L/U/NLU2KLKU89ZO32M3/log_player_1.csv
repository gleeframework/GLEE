Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($8,000) to leave some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob is interested and will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a higher price. I'll try to negotiate a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but still trying to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $9,200 is a good price, close to my initial asking price, and higher than what I would get from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing a sale altogether."
