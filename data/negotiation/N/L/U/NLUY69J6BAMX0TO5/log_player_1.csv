{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum desired price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a potential benefit for Bob, emphasizing the product's value to him. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I can potentially maximize my profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum desired price of $12,000 and the possibility of selling to John for that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still negotiate for a higher price. Bob is clearly interested, so there's potential for a successful negotiation.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** I will use the next round to make a counter-offer closer to my desired price. This keeps the negotiation open and gives me more control over the outcome. 
* **Selling to John is a Backup:** I am aware that John is a guaranteed buyer, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. This strategy allows me to explore both options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Compromise:** I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" and the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Upper Hand:**  This counter-offer keeps me closer to my desired price point while still leaving room for potential further negotiations. 

**Strategy:**

By making a compromise counter-offer, I'm hoping to close the gap and secure a price closer to my goal. I'll carefully consider Bob's next move and be prepared to either accept his counter-offer or make another counter-offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** Bob's offer of $9,200 is only $800 away from my minimum desired price of $12,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might end up selling to John at $12,000.
* **Time is Money:** Continued negotiation could drag on, and I'm already close to a good price. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision. It secures a good deal, minimizes risk, and saves time."
