"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for something worth at least $15,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to its actual worth. How about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is higher than Bob's perceived value, it's still lower than my minimum. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to make a bit more than $14,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $16,000?  This would give us both a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some thought and I'd like to propose $15,000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 matches my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.  There's no benefit in continuing the negotiation.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the deal."
