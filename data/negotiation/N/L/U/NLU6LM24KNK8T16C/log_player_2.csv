It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated the price down to $1,025,000, a saving of $475,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further haggling is unlikely to yield a significantly better price. Alice is clearly holding firm close to her bottom line.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Pushing too hard could lead Alice to walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price. 

This deal represents a good balance between getting a favorable price and securing the product."
