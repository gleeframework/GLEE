"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,125,000.  This price is still very fair considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this product. Let's make this happen!",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,080,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your willingness to negotiate. While $1,080,000 is tempting,  I'm still confident that the product's worth justifies a price closer to $1,100,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,090,000.  This way, we both get a great deal, and I can secure the sale for you.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
