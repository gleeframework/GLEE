Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it also leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $135.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $120."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's better than selling to John and still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  It seems like Bob isn't willing to go higher, so it's better to secure a sale at this point."
