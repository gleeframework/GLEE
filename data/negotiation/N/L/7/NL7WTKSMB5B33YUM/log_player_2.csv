"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!  My initial price is $2000000.  Let's discuss further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's too early to buy from John as there's a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1000000 is below my desired price, I am willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1750000.  This reflects the value of the product while considering your budget. Let's work towards a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it shows a willingness to negotiate, it's still too high. Bob has already made a counteroffer, and there's a chance Alice might come down further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This represents a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1250000 is unfortunately still too far below my minimum acceptable price. To demonstrate my willingness to reach a deal, I'm prepared to lower my offer to $1600000. This is a substantial compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a lower price.  He's already made a counteroffer, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. There's still a chance she might lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see your commitment to reaching a deal, and I appreciate your lowering the price. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product, and it's a fair price considering both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts and see that you are serious about acquiring this product. Let's try to find a final solution. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1550000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product and your budget. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer.  It's a risky move to accept, as there's a chance Alice might lower the price further if Bob continues to push.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal. With only a few rounds left, it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if a more favorable price can be achieved."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $1,550,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is a significant jump from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product and our budget constraints. Let's reach a final agreement and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
