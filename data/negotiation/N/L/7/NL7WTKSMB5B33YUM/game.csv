,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1000000 is below my desired price, I am willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1750000.  This reflects the value of the product while considering your budget. Let's work towards a solution.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1750000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This represents a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1250000 is unfortunately still too far below my minimum acceptable price. To demonstrate my willingness to reach a deal, I'm prepared to lower my offer to $1600000. This is a substantial compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see your commitment to reaching a deal, and I appreciate your lowering the price. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1400000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product, and it's a fair price considering both our needs.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts and see that you are serious about acquiring this product. Let's try to find a final solution. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1550000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product and your budget. Let's make this deal happen.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $1550000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to offer $1450000. This is a significant jump from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product and our budget constraints. Let's reach a final agreement and finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
