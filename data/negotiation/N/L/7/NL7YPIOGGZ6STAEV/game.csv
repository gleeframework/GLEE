"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I have to say that I'm a bit surprised by the price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your counteroffer. I'm willing to make another serious offer, but I need to stay within my limit. I'm thinking of $950000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1025000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up on my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, and I'm proposing a price of $1050000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.
