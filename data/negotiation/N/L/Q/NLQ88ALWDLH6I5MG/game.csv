"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value is $15,000. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this works for you!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us and avoid me having to go with another seller. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need $15,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it has to you. Let me know if this works for you!",15500.0,Alice,5,
