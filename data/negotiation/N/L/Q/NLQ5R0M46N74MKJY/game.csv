"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for less than its worth to you, and I'll get a good price for it. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to the lowest price possible.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go above $12,800. I think that's the highest I'm willing to pay. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",12800.0,Bob,4,
