"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $11,500, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my target price.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a little less.  I'm going to offer $10,750.  Let's split the difference and get this deal done.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $10,900. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10900.0,Alice,5,
