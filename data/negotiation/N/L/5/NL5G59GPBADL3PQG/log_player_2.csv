""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is significantly higher than what I had in mind.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to find a buyer, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on its value, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  To be frank, $700,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're open to that, I'm ready to close the deal."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $700,000 is too low.  Would you consider $900,000? This is a significant reduction on my part and a fair offer considering the value this product represents. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, she's still significantly above your $800,000 maximum. It's unlikely she'll come down further than $900,000, especially with 5 rounds remaining.  You can secure the product for your target price from John without further negotiation."
