Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to everyone else. I think a fair price would be $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Starting High:**  By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value and your minimum, you leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""fair price"" and mentioning an ""exclusive offer"" aim to make the price more palatable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you have John as a guaranteed backup to ensure you get your minimum price. 

This approach aims to maximize your potential profit while still maintaining a good chance of making a sale to Bob."
