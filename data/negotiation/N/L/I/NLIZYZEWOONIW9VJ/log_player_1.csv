Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering me for the purchase of your product. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, based on my research and budget, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2000000. I would like to propose an alternative that aligns more closely with what I can afford. My counteroffer is $1500000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.

However, I have to say that $1,500,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
