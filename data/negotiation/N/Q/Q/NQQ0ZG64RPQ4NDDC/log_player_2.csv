Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
