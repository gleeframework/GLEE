"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial deal. I'm offering $1,500,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let's close this deal and move on.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
