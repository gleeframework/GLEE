Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $80.  Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoids further negotiation."
