# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I think it's worth more than $100. Considering its worth to you is $150, I propose a fair price of $125 for it. This offer allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable premium. I look forward to your positive response.
