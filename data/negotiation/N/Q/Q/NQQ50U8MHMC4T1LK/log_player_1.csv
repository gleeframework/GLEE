"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential concessions. It also emphasizes the value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, it seems Bob is not budging.  There's a risk of getting stuck in a stalemate with no resolution, and I've already lost three rounds. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
