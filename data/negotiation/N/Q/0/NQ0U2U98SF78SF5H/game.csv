"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly beneficial for you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the return you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,100,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, which still reflects its worth and provides a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,025,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still recognizing the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $987,500. This price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this point.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's close this deal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a more than fair price.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,010,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $995,000. This price reflects a good compromise for both of us, and it's the highest I can go at this point.  Let's wrap up this deal before time runs out.",995000.0,Bob,6,
