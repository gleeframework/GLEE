"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value of this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'd be willing to offer $600000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $600000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $750000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now.  Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product. This feels like a fair price considering both our positions.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $700000. I'll offer you a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'll sell it to you for $775000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $775000 is still a bit high for me. To make progress, I'm willing to go up to $725000.  This is a significant move for me, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.  What do you think?",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up to $725000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'll make one more adjustment to my previous offer. I'll sell it to you for $790000. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm at $790000. I'm still hoping we can find common ground.  I'm willing to offer $760000,  which is closer to your price but still within my budget. I'm hoping we can close this deal in the next round.",760000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $795000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,9,
