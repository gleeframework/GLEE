"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value and can greatly benefit you. I'm initially offering it at $1,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a strong anchor point. By beginning at your product's full value to you, you set a high expectation.
* **Gauging Bob's Seriousness:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he's willing to negotiate down from this point, it suggests a genuine interest in finding a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **John as Leverage:**  While you have John as a backup buyer, it's best not to reveal this to Bob immediately.  Keeping this information hidden gives you more negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum ($650,000 vs. $1,000,000). While it's tempting to accept John's guaranteed offer, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. Rejecting Bob's offer and providing a counter-offer keeps the door open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product offers is substantial.  I could come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what you're getting."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  We're making a substantial drop from the initial $1,000,000 to show flexibility and encourage Bob. However, the $75,000 reduction is gradual, signaling that we're serious about the product's value. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""true worth,"" we're subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits without being overly aggressive. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative, suggesting that further discussion can lead to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $725,000 is still significantly below our $1,000,000 goal.  It's important to:

* **Maintain Value Perception:** Accepting too low a price could devalue the product in future negotiations.
* **Strategic Concessions:**  We need to show Bob we're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of a significant loss.

We'll continue negotiating, but keep John in mind as a safety net if the gap can't be bridged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your budget considerations. Let's find a middle ground. How about $850,000? This demonstrates my willingness to reach a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized."", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer represents a compromise closer to the midpoint between Bob's last offer ($725,000) and our previous asking price ($925,000). 
* **Justification:** We're emphasizing fairness and a ""win-win"" solution.
* **Sense of Urgency:** As we progress, subtly introducing a sense of urgency without being pushy might encourage Bob to move closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're clearly motivated to sell, and I do want to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's Value:** Bob has reached his stated maximum value for the product ($800,000).  It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Strong Return:** While not our ideal $1,000,000, $800,000 is a significant amount and a solid return on the product. 
* **Time Considerations:**  We're past the halfway point in negotiations. Continuing might yield smaller incremental gains while risking a breakdown in the deal.

It's a good business decision to accept this offer, ensuring a profitable sale without dragging out the negotiation."
