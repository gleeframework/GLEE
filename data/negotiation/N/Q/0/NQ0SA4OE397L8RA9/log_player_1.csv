Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
