"Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,115.0
"I understand that $105 is a bit tight for me too, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $112.50? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $108.75.  That would be a fair price for both of us.",108.75,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $112.50. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it",112.5,Alice,5,,
