Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price that reflects its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $11,500 is a strong starting point, there might be a slight chance Bob would negotiate up a bit.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but there's value in a faster sale to Bob, even at a slight discount. 

By setting the price at $11,500, Alice aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
