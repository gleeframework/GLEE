"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a decent profit. Let's settle this now.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. Let's close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
