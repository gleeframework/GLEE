"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1800000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1800000, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1950000. I believe the product's value and potential returns justify this price. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair deal. Let's meet somewhere in the middle of my initial offer and your latest counteroffer.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'll meet you at $1900000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer on the product.",1900000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made concessions throughout our negotiation, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm afraid I'll have to stand firm at $1900000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if it's not in my best interest.",1900000.0,Alice,9,
