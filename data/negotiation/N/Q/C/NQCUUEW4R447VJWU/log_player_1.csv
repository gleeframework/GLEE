Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows for potential profit.
* **Positive and persuasive:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Alternative buyer:**  The mention of John being a potential buyer adds pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to my business. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe there's room for further negotiation and I can potentially get closer to my ideal price.
* **Alternative buyer pressure:** The option to sell to John for $1,200,000 provides a strong negotiating point. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can show that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I have other options.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer closer to my preferred price, leveraging the pressure of John's offer and the possibility of losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. This would be a significant investment for your business, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return.  I'm happy to discuss this further, but I also have another buyer waiting in the wings who's willing to pay $1,200,000. So, this is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and counteroffer:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer but still remaining above his initial price. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also sets a limit on how low I'm willing to go.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob's business, reinforcing the idea that this is a good investment for him.
* **Time pressure:** I reiterate the presence of John as a backup buyer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Fair offer:** $950,000 represents a fair middle ground, leaving potential profit for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate the offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to my business. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $925,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The potential loss of $275,000 is significant, but it's less risky than holding out and potentially losing the deal with Bob and then having to settle for John's $1,200,000 offer. 

This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the need to secure a sale and avoid potential losses."
