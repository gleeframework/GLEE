Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. This would be a significant investment for your business, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return.  I'm happy to discuss this further, but I also have another buyer waiting in the wings who's willing to pay $1,200,000. So, this is a limited-time offer.
