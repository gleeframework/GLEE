Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $1,150,000 is above your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you're making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $1,150,000 is lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,200,000), leaving room for negotiation and potentially reaching a higher price. 
* **It allows for negotiation:**  This initial offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation with Bob.  

By starting with a reasonable offer and leaving room for negotiation, I increase the chances of a successful deal while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is still above my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it at this point. I believe I can secure a better price through further negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to compromise but not settle for his initial offer. 
* **Is still below Bob's value:**  Bob is still getting a deal, making him more likely to accept.
* **Represents a smaller step:** This encourages Bob to meet me halfway and helps to move the negotiations forward.

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility and increasing the chances of a successful deal while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to continue negotiating, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, there's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he may decide to walk away, and I would be left with only the option of selling to John for a lower price.  

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale at a price that is still above my minimum. This is the most sensible decision given the current circumstances."
