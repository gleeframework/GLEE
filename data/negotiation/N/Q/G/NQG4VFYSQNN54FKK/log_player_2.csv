Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I consider a fair deal.  To be transparent, I have another buyer ready to purchase at a higher price. However, I believe in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. If you're willing to meet me in the middle at $1,500,000, we have a deal. This is my final offer.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a line in the sand.  She's signaled this is her final offer and she has another buyer. It's unlikely she'll go lower.  Since your absolute maximum is $1,000,000 and John will sell it to you at that price, it's time to walk away from Alice and go with your backup plan."
