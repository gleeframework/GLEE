"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $13,500.  This feels like a reasonable compromise. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500.  This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
