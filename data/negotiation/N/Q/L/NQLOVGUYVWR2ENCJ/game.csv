"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a much fairer price considering the value it brings.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
