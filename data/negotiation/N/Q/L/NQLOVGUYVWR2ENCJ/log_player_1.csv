Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a much fairer price considering the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has now hit his maximum valuation for the product.  It's clear he won't go any higher. Accepting $800,000 would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
