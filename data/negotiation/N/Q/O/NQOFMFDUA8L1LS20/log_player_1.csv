Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $180. I think it's a great deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 180} 
 
I'm starting high to gauge your interest and leave room for negotiation.  Even if you counter significantly lower, I'm still above my minimum selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $140 is tempting, I know he's willing to go higher. I'll try to meet him in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}

This counteroffer lands squarely between my initial offer and his counter. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $145. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is clearly holding firm around this price point. While I could push for a bit more, taking the $145 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of losing both potential buyers."
