Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I start with a significantly higher price ($2,250,000) than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the high price as a reflection of its ""unique benefits.""
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, ensuring I won't make a loss. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response and potentially lower the price to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
