"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a great price for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to Bob's goal, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob has leverage with the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'm going to have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $110, which is $112.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $112.5 is closer to Bob's target, he can still try to get a lower price. There are 5 rounds remaining, and he has the option of buying from John as a safety net. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not there yet. I'm going to stick with my offer of $110. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $112, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $112, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $110. With only 3 rounds left, it's likely that Alice won't budge further. Accepting this offer secures a decent deal for Bob and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity to buy the product from Alice."
