Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $825,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we settle on $800,000? This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is at her limit:** Alice has stated this is her final offer and she has another buyer. This implies she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Meeting your goal:**  $800,000 is within your $1,000,000 budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's offer. 

It's a risk to push further as you might lose the deal entirely. Accepting now secures the product at a favorable price."
