"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $115? ",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $115 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more for my product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $120?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. ",120.0,Bob,4,
