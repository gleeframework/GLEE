"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, it's still above your target of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is still a good price for Alice since it's above her value of $100. This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't budge.  This strategy gives me the best chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within my budget of $150 and is a good compromise. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
