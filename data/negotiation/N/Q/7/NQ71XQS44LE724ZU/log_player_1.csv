I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below my minimum price of $100.  I also have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and offer the product for $135. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."
