Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, offering it at $14,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($1,000).
* **First-Mover Advantage:** Offering Bob the product first at a slightly discounted price creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially leading him to accept quickly. 
* **Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000 if Bob declines. This knowledge empowers you to aim higher with Bob."
