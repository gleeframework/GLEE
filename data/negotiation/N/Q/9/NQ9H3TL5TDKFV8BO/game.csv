"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,
