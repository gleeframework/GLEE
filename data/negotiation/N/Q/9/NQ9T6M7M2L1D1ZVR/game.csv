"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This reflects its significance while still offering you a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
