"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm interested in the product, but I think I can get a better deal. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so I'm not sure why she's offering it to me for $110. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better deal elsewhere.
