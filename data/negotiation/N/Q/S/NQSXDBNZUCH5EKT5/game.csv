"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on $900,000.  This is a significant amount of money for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive for the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to negotiate. However,  $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a significant amount for me, and it's a fair price given the value you'll receive. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for me. I believe this is a fair price, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
