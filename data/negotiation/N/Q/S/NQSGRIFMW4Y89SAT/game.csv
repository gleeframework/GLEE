"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $12500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13250. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,
