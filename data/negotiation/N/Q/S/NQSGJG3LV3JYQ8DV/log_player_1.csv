Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $120 is above your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him an incentive to accept. 
* **It tests the waters:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 

If Bob rejects, you can adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $120.  I believe there's room for further negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and hopefully gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $100 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Signaling flexibility:** This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Maintaining a margin:** This price still allows me to earn a decent profit while potentially reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is just slightly below my last offer of $100, and it's only $5 less than my absolute minimum of $80.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale.  It's a good deal considering the potential risk of further haggling and the possibility of Bob walking away entirely."
