"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, my budget is limited and I am not able to pay $1200000 for it. Could you perhaps consider lowering the price? I am willing to pay up to $950000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1050000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet your current price. I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our budgets.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I like the direction we're heading, Bob! $1000000 is a good starting point, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle of our previous offers. How about we try $1025000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I am willing to pay $1010000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
