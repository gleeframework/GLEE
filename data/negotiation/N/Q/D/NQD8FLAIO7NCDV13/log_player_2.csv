"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's value for me. While I do see the potential, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $12,500 is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's closer, it's not worth continuing to negotiate.  John is offering the product for my maximum price, so I'll buy it from him to save money and avoid further negotiation."
