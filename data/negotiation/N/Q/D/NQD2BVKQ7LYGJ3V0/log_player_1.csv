"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with him or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is far too low.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant.  I'm confident that we can find a more agreeable price in the next round.  There are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum price.  Let's try $850,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I know I can buy the product elsewhere for this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer more, $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  Bob has made it clear this is his final offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to accept his offer than to risk getting nothing."
