Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. 

I'll be watching closely to see if Bob accepts or makes a counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer carefully and adjust my own accordingly.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept Bob's first counteroffer.  He's essentially trying to get the product for my absolute minimum.  I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price of $10,000.  I'll counteroffer and see where we go from there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my original asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough to Bob to accept, but I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $8,500 is close enough to my minimum price of $8,000. I'm willing to accept this offer and sell the product to him.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a good outcome considering the circumstances."
