"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $95 is within your budget, it's still a significant markup from the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is still above Alice's value of $80, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still higher than I'd like to pay. While it's closer to my preferred price, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $90. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's more favorable to me. This also leaves some room for Alice to potentially counteroffer again, allowing for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. There are still rounds left, so I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. I'm starting to run out of time, so I'll need to be more aggressive in my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $95, which is higher than my previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to compromise while still pushing for a more favorable price. With only a few rounds remaining, I need to start getting closer to a deal while still maintaining some negotiation leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is getting too high. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and it's unlikely she'll come down significantly further. At this point, it's more beneficial to purchase from John for $150. While it's a higher price, it guarantees the purchase and saves me further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiation."
