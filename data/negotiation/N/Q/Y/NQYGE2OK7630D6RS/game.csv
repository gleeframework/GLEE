"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still represents a good value for you.  Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $950,000.  However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for this product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $975,000 is a good offer, but it's still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one final concession, and come down to $985,000. This is my absolute best price. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",985000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at $985,000. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $975,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that buying from John for $800,000 might be a better option for me.",975000.0,Bob,8,
