"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves some room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice seems unwilling to go lower than $9,500.  This is still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's time to cut his losses and buy from John."
