"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and even slightly above my own minimum ($1,000,000), I aim to set a strong anchor. This might shift Bob's perception of the product's potential value.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting point allows ample room for negotiation over subsequent rounds, increasing the likelihood of reaching a price favorable to me. 
* **John as Backup:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides me with a strong fallback position and allows me to negotiate more confidently with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a higher price while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects my commitment to finding a fair agreement while acknowledging the true potential of this asset."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing appreciation for his negotiation. This helps maintain a positive atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:** While I decrease my asking price significantly, I'm still aiming higher than the midpoint between his offer ($900,000) and my previous ask ($1,300,000). 
* **Value Reiteration:** I continue to subtly emphasize the product's unique value to justify the higher price, without directly dismissing Bob's perception.
* **Pressure to Compromise:**  This counter-offer puts the ball back in Bob's court and encourages him to make a more significant move towards my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could push for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will be willing to go any higher. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
