"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects my commitment to finding a fair agreement while acknowledging the true potential of this asset.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
