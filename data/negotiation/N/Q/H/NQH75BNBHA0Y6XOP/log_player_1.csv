Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could secure a quicker sale and still net a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong offer that is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
    * Still allows for potential negotiation.
    * Creates a sense of urgency (""other interested parties"").

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This offer assumes Bob is willing to negotiate and sees some value beyond his initial assessment. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If time is a significant factor, a slightly lower offer might be more appealing to avoid the risk of dealing with John."
