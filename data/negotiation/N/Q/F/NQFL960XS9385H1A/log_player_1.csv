"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10,000. It's worth a lot more to you than that, so I think it's a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This product is truly worth a lot more than that to you, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much. He's now gone below my minimum acceptable price, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk him continuing to lower the price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on that."
