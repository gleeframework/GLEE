,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,90.0
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that $120 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $110 for the product?",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,100.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $100 for the product? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",100.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I understand you're really stretching your budget, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $100, but I can see you're serious about getting this product. I'll compromise at $105. That's the lowest I can go.",105.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,98.0
"I really want this product, Alice, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offer, so how about we try $102.50 for the product?",102.5,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think you really need this product. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50, but I'll throw in a small bonus for you - I'll also include a free accessory that normally costs $20. So, the total value you'll get is $122.50. What do you say?",102.5,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,95.0
"I appreciate the bonus, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $102.50. I'm willing to go up to $95 for the product, and I'd like to keep the free accessory as a bonus if we can agree on a price. Can we meet at $95?",95.0,Bob,8,,
