Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer the product for $100 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price. This allows me to potentially earn more than $80 (Bob's perceived value) but less than John's guaranteed offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $95 makes it seem like a bargain compared to a potential $100 price tag, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a single offer scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, allowing for further profit."
