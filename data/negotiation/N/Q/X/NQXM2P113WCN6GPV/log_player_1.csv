"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. I believe he'll likely counter-offer, allowing us to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $10,500. This shows I'm willing to be flexible, while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm confident he'll see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm running out of time.  While I'm determined to get the highest price possible, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $10,000. It's time to secure the deal with John."
