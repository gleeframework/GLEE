# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think?

While $800,000 is a good deal, it's still within Alice's desired range. I can likely get a better price by negotiating further."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $700,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $650,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $650000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $675000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I would prefer a lower price,  $675,000 is a good deal considering the product's value to me and the time spent negotiating. Accepting this offer saves me $325,000 compared to buying from John."
