"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is too high, and I want to try to negotiate a lower price. 
* I have 10 rounds to close the deal, so rejecting the offer and counteroffering makes sense. 
* I will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Alice don't go well."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I can't go that high.  I'm ready to pay $850,000 for the product right now.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $975,000. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice has offered the same price ($975,000) twice in a row, indicating that she's unlikely to budge further.
* We are already in Round 5, leaving only 5 rounds to reach a deal.
*  Given the time pressure and Alice's reluctance to lower her price, it's more prudent to accept John's offer of $800,000. This guarantees a purchase within my budget and ensures a successful outcome."
