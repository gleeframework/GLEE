"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I can't go that high.  I'm ready to pay $850,000 for the product right now. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your asking price and allows me to buy within my budget. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find this offer more reasonable.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and we're getting much closer.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $975,000. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable.",975000.0,Alice,5,
