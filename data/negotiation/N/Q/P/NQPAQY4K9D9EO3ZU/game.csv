"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get closer to the value I think it's worth to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8250. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is your maximum, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8100. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",8100.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $8100, which would be $8050. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8050.0,Bob,6,
