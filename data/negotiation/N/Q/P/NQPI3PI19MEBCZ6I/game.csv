"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go as high as $15,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's make this deal happen.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. This is my final offer. Let's make this happen.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $16,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price. ",16250.0,Bob,6,
