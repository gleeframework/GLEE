"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in your product, and I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while still staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,000. This is still a great value for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm very motivated to buy your product, and I'm ready to pay $10,000 for it. This is a strong offer that demonstrates my commitment to this deal, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this and make it happen!",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're motivated to buy the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I value the product and am ready to buy, $10,800 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $10,500 for it. This is a strong offer that demonstrates my commitment to this deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this and make it happen!",10500.0,Bob,6,
