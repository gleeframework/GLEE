"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and is still within a reasonable range for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is below the value I place on this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a significant gain.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
