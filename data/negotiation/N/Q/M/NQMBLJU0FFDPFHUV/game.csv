"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and exclusivity. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $15000.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and exclusivity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $16000, which is a fair price considering my budget. What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $16000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $17500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
