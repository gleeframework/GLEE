You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $97. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we compromise at $102? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $102 gets you a decent discount from both Alice's original offer and John's price."
