"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we try $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I can meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the value the product will bring to your business.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't go that high.  My absolute limit is $12,500.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500, and I'm starting to think that's too low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $13,000. This is my last offer, and I expect you to accept it.",13000.0,Alice,7,
