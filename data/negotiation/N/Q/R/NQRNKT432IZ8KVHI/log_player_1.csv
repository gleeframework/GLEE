Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows us to potentially maximize profit.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it at or slightly above his valuation is unlikely to be successful. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** A price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's valuation. It represents a potential gain of $500,000 for Bob if he utilizes the product effectively.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. We can adjust the price during negotiation depending on Bob's response."
