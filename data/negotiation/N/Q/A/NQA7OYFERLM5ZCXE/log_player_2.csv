"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay $8,000. Alice's first offer is too high, so you should reject it and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are still willing to pay $8,000. Alice's offer is still too high, although she has lowered it. You should reject her offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,500.  If that works for you, we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's reach an agreement now, so we can both move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still holding out for $8,000, and Alice is only at $9,000. You should try to negotiate further to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and it will allow us to both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my price, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Let's close this deal now to avoid any further negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not willing to budge much more, and you're only willing to go as high as $8,750.  You're getting close, but it's unlikely you'll get a better price than John's offer of $8,000.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
