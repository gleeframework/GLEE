# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's rarity and potential value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?
