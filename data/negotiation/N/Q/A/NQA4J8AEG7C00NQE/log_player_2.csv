"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. It makes no sense to accept a price that's $50 more than you need to pay."
