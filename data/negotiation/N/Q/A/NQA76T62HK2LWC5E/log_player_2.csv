Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work. This still gives you a significant discount, and it's a price that I can reasonably accept. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen. What do you think?
