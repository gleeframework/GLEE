{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and it seems like Bob won't budge further.  I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing out to John or continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
