"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. He has a better option in John, and should use this round to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm not able to go down to $850,000, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. Bob should continue negotiating, as he can still get a better deal.  He has 7 more rounds to work with and John is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we both see in this transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer!  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to gain something from this deal.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he's still within his negotiation range and has 5 rounds remaining. He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He can always fall back on John if the negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a middle ground.  Let's try $925,000.  It's a good compromise that allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
