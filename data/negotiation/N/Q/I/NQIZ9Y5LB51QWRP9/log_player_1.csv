Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point - it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures I can get a good deal if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counter-offering at $100. This is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob's offer was lower than my initial offer.  However, I'm confident that $100 is still a fair price given the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's offer of $85 is still significantly better than selling to John for $80.  I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
