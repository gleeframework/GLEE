Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to propose $800,000 as a starting point for our discussion.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
