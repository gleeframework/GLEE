"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to propose $800,000 as a starting point for our discussion.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still recognizing the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
