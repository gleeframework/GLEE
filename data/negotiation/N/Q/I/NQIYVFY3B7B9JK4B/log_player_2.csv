"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  It's better to see if Alice will go lower before considering John's offer or accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to propose $800,000 as a starting point for our discussion.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still recognizing the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and $850,000 is a good deal for me. While I could potentially get it lower, there's a risk of Alice getting stubborn or the negotiation dragging on. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product for a good price without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
