Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
