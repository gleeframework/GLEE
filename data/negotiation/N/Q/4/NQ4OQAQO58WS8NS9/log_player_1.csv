I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point that allows for potential negotiation while ensuring I get a price closer to the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering to sell the product for $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still below what I initially wanted, I've already been through a couple rounds of negotiation, and I'm concerned that if I reject his offer again, he might simply walk away and I'll be stuck with the lower price from John. $13,000 is a good middle ground, securing a better price than John's offer."
