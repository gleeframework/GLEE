{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that's higher than your minimum value but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. It also uses a friendly tone to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $120. Would you consider lowering the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
