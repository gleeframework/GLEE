{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation if he rejects it. This also avoids immediately accepting John's offer at $150, which gives Bob the opportunity to bargain and potentially increase my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still far below my minimum of $150.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  This way, we both get closer to what we're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $97.5 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a price closer to $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to make this work, but I can't go any lower than $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
