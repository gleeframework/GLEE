"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly lower than the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $900000 to make this work for me.  Let's find a middle ground that's fair to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900000. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $875000. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a deal without compromising my minimum price.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $860000? I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.",860000.0,Bob,6,
