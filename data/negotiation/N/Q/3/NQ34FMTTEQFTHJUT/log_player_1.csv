Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $50,000 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, which allows for some negotiation without jeopardizing your desired profit.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value and sets a high starting point for the negotiation.

By offering this price, you're positioning yourself to potentially secure a higher price while leaving room for flexibility and ensuring you don't walk away with less than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am only able to pay $850,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below your desired value.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which reflects the value you've expressed. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a higher price:** You're still aiming for a price closer to your initial offer. 
* **Show flexibility:** You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering your price slightly.
* **Be firm but reasonable:** This offer is a compromise that still gives you a good profit while being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. I am willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still not meeting your minimum. With this offer, you are only $25,000 away from your minimum. While it is tempting to keep negotiating with Bob, the risk is that he will refuse to increase his offer again, and you will be left with no other choice than to sell to John. 

Given that you can sell to John for $800,000, it is a safer choice to accept the deal and secure a guaranteed profit."
