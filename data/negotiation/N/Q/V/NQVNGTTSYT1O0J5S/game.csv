"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $6,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $6,500 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $5,500 for it. This represents a significant discount and would allow me to comfortably purchase it within my budget.",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $5,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",6000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I understand your position, $6,000 is still slightly higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $5,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",5750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $5,900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",5900.0,Alice,5,
