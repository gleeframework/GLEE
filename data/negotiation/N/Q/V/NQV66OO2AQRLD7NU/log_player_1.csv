Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification for the price:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" creates a sense of scarcity and desirability, justifying the high price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere between his valuation ($800,000) and yours ($1,000,000).

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial deal."
