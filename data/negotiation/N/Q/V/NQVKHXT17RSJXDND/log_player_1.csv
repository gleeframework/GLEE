"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also setting a positive tone by highlighting the product's value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with some further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,800? I'm still confident this product will be of great value to you."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,600 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $8,700? This price reflects the value of the product for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8650 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $8,650 is only $50 less than my last counteroffer. It's a good deal considering the time spent negotiating and the risk of him walking away or me selling to John. It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
