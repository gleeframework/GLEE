"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $75. We believe this is a fair deal that allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $75 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his maximum price of $80 and still benefits Alice.  There's no need to risk further negotiation or paying John's higher price."
