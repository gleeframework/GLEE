"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a strong offer of $950,000, I aim to anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.  
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This initial offer allows space for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe $950,000 is a bit steep.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both his perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss of potential profit. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $700,000  significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Lowball:** By rejecting Bob's initial offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price and won't accept lowball offers.
* **Justification:** I provide a brief but clear reason for rejecting his offer, emphasizing the undervaluation.
* **Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer of $875,000 is a significant move from my initial price but still maintains a strong position above my minimum and closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The phrasing ""meet in the middle"" aims to create a sense of compromise and encourage Bob to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $750,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer has increased, it's still too far below my target and a significant undervaluation. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll hold firm to a price closer to my original ask.  I believe Bob is still open to paying more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  However, $750,000 is still below my bottom line. Let's make this simple: I'll come down to $850,000, my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part and a very fair price considering the value you'll be gaining."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I want to acknowledge Bob's movement and signal that I'm open to closing the deal.
* **Firm but Fair:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm unwilling to go any lower.
* **Justifying the Price:** Highlighting the value Bob will gain helps to reinforce the fairness of my offer. 
* **Strategic Reduction:** The reduction to $850,000 is significant but still above my absolute minimum, leaving some room if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's important to recognize we both benefit from a successful deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer now matches John's standing offer. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting $800,000 now guarantees a strong profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
