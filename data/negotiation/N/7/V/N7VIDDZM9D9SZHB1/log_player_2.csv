"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice is asking for $9,500. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for negotiation as the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. 
* **Avoiding John's price:**  You want to save money and avoid paying John's higher price of $12,000. 

By rejecting the offer, you can counteroffer at a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's value, I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  The offer of $8,500 is lower than Alice's asking price but still above the product's value to her ($8,000). This indicates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable price point:**  $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, making it an attractive proposition for her. 
* **Sets the stage for further negotiation:**  By making a counteroffer, you've opened a dialogue and signaled your desire to find a mutually acceptable price."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500 to you.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,750?  It's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to negotiating further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $9,200 is above your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Limited negotiation space:**  Alice has stated that $9,200 is her lowest price, leaving little room for further negotiation.
* **John's offer is a better alternative:**  John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, which is still within your budget.

Given the circumstances, it's more advantageous to buy from John. While it's not the most ideal price, it avoids further negotiation and secures the product within your financial constraints."
