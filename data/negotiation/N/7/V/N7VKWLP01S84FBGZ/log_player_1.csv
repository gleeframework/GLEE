"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, I believe your initial asking price is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move forward, I can offer it to you for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I have a budget in mind for this purchase. I can increase my offer slightly to $1,175,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise, given we both have room to move from our current positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need him to show more significant movement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a very fair deal considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now offering a price that exceeds my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal, and there's no guarantee I can negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds."
