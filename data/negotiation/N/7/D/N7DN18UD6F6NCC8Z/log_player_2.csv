Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close to my minimum as possible. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000?

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're nearing the end:**  With only a few rounds left, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.
* **Reasonable price:** $1,050,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Pushing further might make Alice reconsider and could lead to you losing the deal altogether."
