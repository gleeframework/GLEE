Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you should aim to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 allows a small buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While you could start at $150, it might make Bob less likely to negotiate. A slightly lower price shows a willingness to make a deal. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't lose the sale to John."
