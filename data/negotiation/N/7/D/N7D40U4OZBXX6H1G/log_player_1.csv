{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $12,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to earn more, $11,250 is a decent price considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and the potential risk of losing him as a buyer. It's also higher than what John is offering, so this is the best option for me at this moment."
