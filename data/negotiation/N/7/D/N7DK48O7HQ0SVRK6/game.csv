"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,200 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original offer, so how about $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,4,
