Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a significant asset to you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,450,000 offer leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might try to bargain, but you know you have John as a safety net. 
* **Profit Maximization:**  This strategy aims to secure the maximum profit possible. If Bob accepts, you earn significantly more. If he rejects, you still get your desired price from John."
