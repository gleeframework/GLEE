Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $175 offers a potential $25 profit over your minimum while still being within a reasonable markup range.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price if he wants, still keeping you above your minimum."
