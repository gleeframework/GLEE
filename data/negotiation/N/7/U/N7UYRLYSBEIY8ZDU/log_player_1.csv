Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point.** It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It highlights the potential value for Bob while also being assertive about the price. 
* **This strategy aims to:**
    * Secure a good price quickly. 
    * Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.
    *  If Bob rejects, I can then use his counteroffer to adjust my strategy and maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price.  The goal is to meet in the middle and get closer to my desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** Instead of rejecting outright, I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway. $10,500 is a reasonable compromise that bridges the gap between our offers.
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:** I'm emphasizing that even at $10,500, Bob is still getting a significant discount on the product's value to him. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication open and encouraging further discussion, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is only $200 lower than my last counteroffer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over selling to John for $8,000. Accepting this offer is the best choice to maximize my profit at this point. The risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a breakdown in negotiations, which could result in selling to John for less."
