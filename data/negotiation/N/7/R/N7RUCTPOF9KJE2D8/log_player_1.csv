Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'd be willing to let it go for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  Offering $9,500 allows for a potential compromise at $9,000 or even $8,500.
* **Motivating Bob:** By starting high, I'm pushing Bob to make a counteroffer, which keeps the negotiation moving. 
* **Back-up plan:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I know John is willing to buy for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer. 

I'll counter with a price closer to $9,000, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $8,800? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $8,800 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,200.
* **Showcasing flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $8,800 is still above my minimum of $10,000, so I'm not giving up too much.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize that this price allows both of us to be happy, suggesting that the deal is beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the direction we're heading, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $8,500 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation stalemate:**  We've reached a point where further negotiation might not yield much higher offers from Bob.
* **John's offer is still there:**  I have a backup option with John, so I'm not pressured to take a drastically lower price.

Considering the potential for further negotiation stalemate, and the fact that I can still sell to John for $10,000, accepting Bob's offer at $8,500 seems like the best choice at this moment."
