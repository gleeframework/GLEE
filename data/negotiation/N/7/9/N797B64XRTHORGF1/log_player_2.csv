# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency about your budget. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,125,000. This is my best offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

Alice has signaled this is her best offer, and while there are rounds left, the increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price than $1,125,000."
