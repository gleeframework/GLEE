"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is below her perceived value, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and John's offer. You have a better alternative with John, so you should reject Alice's offer and proceed to buy from John."
