"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to you.  Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This is still a good deal for both of us as it's well above your value for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,500 is my final offer. This still gives you a great deal on a product that's worth $15,000 to you.  Let's close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
