"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my highest possible price.  Since I know the product is worth $12,000 to me, I'm not willing to settle for less, and John is a guaranteed sale at that price.  This gives me the most leverage in the negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $10,000, I know the product is worth more to me. I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $11,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm hoping this will push him closer to my target."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for improvement. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him further. With only four rounds left, I want to make sure I get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900} 
```

I'm going to make a small counteroffer of $10,900. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to close the gap between our prices. With limited rounds left, I need to find a price both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. While Bob is offering a price that's getting close to my minimum, I'm worried that we won't be able to close the deal in the remaining rounds. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John. Selling to John will ensure I get my minimum price and avoid further negotiation."
