Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay closer to my value, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value of $12,000, it's still significantly below what I want. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his, and I believe it shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would like to continue negotiating with Bob, his last offer of $9,000 is simply too low.  John is offering a significantly higher price of $12,000, which meets my minimum value.  It's best to accept John's offer and secure a good price for the product."
