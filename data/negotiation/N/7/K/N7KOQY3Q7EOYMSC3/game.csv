"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, my budget allows me to invest up to $1000000 in such an item. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $950000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  To bridge the gap, I'd be willing to lower my price to $1100000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value this product holds.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I've reviewed your latest offer of $1100000, and while it's closer to my maximum, I still believe we can find common ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $1050000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration, and I look forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
