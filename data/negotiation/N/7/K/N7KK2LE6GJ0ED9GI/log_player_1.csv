{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum but also keeping in mind Bob's perceived value.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price with further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's not a perfect outcome, but it's a good deal considering that I could always sell to John for $10,000. It's also possible that further negotiation with Bob could lower the price again, so I'm accepting his offer."
