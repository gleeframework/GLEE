Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a little.
* **Close to Bob's value:** Offering the product at $14,500 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but it's close enough that he might be tempted. 
* **Alternative buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider."
