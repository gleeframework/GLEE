Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,000,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.

Alice is now matching the price John offers, and there's no benefit to haggling further.  It's best to accept and avoid potentially losing the deal."
