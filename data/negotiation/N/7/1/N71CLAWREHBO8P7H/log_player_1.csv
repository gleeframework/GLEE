Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still ensuring you make a substantial profit.  
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value but avoids being overly specific. This allows Bob to potentially see value beyond his initial $800,000 assessment.

**Goal:**  This strategy aims to either:

*  **Maximize profit:**  Secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value. 
* **Fall back on John:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can proceed with selling to John at your desired price."
