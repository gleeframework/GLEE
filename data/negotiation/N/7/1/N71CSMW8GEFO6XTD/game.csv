"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. It's the highest I can go at this point.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $105? It's the lowest I'm willing to go.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me. I'm still stuck at $100, which is my absolute maximum.  If you can't go lower than $105, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
