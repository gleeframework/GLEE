"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $950,000 for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, and Bob can always buy from John for $800,000 if no deal is reached with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the value and benefits of our product, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. My proposal is $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the true value of our offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $800,000.  However, it's a significant drop from the initial $950,000. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, as he can always buy from John for $800,000 if a deal isn't reached.  There are still 7 rounds left to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to go to $875,000, a price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
