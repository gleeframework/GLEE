"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that sets the stage for negotiation. It's important to start high as I can always go lower if needed, but I can't go higher later.  I'll be closely watching Bob's reaction to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my initial asking price and I believe I can get closer to my desired value. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, showing I'm serious about making a deal. It's a significant step down from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful that I can get a bit more. I'll counter in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but still above Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob my willingness to compromise, and that we can find a middle ground to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, Bob's stubbornness has pushed the negotiation down to my minimum acceptable price.  With only four rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of further haggling with Bob, as I could end up with nothing.  Selling to John guarantees me a safe and reasonable profit."
