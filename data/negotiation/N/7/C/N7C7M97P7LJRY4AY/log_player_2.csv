"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $90 is a good price, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $85. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still a bit above $80, which is my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:**  $87.50 is only $2.50 more than your desired price of $85.
* **You're running out of time:**  You only have 7 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal, and John is still offering a higher price. 
* **The value to Alice is $80:** This means Alice is willing to make a small profit, indicating she's likely at the limit of her negotiation.

While you can try to squeeze out a little more, accepting this offer is a good compromise that secures the product for a price within your budget."
