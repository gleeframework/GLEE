"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a great deal on a product with tremendous potential."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I've already lowered my price considerably. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,400,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's better to accept Bob's offer than risk losing him as a buyer and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
