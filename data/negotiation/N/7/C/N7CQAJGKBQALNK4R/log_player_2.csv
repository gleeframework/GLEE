{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is close to my limit, there's still room to negotiate. I'll try to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum budget but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Alice is likely motivated to sell, so this should spark a back-and-forth that might lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still willing to negotiate, and I believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll try to push her down to my maximum limit of $10,000 before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but keeping it below my maximum budget.  I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further and if I can close the deal before having to resort to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still within my budget and there's a good chance Alice might come down to my limit.  I'm going to push for a better deal before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10400}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a slight increase in my counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about buying the product. This is a compromise that's still within my budget. I believe that with a little more negotiation, I can convince her to meet my maximum budget of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get the product for my maximum budget of $10,000, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting Alice's offer at $10,700 is still a good deal for me and avoids the risk of losing the product altogether if I push too hard and she rejects my next counteroffer."
