"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value and what I'm looking to get for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on $9,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's the most I can afford. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $9,000.  While a deal might be reached eventually, it's not worth risking the guaranteed $10,000 from John.  It's time to cut bait and take the sure thing."
