Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe it's a fair offer considering what it can do for you.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to start the negotiation higher. This leaves space for potential negotiation downwards while still ensuring you get a good deal.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the value proposition (""what it can do for you"") helps justify the higher price, even though Bob values it less in absolute terms.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests a willingness to discuss the price, making Bob feel more comfortable counter-offering. 

By starting high and engaging in a dialogue, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a price closer to Bob's perceived value, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
