"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be useful to me, but I'm only willing to pay a price that reflects its value to me. How about $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique benefits that you won't find elsewhere. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both work with. To be honest, $11,000 is still a stretch for me. I'd be willing to consider $6,500.  This offer reflects the maximum value I can currently justify for the product.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations here. While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? This is a significant compromise on my end.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to increase my offer to show that I'm serious about purchasing this product. How about $7,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a fair agreement.",7500.0,Bob,6,
