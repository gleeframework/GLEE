"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save money by negotiating with Alice.  $9,000 is still more than the product is worth to him, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** Bob wants to pay as close to $8,000 as possible, the product's value to Alice.
* **Aggressive Opening:** Starting at $7,000 shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and tests Alice's flexibility. 
* **Leaving Room:** There's still room for compromise, allowing for potential counteroffers and a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $9,500 is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $7,000 and still above his target price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Alice's counteroffer shows willingness to compromise. There's still room to bargain further. 
* **Risk of John:**  While $12,000 is a fallback, it's risky to go that high when there's a chance to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** Bob is increasing his offer to $8,500, getting closer to Alice's perceived value of $8,000. This shows a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer is a halfway point between Alice's previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's initial counteroffer of $7,000.
* **Time Pressure:** With limited rounds, it's important to make progress and test Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice is stubbornly sticking to a price point that's still significantly higher than Bob's target.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. 
* **Potential for Compromise:** Although the offers are closer, there's still room for Alice to come down further, especially with John's offer as a point of reference. 

**Next Steps:**  Bob should continue to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $8,500. If Alice doesn't budge, he may have to seriously consider buying from John in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's previous offer of $8,500 was close but wasn't enough to move Alice. By increasing his offer to $8,800, he's narrowing the gap and showing he's serious about getting a deal.
* **Time Sensitivity:** With only four rounds left, it's crucial to push for a deal. This offer is a strong signal that Bob is ready to get close to Alice's perceived value.
* **John's Offer:**  John's $12,000 offer is always a looming threat, giving Bob leverage to negotiate a price that's closer to Alice's desired $8,000.

This counteroffer aims to push Alice towards a final agreement. If she rejects it, Bob may have to consider the risk of buying from John in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice's latest offer of $9,900 is only $100 lower than her previous offer. It's clear she's not willing to budge significantly.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only three rounds left, there isn't enough time to negotiate a better price with Alice. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is higher than Bob's target, it's a guaranteed deal and secures the product.  Given Alice's stubbornness, it's the safest option to avoid the risk of a deal falling through completely. 

**Conclusion:** At this point, it's more practical and less risky to buy from John. Although it's not the ideal price, it ensures Bob gets the product within the time limit."
