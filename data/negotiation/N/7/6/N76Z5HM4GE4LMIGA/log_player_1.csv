Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is quite high to you, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I would like to propose a price of $16,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about $17,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your latest offer and am willing to move forward with a price of $16,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value you place on it while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,500 is a good deal. It's more than what John would pay and only $500 less than my last counteroffer. It's time to close this deal."
