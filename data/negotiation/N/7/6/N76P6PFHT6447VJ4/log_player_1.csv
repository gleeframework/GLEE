"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High initial offer:**  Starting high allows for room to negotiate and gives you leverage.
* **Emphasis on value:** Mentioning the product's potential value to Bob might pique his interest.
* **Open-ended question:**  The question ""Let me know your thoughts"" encourages Bob to engage and makes it less likely for him to immediately reject the offer. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started while keeping the door open to John's offer if Bob doesn't bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. $1000000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $750,000 is less than my floor price of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have the chance to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations fail, I can still secure $800,000 from John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $850,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not drastically lowering my price, but I'm also not being completely inflexible. This shows I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Highlighting the value:**  By saying ""I'm open to negotiation,"" I subtly remind Bob that the product is valuable.
* **Encouraging further dialogue:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still keeping the price above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible. While $850000 is closer, I'm still hoping to stay closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $800000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 matches my floor price, meaning I won't get a better deal from him.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could result in Bob walking away or offering a lower price.
* **John's offer is the same:**  John is also willing to pay $800,000, so there's no advantage to selling to him instead of Bob.

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and secure my minimum desired price without risking a less favorable outcome."
