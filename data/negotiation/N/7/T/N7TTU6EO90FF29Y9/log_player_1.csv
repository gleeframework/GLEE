Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his perceived value is $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to justify the high price and make it more appealing to Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer instead of forcing you to settle for your backup with John."
