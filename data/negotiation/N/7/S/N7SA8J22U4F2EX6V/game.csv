"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $8,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
