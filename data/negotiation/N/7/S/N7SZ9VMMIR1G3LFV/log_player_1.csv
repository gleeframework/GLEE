Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows Bob to get a good deal.  Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he has incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered and what you believe the product is worth. There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still below my ideal price. There's still room to push for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still a significant amount above Bob's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still holding onto the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but it's still below what I'd like to get.  The negotiation seems to be going in circles and I'm concerned we're getting bogged down.  To avoid further delays, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's still a reasonable profit and ensures a quick sale."
