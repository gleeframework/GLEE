"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  It's a fair price, and I believe we can both walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing both of us to make a good deal.  Let's close this deal and move on.",975000.0,Bob,4,
