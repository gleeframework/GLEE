Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and the deal to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By not starting at my minimum, I create a space for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm losing out immediately. 
* **Prepared to walk away:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150, which sets my floor for acceptable offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150, and even lower than what John is willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. Rejecting it allows me to counteroffer and hopefully find a middle ground closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining my position:**  Accepting Bob's offer would be a significant loss. Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed option, so I can afford to be firm in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $145? This still allows me to make a fair profit, and I think it's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and counteroffer:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but present a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price. This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I emphasize that $145 is a ""great deal"" for both of us, framing it as a win-win situation.
* **Remaining firm but flexible:** I'm firm on the price, but still leaving room for further discussion if necessary. This gives Bob the impression that there's still potential for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. I'd be willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $110 is significantly below my minimum price of $150 and well below the compromise price I offered. 
* **No room for further negotiation:** Bob's persistence with low offers indicates he is not willing to meet my minimum requirements. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 ensures I receive my minimum price and avoid further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Further rounds of negotiation are unlikely to yield a satisfactory price, and I can secure a sale with John without any further effort."
