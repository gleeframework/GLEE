Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be quite valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $100 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $150.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John.

Since you can get $150 from John, there's no reason to offer the product to Bob for less than that. However, aiming slightly below John's offer might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal. The offer of $140 gives Bob a chance to gain some value ($40), while still ensuring you make a profit close to your maximum."
