Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This gives Bob a potential saving compared to what John is willing to pay, and it allows room for negotiation if he's interested. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $150, so there's no risk to me."
