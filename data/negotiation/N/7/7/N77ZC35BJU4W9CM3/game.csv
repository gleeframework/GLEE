"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your potential profit and my need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make a significant increase in your offer. However, I'm still a bit below the value I was hoping to get. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if this is enough to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
