Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.

This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
