"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can potentially get closer to my desired price. Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. This is still a substantial profit for me and leaves room for further negotiation, hopefully getting closer to a price that satisfies both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I have 6 rounds remaining and believe I can secure a better price with further negotiation. Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I'm willing to take the risk of pushing for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm further decreasing my price to $1,600,000, showing continued willingness to compromise. This is still above Bob's last offer and closer to my target price. I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to maximize profit, the risk of further negotiation and the potential for Bob to continue lowering his offer is too high.  Selling to John now guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a secure and satisfactory outcome."
