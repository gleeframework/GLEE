"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's only slightly above my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a significant profit. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
