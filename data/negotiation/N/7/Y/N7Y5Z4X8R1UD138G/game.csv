"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to me and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
