Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below his perceived value leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the final selling price. 
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing John offers a safety net at $1,200,000 allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob. 

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario while acknowledging the potential for negotiation and ensuring a profitable outcome."
