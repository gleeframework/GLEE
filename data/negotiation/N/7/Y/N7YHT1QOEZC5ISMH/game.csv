"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter offer, I appreciate the movement. How about we settle at $600,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you at $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",650000.0,Alice,5,
