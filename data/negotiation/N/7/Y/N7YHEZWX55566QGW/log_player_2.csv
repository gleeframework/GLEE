Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1050000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1150000? This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
