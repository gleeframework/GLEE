**Reasoning:**

Bob has been firmly rooted at $1,100,000 for several rounds, showing no willingness to budge closer to your price. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer means losing $100,000 compared to John's guaranteed price. 

At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob is a risk with little potential reward. It's more profitable to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
