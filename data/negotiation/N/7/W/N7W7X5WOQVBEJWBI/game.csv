"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get out of it.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $1,400,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
