Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm not willing to go above $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a final offer of $1,575,000. I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while you could try to squeeze out a bit more, risking losing him entirely for a difference of $25,000 is not worth it at this stage."
