"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with a price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position that allows for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me. I'm optimistic about getting a good price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I believe Bob might be willing to pay more, especially since he's already made a counteroffer. I'll see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise that still leaves room for negotiation but demonstrates my willingness to be flexible. I believe this price is fair given the product's value and Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd still like more, I'm starting to run out of time, and there's a risk that he might become less willing to negotiate further.  It's better to secure this price now than risk losing out to John or getting an even lower offer in the next round."
