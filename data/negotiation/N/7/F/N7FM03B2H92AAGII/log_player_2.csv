Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which I believe is a fair deal given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my target price while still giving you a good deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a good deal for you, Bob! Alice has come down significantly, and you're saving $1,750 compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal."
