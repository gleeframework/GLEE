"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which I believe is a fair deal given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my target price while still giving you a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",10250.0,Alice,5,
