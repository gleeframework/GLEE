"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $9,500 is still too low for me, considering my minimum is $8,000 and the product is worth more to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which I believe is a fair deal given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $10,000 is closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my target price while still giving you a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
