"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $140 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable premium compared to its market value of $120. I trust this offer will be favorable and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and you know John will sell it for less. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer."
