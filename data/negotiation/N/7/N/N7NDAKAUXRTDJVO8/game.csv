"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let me think for a moment... I can do $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $1,250,000. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
