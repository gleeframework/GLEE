"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no reason to accept the offer at this point, as he can get the product from John for the same price.  By rejecting, Bob opens the door for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This is a bold move, but it's important to show Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better deal. It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer right away, but it sets a strong foundation for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better. He's already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility by lowering her price. Continuing the negotiation could potentially lead to a price closer to his desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his initial strategy of pushing for a price close to his target. He's increasing his offer slightly from $12,000 to $12,500, showing he's willing to compromise but still wanting a significant discount. This counteroffer demonstrates his commitment to getting a good deal without being overly aggressive."
