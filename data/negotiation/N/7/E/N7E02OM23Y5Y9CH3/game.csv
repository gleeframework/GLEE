"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
