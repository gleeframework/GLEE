"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 right now.  This is my maximum budget, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  How about $1200000?  This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we can make this deal work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, $1200000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value I want to get out of this deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
