# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget, but it's getting closer.  Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.  You still have some room to work with before needing to buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  How about $1,200,000?  This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, $1200000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value I want to get out of this deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is still above your budget of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, the risk is that Alice could walk away from the deal.  To avoid this, it's safer to take the guaranteed deal with John at $1,000,000."
