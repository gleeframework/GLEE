"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $100? It's still a great price for a product worth so much more, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I understand your budget, but $92 just won't work for me.  How about $95? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to move on.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $95, which would be $92.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",92.5,Bob,8,
