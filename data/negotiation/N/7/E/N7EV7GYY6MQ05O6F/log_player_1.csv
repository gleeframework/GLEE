"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a higher price from Bob or sell to John for $120.  I'll see if I can negotiate closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $100? It's still a great price for a product worth so much more, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my goal. I might be able to secure a slightly higher price from Bob, or if all else fails, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $92 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my minimum.  I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob or sell to John for $120. I'm going to make one last counteroffer before deciding whether to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I understand your budget, but $92 just won't work for me.  How about $95? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to move on."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $95, which would be $92.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm running out of time and I'm confident that I can get my minimum price from John."
