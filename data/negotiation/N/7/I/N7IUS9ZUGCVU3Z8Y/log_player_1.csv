"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant markup but it allows for negotiation room. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay more than the minimum I need."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $10,500.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one.  It's still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I have a few rounds left, so I'll see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm counter-offering at $10,250. This is another compromise, closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while also getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are at round 6, and Bob is still unwilling to meet my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to get more, the negotiation is taking too long, and I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal."
