Bob should reject the offer.  $950,000 is still too high for him, and he has a better option available."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a fair compromise that considers both of our interests.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than the initial offer, $900,000 is still more than what he is willing to pay. He can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy the product from John for $800,000."
