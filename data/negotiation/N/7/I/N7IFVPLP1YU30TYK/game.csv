"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a fair compromise that considers both of our interests.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still only able to offer $875000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's also within my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
