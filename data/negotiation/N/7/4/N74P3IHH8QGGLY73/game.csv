"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to negotiate, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $800,000.  What would you say to a price of $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value I know you place on the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can agree on it.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
