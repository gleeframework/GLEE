"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some bargaining power and makes it less likely Bob will immediately reject the offer.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob feel valued and increases the chances he'll engage in negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states I'm open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response. 
* If he accepts, great!
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the next round. 
* If the negotiations stall or seem unproductive, I'll consider selling to John for the guaranteed $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, which gives me ample time to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is a Backstop:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I always have the option of selling to John for $120, ensuring I at least meet my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer closer to my initial price. 
* I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response, but I won't budge below my minimum acceptable price.
* If negotiations stall, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $95.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for further negotiation. This shows I'm willing to compromise while also maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** I'm not dropping to his price yet, indicating that I believe the product is worth more.
* **Positive Language:** Using positive language like ""Let's find a price that works for both of us"" encourages cooperation and helps maintain a good rapport with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* If he accepts, I will close the deal.
* If he rejects, I will need to determine if I can afford to drop my price further or if it's time to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm really hoping to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob. We're both showing a willingness to compromise, and there's still time to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding the ""Sell to John"" Trap:**  Selling to John right now would guarantee $120, but it risks losing out on a potentially higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make another counteroffer, likely somewhere between $90 and $95, trying to inch closer to Bob's price without going below my minimum.
*  I'll continue to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If negotiations continue to stall or Bob becomes less flexible, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $92? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making a small concession by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price above my minimum. This shows that I'm willing to compromise without giving up too much.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, which can help justify my price.
* **Encouraging Closing:**  My message suggests that we are close to a deal and encourages Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully monitor Bob's response.
* If he accepts, I'll close the deal.
* If he rejects, I'll assess the situation:
    * If he counteroffers with a price close to $92, I might accept to close the deal.
    * If he counteroffers significantly lower, I'll need to decide if I'm willing to lower my price further or if it's time to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92 is closer but still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to go down to $88?  That would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, his offer of $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be cautious about accepting a price that's too low.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob is demonstrating a desire to make a deal. It's possible he might be willing to go higher in the next few rounds.
* **Risk of ""Sell to John"" Regret:**  If I sell to John now, I might regret it if I could have gotten a slightly higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer, likely somewhere between $88 and $92, trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on.
* I'll continue to monitor Bob's willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If negotiations stall or Bob becomes less flexible, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $88 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?  That's a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a significant concession, moving closer to Bob's offer. However, I'm still holding out for a price that's slightly above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a ""good compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Encouraging Closing:** I'm again mentioning the possibility of closing the deal to create urgency.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll close the deal and be happy with the outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation:
    * If he counteroffers with a price close to $90, I might accept.
    * If he counteroffers significantly lower, I'll likely sell to John as time is running out and I'm getting closer to my minimum price.
    * If he doesn't counteroffer, I'll likely sell to John."
