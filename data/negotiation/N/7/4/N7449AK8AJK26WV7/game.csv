"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $95.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  ",95.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $92? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92 is closer but still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to go down to $88?  That would be a good compromise.",88.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $88 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?  That's a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,7,
