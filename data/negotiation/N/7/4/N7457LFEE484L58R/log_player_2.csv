"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $120.  It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to come down to $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum budget, it's still above your desired price point. There's still room to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially save more money."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but $117.50 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet at $122.50.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $122.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $120.
