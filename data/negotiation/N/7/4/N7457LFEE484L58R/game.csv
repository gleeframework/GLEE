"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to come down to $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but $117.50 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet at $122.50.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $122.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $120.  I'm sure you understand that this is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to sell the product and me to acquire it within my budget.",120.0,Bob,6,
