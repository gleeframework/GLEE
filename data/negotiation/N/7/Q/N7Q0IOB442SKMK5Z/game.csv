"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $170?  It's a high-quality product that you won't regret.",170.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $170 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but no more. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
