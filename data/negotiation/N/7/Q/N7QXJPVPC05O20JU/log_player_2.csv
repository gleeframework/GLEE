"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it and I'm happy to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is higher than her own value of the product ($800,000), it's still lower than your value for the product ($1,000,000) and lower than the price John would sell it to you for. Accepting her offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
