"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9,000?  This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $8,750? This is the highest I'm willing to go.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm eager to make this deal happen. However, $8,750 is still a bit too far from my desired price. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product for you. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
