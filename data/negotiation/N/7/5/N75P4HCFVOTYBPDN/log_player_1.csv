Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit more than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.
* **John as leverage:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity to counteroffer:**  I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer. 
* **John as a backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9,000?  This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to my goal:**  $9,000 is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get and making the offer sound appealing.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While $9,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John for $10,000 and leaving money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $8,750? This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000.
* **One last counter-offer:** I'm willing to make one more counter-offer to see if we can reach a compromise. 
* **John is still the backup:**  If Bob rejects my next offer, I will sell to John to ensure I get my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm eager to make this deal happen. However, $8,750 is still a bit too far from my desired price. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final counteroffer:** I'm presenting this as my final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Compromise and value:** $9,250 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still maintains a decent profit for me.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** The message emphasizes my willingness to make this deal work and highlights the value Bob will gain from the product. 
* **John is the backup:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob at a better price."
