Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob feel valued.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the ""great deal"" aspect, trying to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth further negotiation.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* If the negotiation stalls, I'll be ready to sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my max is $125.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, his message indicates interest in the product. This creates an opportunity for further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, hopefully finding a compromise that works for both of us. 
* **Strategic Counter:** My counteroffer will be carefully chosen, considering the potential for further negotiations and my willingness to sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $125 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $150? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($125). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the ""great deal"" aspect, reminding Bob of the value proposition.
* **Fair Profit:** I justify my offer by stating it allows me to make a ""fair profit,"" which is true given my minimum acceptable value is $150.

**Next Steps:**

* **Hopeful Acceptance:** I hope Bob will accept this offer, as it represents a fair compromise.
* **Prepare for Rejection:**  If Bob rejects again, I'll have to consider a lower offer, but I'll still aim for a price above my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Ready to Sell to John:** If the negotiation continues to stall, I'm prepared to sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose money."
