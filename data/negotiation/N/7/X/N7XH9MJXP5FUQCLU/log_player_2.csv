"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,300,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget.  He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat?  Would you be willing to go up to $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his target.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to go to $950,000. This represents a significant step closer to your position, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
