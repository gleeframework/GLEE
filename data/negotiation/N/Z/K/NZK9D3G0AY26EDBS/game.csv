,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. This product is worth $12,000 to me, but I'd like to find a price that works for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay $8,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,000, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm still trying to make a profit on this deal, and I believe this price is more in line with the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to meet you in the middle. I'm offering $9,400 for the product.  Let's finalize this deal in this round.",9400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I still think $9,400 is a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can get closer to that number.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only comfortable with $9,600.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement in this round. Let's make it happen.",9600.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,600, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking $10,200 is a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can make it work.",10200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this right now. Let's make this happen.",9800.0,Bob,10,
