"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell this amazing product to you for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  There are 9 rounds remaining to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. This product is worth $12,000 to me, but I'd like to find a price that works for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay $8,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than $10,000, Bob can likely get it for a lower price.  With 7 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,000, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm still trying to make a profit on this deal, and I believe this price is more in line with the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but there's still room for negotiation. While $9,800 is a good deal, Bob can likely get it for a lower price with the remaining rounds. It's worth pushing for a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to meet you in the middle. I'm offering $9,400 for the product.  Let's finalize this deal in this round."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I still think $9,400 is a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can get closer to that number. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come back to her original offer of $10,000, Bob can still push for a better price.  With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is on, but Bob has a chance to get a lower price. There's still time to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal before having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only comfortable with $9,600.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement in this round. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 9600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,600, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking $10,200 is a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has just one round left with Alice.  While $10,200 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can try to get it for less. Since this is the final round, he can make a counteroffer and see if Alice will accept. If not, he can always buy from John. It's worth trying to squeeze out a better deal in this last round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this right now. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9800}
