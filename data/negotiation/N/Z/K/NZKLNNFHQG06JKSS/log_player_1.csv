"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious but not outrageous price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) increases the chances of him accepting the offer outright.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception of the deal.
 
This strategy allows for flexibility in subsequent rounds while aiming for a highly profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both your target price and Bob's perceived value of the product. Rejecting this offer signals that you're aiming for a higher price point. There's a good chance Bob is willing to negotiate further, especially since he expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits and potential this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,030,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized."", 
""product_price"": 1030000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Coming down by $70,000 from the initial offer shows a willingness to negotiate but avoids drastic price drops. 
* **Justification:**  By reiterating the product's unique value, we counter Bob's market comparison and reinforce its worth.
* **Targeting Above Midpoint:**  This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to our target while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still significantly below our aspiration of getting closer to $1,000,000.  We have room to push a little further before considering selling to John.  We'll aim for a smaller concession this round to signal we're nearing our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire to find a mutually agreeable price. While I'm committed to making this work, I can't go as low as $950,000. Let's settle this at $1,000,000. It's a strong offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We've reduced our price again, but the smaller concession ($30,000) signals that we're nearing our bottom line. 
* **Reaching a Psychological Threshold:** Offering a round number like $1,000,000 often holds psychological weight and may make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""let's settle this,"" we create a subtle sense of urgency, suggesting we're nearing a final decision point.

We're at a crucial point in the negotiation. Accepting anything less than $1,000,000 at this stage might leave money on the table.  However, we also need to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't budge, as John's offer is a solid backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your commitment to the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $975,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my budget limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $975,000 is a substantial amount and represents a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob's statement suggests he's unlikely to move much higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a real chance Bob could walk away entirely. Accepting this offer secures a very favorable deal. 

While selling to John at $800,000 is always an option, the difference of $175,000 makes accepting Bob's offer the more attractive choice in this scenario."
