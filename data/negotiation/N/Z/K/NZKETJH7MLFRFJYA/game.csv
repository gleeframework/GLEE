"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $14000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12000. If this is not acceptable, I may have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
