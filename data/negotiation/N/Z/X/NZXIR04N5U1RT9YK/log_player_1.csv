Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's worth this much to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning it's worth $10,000 to you, you anchor the value in Bob's mind and provide a reason for the high asking price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Showing flexibility encourages Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $8,000, aiming higher with Bob could maximize your profit."
