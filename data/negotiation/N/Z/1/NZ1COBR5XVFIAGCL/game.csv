"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this works for you!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,500? That would really help me out.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $9,500? This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
