"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its potential benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value:**  You're only willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is $14,000. 
* **You want to negotiate:** You have room to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** By starting with a lower price, you immediately show Alice that you're serious about negotiating. This helps establish your bargaining position. 
* **Reasonable Price:**  $12,000 is still above Alice's value of $10,000, giving her room to potentially accept. 
* **Negotiation Space:** This offer leaves room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This is a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your value:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than your maximum of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** You have room to negotiate further. Even though Alice met you halfway, you can still try to push for a lower price. 
* **Avoiding unnecessary expense:**  Buying from John at $15,000 is a last resort if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** The offer is a slight increase from your previous $12,000 offer, showing you're willing to compromise but not giving in completely.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer positions you halfway between your previous offer and Alice's last offer, further demonstrating your willingness to negotiate fairly.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  $12,500 is still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
