"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000) and also lower than the price John is selling for ($1,500,000).  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $300,000."
