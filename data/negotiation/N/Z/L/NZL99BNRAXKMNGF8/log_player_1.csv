"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, which is a good starting point considering the product is worth $150 to Bob and $120 to me. I'm aiming for a good deal, but also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $140.  I have 9 rounds left, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? That would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $135. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to accept $132.50, I'm confident we can get closer to my target of $135. I'm willing to keep negotiating, and I still have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're close to a deal.  Let's aim for $134.  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for you too."", ""product_price"": 134} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $133, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $133? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $133.  We've reached a good compromise, and it's getting close to my desired price.  There's a chance I could get a little higher in the next rounds, but the risk of Bob rejecting further offers or walking away altogether is increasing. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing out on the sale."
