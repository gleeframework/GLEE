Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and it's worth $15,000  considering the value it offers. How about we start the negotiation at $14,000? "", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. This product is truly valuable, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects its worth.  Would you consider $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,500, which is $11,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to go as low as $9,000, but I need you to meet me at that price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is stubbornly lowballing and unlikely to go above $10,000.  It's time to take John's guaranteed offer."
