Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. This product is truly valuable, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects its worth.  Would you consider $12,500?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to push the price down even lower. I'm not willing to go above $9,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,500, which is $11,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to go as low as $9,000, but I need you to meet me at that price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
