# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. It makes more sense to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. Would that work for you?

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his comfortable spending limit. It's better to try negotiating further with Alice or go with John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but I was thinking of a slightly higher price. How about $10200? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's counteroffer of $10,200 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While Bob is clearly interested in the product, it's time to cut his losses and go with the guaranteed offer from John."
