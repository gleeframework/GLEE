"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference and go with $9500? I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but I was thinking of a slightly higher price. How about $10200? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",10200.0,Alice,5,
