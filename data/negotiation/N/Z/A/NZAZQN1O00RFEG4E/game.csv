"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be a valuable asset to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While the product is good, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider something closer to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $11,500 is too far from where I need to be. If this product is going to work for you, I need to see at least $14,000. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is important to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500? That's the best I can do.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. How about we split the difference - $13,250 and we have a deal?",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're really close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $12,250, but that's absolutely my limit.",12250.0,Bob,8,
