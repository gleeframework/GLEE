"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. "", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so my counteroffer is $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance I could negotiate her down further, it's getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds.  It's safer to go with John's offer at this point and guarantee I get the product for my desired price."
