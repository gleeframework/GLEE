Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value Isn't Realistic:** In a real negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob's true valuation of the product ($12,000). 
* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations higher than your absolute minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher price.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly anchoring Bob's perception to a higher price point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is above Bob's valuation, it leaves space for him to counter-offer. You can then decide whether to negotiate down or stick closer to your minimum price, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
