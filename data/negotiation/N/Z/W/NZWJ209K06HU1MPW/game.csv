"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm offering it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $600000. Can you consider this offer?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but from my original offer of $1200000, not from the midpoint of that and $600000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1000000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, so I'll offer $900000. Can you consider this compromise?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would put the price at $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original target price of $600000, so I'll offer $800000. Can you consider this compromise?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1100000, which would put the price at $1050000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on a price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
