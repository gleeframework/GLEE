"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, as it's the maximum I'm willing to spend.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
