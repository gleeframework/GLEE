"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to go a bit higher?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and my previous offer of $110, which would be $102.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $102.50. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's my final offer. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll meet you at $105. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100, Bob. I think you know I'm not going to get a better offer than that from you. I'll make one last offer: $108. That's my final price. Take it or leave it.",108.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, but $108 is still too high for me. I've gone as low as I can. I think it's time for me to explore other options. I'll have to pass on this deal.",0.0,Bob,10,
