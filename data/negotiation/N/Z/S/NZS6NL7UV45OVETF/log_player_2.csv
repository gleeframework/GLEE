"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that is worth at least $1200000 to me. I believe its value to you could be even greater.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. Let's discuss a price that benefits us both.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense.  You can then buy from John for the same price, knowing that you've at least explored all options."
