"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'd like to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However,  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing  $1,225,000.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,175,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of this product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,150,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,150,000 and we can call it a deal?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be upfront â€“  $1,150,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To be candid, I have another interested buyer, but I believe this opportunity would be most beneficial for you.  My final offer is $1,180,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,180,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,160,000?",1160000.0,Bob,8,
