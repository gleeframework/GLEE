"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $130?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  $110 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.  Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,5,
