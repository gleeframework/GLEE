"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $950,000 is a significant sum, I believe the true value of this product is even higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I think this price reflects the value it will bring to your business while still being a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $1,000,000 is a fair price for both of us, considering the value it holds for me. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
