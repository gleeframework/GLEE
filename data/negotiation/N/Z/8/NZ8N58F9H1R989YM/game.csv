"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value of similar products. I'm open to negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is below my initial offer, it's a good starting point for our negotiation. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to recognize your position. This price still reflects the value of the product and its potential benefits. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,100,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value of similar products. I'm open to further negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued interest.  While $900,000 is a step closer, I'm still unable to go that low at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This price acknowledges your value proposition while ensuring I receive a fair return on this unique asset.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
