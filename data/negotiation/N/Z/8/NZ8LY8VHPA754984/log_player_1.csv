Round 6
Bob's offer:

This is a tricky situation. While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000, Bob's offer is still a good deal for me. It's a high price, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. Accepting Bob's offer is the most financially beneficial choice at this point.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
