"Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
