Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This keeps the negotiation dynamic and allows for a possible win-win situation. 

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $12,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,500 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a profit margin.  The message also reiterates the value of the product for Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500. Would you consider selling the product to me for $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $12,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it. It's a lot of effort for a sale that's far below what the product is worth to me.  John is offering me my desired price, and it's a better deal for me.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
