"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,500 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500. Would you consider selling the product to me for $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
