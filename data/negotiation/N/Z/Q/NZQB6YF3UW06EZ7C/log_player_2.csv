Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still within your budget of $120.  While you'd prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal with Alice and having to pay John's higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
