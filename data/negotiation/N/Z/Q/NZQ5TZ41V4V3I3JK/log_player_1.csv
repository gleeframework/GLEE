{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's worth even more to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $10,100.  That's a fair compromise that still gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10100}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit margin, and I'm getting closer to my target price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
