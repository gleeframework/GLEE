"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its high value and quality, I propose a price of $100 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the unique benefits and features that make this product stand out. I'm confident that you'll find it worth every penny. Please let me know if you have any questions or need more information about the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you have another option with John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal with Alice or fall back on buying from John for $120."
