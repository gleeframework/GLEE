"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  ",8000.0,Alice,3,
