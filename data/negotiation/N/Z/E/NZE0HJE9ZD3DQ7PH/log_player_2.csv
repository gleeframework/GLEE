"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower than $9,500 to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get a better deal than Alice's initial offer of $9,500. By offering $9,000, Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant price reduction. This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate without having to drop to her bottom line of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still better than buying from John for $10,000, and it's closer to Bob's desired price range. At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal, especially if Alice is unwilling to go any lower. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
