"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $800,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet. Bob will continue to negotiate with Alice to try and reach a price closer to his budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high for Bob.  He's already reached his limit in terms of how much he's willing to negotiate with Alice.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000, he will choose to buy from John to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
