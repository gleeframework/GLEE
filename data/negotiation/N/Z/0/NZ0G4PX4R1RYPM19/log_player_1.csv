Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true worth. I could consider coming down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise that values the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical decision."
