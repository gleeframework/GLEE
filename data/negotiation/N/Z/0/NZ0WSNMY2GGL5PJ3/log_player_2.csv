"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You value the product at $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is $950,000.  There's room for negotiation.
* **Buying from John is the worst option.** You'd be paying the highest price.
* **Rejecting and counteroffering gives you leverage.** You can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This shows you're serious about negotiating but also leaves room for compromise.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's a $100,000 difference between your offer and Alice's value. This gives her some wiggle room to accept, while still saving you money. 
* **Setting the tone:**  By making a bold counteroffer, you are putting pressure on Alice to make concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now more favorable.**  It's lower than her previous offer and closer to your desired price range.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your next offer. 
* **Buying from John is still too expensive.** It's a much higher price than Alice's current offer.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice as it saves you a significant amount of money compared to both John's offer and your initial counteroffer."
