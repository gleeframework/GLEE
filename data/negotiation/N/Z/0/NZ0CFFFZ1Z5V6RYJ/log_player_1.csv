Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** Mentioning the product's ""amazingness"" hints at its value without revealing my true cost. 

This strategy gives me a chance to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better price, while also providing a fallback option with John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's interest is positive, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees a profit, but I want to see if I can get more from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's more in line with my expectations, and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your interest!  $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Rationale:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but indicating it's too low while also showing flexibility.
* **Middle Ground:**  $115 is a compromise that's closer to my minimum acceptable price and still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Interest:**  A friendly tone and willingness to negotiate keep Bob engaged. 

This strategy aims to:
*  Get closer to my desired price. 
*  Signal that I'm serious about selling to Bob but won't settle for a price that's too low. 
*  Maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $115 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $90 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** While Bob is interested and willing to negotiate, his offers are consistently below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

This decision maximizes my profit in this scenario. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offers are consistently too low, and I'm not willing to compromise on my minimum price."
