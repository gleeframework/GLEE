"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $95.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $95 is less than your maximum budget, you can get a better price from John. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, or you can stick with buying from John for $100."
