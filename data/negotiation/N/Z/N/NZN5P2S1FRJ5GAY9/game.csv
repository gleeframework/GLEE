"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budgetary constraints, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This recognizes the product's worth while still offering you a substantial return on your investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budgetary constraints, I am unable to agree to $875,000. I propose a counteroffer of $800,000, which I believe is closer to the true value of the product and within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
