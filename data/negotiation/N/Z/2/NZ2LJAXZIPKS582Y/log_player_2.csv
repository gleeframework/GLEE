Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential impact.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this revised offer reflects a more accurate value and presents a fair opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the product's value. To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,200,000 from another interested buyer. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I'm confident this product can be more beneficial to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable compromise.
