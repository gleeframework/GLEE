"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,600,000. This offer reflects the asset's true worth and future potential.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth that much. I could offer you $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential impact.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this revised offer reflects a more accurate value and presents a fair opportunity for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm serious about buying this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. How about $950,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows how serious I am.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the product's value. To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,200,000 from another interested buyer. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I'm confident this product can be more beneficial to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,300,000 is really pushing my limit.  If this deal is going to work, we need to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's my absolute best offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
