Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves me with a profit.
* The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a positive note.

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a higher price to leave room for negotiation.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and aim to meet somewhere in the middle.
* If we can't reach an agreement, I have the option to sell to John, securing my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below the value the product holds to Bob ($8,000). 
* I need to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counter with a price that's still lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility while maintaining my bottom line.
* If Bob continues to offer low prices, I'll consider selling to John and securing a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000.  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000** is a compromise price. It's higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial offer and closer to the product's value to him ($8,000). 
* The message is still friendly and encourages negotiation while stating my firm position.

**Strategy:**

* By offering a compromise price, I show flexibility while still protecting my interests. 
* If Bob accepts, I'll secure a good deal. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counter again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $7,500 is a good compromise. It's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's closer to my counteroffer of $9,000, and more importantly, it's a profitable deal for me.
* I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, but considering the negotiation process and the potential risk of Bob rejecting future counteroffers, accepting his offer seems like the most sensible option.

**Strategy:**

* I'm choosing to accept the offer to ensure a sale and avoid further negotiation risks. 
* Although $7,500 isn't my ideal price, it's a satisfactory outcome, and I can move on to other opportunities."
