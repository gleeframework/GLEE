"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit below my desired price. Let's compromise at $100, which is fair for both of us. This way, you get a great product, and I get a price that reflects its value.",100.0,Alice,5,
