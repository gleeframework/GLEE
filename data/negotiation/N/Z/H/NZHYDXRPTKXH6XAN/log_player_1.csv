"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will bring you significant benefit. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This price reflects the quality and potential of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what I know Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** I'm framing the offer in terms of the product's value to Bob, which can encourage him to consider my offer more favorably.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going for the full $15,000 immediately, as it's likely Bob will counteroffer, and I want to avoid immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, there's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet.
* **Strategy:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than the value this product holds. To reflect both our needs, I'm willing to lower my price to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum.  This shows I'm serious about a deal, but also that I'm not giving away the product for a low price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential benefits he'll gain, to encourage him to see the worth in a slightly higher price. 
* **Fair compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and only $1,000 above his initial offer. 
* **Not meeting halfway:** While Bob claims to be meeting me halfway, this is not accurate. He is only moving up by $1,000 while I've already lowered my price by $2,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price than $11,000.  I'm not ready to settle for a low offer yet.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  While I'm willing to compromise, $11,000 simply doesn't reflect the real value of this product.  To show my willingness to reach a deal, I'm willing to go down to $11,500.  This is a fair price, and it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer by $500, but still staying above my minimum. This demonstrates my flexibility and desire to reach a deal.
* **Maintaining value:** I'm not completely dropping to Bob's price, reminding him that the product holds value.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I'm reframing the negotiation in terms of a win-win outcome, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and collaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to make one more compromise to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $10,800 is still significantly below my ideal price and only a small increase from his previous offer.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk settling for a price too low.
* **John's offer:** While I'd prefer to negotiate further with Bob, selling to John for $15,000 is becoming increasingly attractive. 
* **Next round strategy:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll be prepared to move closer to John's offer if Bob doesn't significantly increase his bid."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  To make a final attempt at a deal, I'm willing to drop to $11,200.  This price recognizes your needs while still reflecting the product's worth.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final attempt:** I'm making a final counteroffer, showing Bob I'm serious about a deal but also indicating that I'm nearing my limit.
* **Small compromise:** I'm only dropping my price by $300, showing I'm not giving away the product for a low price.
* **Alternative options:** I'm subtly hinting at John's offer, putting pressure on Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Decision point:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll strongly consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to make one more compromise to reach a deal.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited time:**  With only two rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate further and risk getting a lower price.
* **John's offer:** Selling to John for $15,000 is the best option at this point, ensuring I get a price I'm happy with.
* **Risk mitigation:** I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially getting a lower offer or no deal at all. 

I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000 to secure a favorable outcome."
