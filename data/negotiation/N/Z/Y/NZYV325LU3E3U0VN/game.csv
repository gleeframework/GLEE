,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $75?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's a compromise that gets me closer to my original price, but still gives you a good deal.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. How about $78? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $78. How about we meet at $81? It's a small step back from my original price, but still gets me a decent profit.",81.0,Alice,5,
