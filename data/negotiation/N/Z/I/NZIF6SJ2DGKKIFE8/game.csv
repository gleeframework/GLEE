"Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a very reasonable price. I understand this is a significant investment, so I'm starting at $2000000. This price reflects the incredible value and potential this product holds. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in [Product Name], but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum offer, reflecting the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in [Product Name] and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is simply not feasible for me. Considering the immense potential and unique features of this product, I believe a fair price would be $1700000. This price reflects the true value of this product and provides a reasonable return on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the value of this product, but $1700000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $800000 simply doesn't cover the investment and potential of [Product Name].  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop the price to $1400000. This offer is a significant compromise and demonstrates my desire to work with you.  I believe this price represents a fair value for both of us, allowing you to maximize your investment and me to secure a reasonable return. Let's find a solution that benefits both parties.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in [Product Name] and your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1000000 is still significantly below the value I've placed on this product. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to drop my price to $1300000.  This price reflects a considerable compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement that benefits both parties.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen.  If not, I'll need to consider other options.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
