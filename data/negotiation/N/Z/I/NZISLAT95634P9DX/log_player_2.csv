Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $18,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this brings.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $10,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to accept $16,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $16,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
