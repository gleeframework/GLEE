"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range where there's room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $1,200,000, I'm allowing for multiple rounds of negotiation without immediately triggering a sale to John.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still $100,000 below my desired value. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I want to see if I can close the gap further. There's still room for me to counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my desired $1,000,000.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $1,000,000, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, especially since he has already shown interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000?  This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while also maintaining my leverage. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting the ""mutually beneficial"" aspect of the deal, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a good value while I'm still getting a price closer to my goal. 
* **Remaining Firm:** I'm not giving in completely to Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility and willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit below my target. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Even with Bob's increased offer, it remains $50,000 below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  There's still some room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get a price closer to my minimum by counteroffering.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, I'm not yet willing to give up on the potential for a higher price with Bob, considering he's shown increasing interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,000,000? This would meet my minimum while still being a fair price for the value you'd be getting.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, aiming for my minimum desired value.
* **Direct and Clear:** I've stated my price point directly, removing any ambiguity.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing the possibility of finalizing the deal, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.

**Considerations:**

* This round is crucial. If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John in the next round to secure my minimum value.
* The key is to balance firmness with the potential of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target, but I still need to make some room in my budget. How about $980,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:**  Bob's offer is only $20,000 below my minimum. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already made my final offer and signaled my unwillingness to go lower.
* **Time and Risk:**  With only four rounds remaining, the potential gains from further negotiation are limited.  The risk of Bob continuing to stall or making counteroffers that are even lower is high. 
* **Guarantee:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired $1,000,000, eliminating the uncertainty and risk of further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

It's a close call, but at this point, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price with Bob."
