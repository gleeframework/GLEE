Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (You'll sell to John at this price).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists, but it's small.  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work.

**Strategy**

You want to get as close to $1,499,999 as possible without pushing Bob away. Here's where negotiation tactics come in:

* **Information Scarcity:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.  Don't reveal this information.
* **Anchoring:**  Start with a high price to set the expectation. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and market potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its long-term benefits."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **High Anchor:** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation but keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording implies you're open to discussing the price further.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before walking away and selling to John."
