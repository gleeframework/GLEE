"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its actual worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250? That still gives you a good deal considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  I can offer you $11,500 for the product. That's a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum.  While I would prefer to get more, it's only $500 less than my previous counteroffer and I'm running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoid the risk of getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for $10,000."
