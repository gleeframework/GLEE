"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to secure the product for a slightly lower price. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider the value of the product and my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
