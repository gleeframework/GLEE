"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's offer is substantial and shows Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message highlights Bob's desire for a good price, but still acknowledges the value of the product.
* **Open to Compromise:**  ""Finding a middle ground"" shows flexibility and willingness to work towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $11,500 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000 and represents a substantial saving.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice's offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, suggesting a possibility of a successful negotiation.
* **Limited Time:**  While there's still room to negotiate, accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further rounds potentially resulting in a higher price or no deal."
