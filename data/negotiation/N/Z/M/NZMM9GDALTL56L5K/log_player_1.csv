I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $5,000, I believe the product is worth more than that.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $5,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This still leaves me some profit and hopefully is a fair price for you. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 7500}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $6,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're getting close with Bob, but I'm concerned that we're not going to be able to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  I'm guaranteed $8,000 from John, so it's the safer option at this point."
