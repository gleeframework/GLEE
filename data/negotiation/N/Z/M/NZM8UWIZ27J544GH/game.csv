"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,300,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for it, reflecting a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for countering. I see the value you place on the product, however, I'm confident it holds a higher value than your current offer reflects.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway and  reduce the price to $2,000,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,800,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while remaining within my budget.  I hope we can finalize this deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
