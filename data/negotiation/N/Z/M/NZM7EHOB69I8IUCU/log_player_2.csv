"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value for the product. This gives me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a price well below my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $95? I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a price closer to $95, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

I'm proposing a price directly in between our last two offers.  This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
