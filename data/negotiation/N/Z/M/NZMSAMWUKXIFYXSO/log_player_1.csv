"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $160  to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $160, you are ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value, it sets a frame of reference for the subsequent back-and-forth. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves ample room for you to come down in price over subsequent rounds,  potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 

Keep in mind, this is just the opening move.  How you proceed will depend on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. I'd like to propose a price of $120. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($100). You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and there's a good chance you can get a better offer from Bob. 

**Next Steps (Round 3 - Your Turn):**

You should counter-offer with a price between $120 and your original offer of $160. Aim to move closer to the middle ground, but don't concede too much too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer suggests a spirit of compromise, which can be helpful in negotiations.
* **Strategic Concession:** You've lowered your price by $20, signaling flexibility but maintaining a position above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counter-offer will help gauge how much Bob is truly willing to pay and how much further you might need to adjust your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $130. I hope this offer is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is above your minimum acceptable price of $100, giving you a profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the gains are likely to be small. Each round carries the risk of Bob walking away or you having to settle for an even lower price as you approach the deadline.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Holding out for a higher price from Bob means potentially missing out on a guaranteed $100 from John. 

It's a good deal!  Accept the offer and move on."
