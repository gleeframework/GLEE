"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice clearly values the product significantly less than your maximum price and significantly less than John's offer. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better deal from Alice."
