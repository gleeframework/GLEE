"I have a unique opportunity to sell you a high-quality product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. Could you do $11,000? That would work much better for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already met you halfway. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I can do $13,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",13000.0,Alice,5,
