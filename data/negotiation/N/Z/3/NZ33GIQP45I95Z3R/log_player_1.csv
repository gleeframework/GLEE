Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so aiming high initially makes sense.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This offer signals that you understand the product's value to Bob but are also being reasonable. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
