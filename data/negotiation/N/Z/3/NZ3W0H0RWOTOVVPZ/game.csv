"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1000000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is my final concession, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm not willing to go below $1000000, as that's my minimum price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to stay within my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $980000. This is my last concession, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",980000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to stay firm on my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $990000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",990000.0,Alice,9,
