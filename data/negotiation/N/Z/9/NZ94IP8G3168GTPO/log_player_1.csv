Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $100 gives us room to negotiate down. We know the product is worth at least $80 to us, so we have some buffer.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message signals flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer. This is important because we don't know how much he values the product.
* **Knowing our Exit:**  We have John as a backup buyer for $80, so we're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is below our minimum acceptable price of $80. We're not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is interested in the product, indicating there's room for negotiation.  
* **John as a safety net:**  We have a backup buyer in John who will pay $80, so we can afford to be firm with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we're serious about our price and open the door to counter-offers. This helps us get closer to our desired selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $60 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're meeting Bob halfway by reducing our price from $100 to $85. This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting our profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Clear Offer:** We're stating our counteroffer price explicitly, leaving no room for ambiguity.

This counteroffer balances our need to earn a decent profit with the desire to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! I'm still a bit hesitant at $85, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $75. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below our minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to our minimum price, it's still below our $80 minimum.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** We're not sure if we can convince Bob to go higher.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John guarantees us our minimum price. 

Since we have a reliable backup buyer in John, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob. We can secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John."
