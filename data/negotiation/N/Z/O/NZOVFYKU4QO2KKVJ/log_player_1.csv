"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000 offer:** This is a starting point that is significantly lower than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm aiming for a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:** Mentioning ""valuable asset"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a cautious approach by starting with a relatively low offer, but one that's still within my acceptable range. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and leaves room for him to counteroffer. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my subsequent offers based on his response, aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible within the 10 rounds.  The option to sell to John at any point provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail to reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,200,000).**  While he's showing interest, this offer is unacceptable.
* **Selling to John is my backup plan.**  I want to explore further negotiation with Bob before resorting to this option.

**Strategy:**

I'll use this rejection as an opportunity to adjust my strategy.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, keeping in mind Bob's willingness to negotiate but also ensuring I'm not giving away too much value.  This will help me get a better sense of his maximum offer and potentially find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my absolute lowest price. This product is truly unique and will give you a significant competitive edge. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I've lowered my price by $100,000, signaling my willingness to negotiate, but still staying above my minimum value.
* **Emphasize value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's unique benefits helps justify the price and encourages him to consider the long-term value.
* **Collaborative tone:** Using phrases like ""find a way to make this work"" promotes a spirit of cooperation and helps keep the negotiation positive.

**Strategy:**

By taking a step towards Bob's offer while maintaining my minimum value, I aim to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to compromise increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Gauge Bob's reaction:**  This counteroffer will tell me whether he's willing to meet me halfway. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting his initial low offer, I preserve my position and can potentially negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value it brings to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000.** While he's moving closer, it's not yet acceptable.
* **Selling to John remains a viable option.**  I'm still exploring negotiation with Bob, but I'm not giving up too much value yet.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer again, but I will move closer to Bob's offer to try and find a middle ground. It's important to be firm, but also show a willingness to negotiate. I will aim for a price that is closer to my minimum value while still leaving some room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $812,500? This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've proposed a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($725,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Focus on compromise:** I use phrases like ""split the difference"" and ""fair compromise"" to highlight the collaborative nature of the negotiation.
* **Reiterate benefits:** Briefly reminding Bob of the product's value can help justify the price and encourage him to see it as a worthwhile investment.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  Demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Gauge Bob's willingness to compromise:** If he rejects this offer, it suggests he may be unwilling to budge further.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still above my minimum value, leaving room for further negotiations if needed.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have a clearer understanding of his maximum offer and can adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if the price doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $812,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000 as my final offer. This allows me to gain value from the product while ensuring a fair deal for you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000.** Although he's getting closer, it's still not acceptable.
* **Selling to John remains a safe option.** I'm running out of rounds, but I'm determined to get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer one more time, aiming for a price that is significantly closer to my minimum value. This will be my last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I will sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, and I appreciate your commitment to making this deal work.  However,  $750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum requirement. To make this happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This allows for a fair profit for me while still giving you a valuable asset.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've lowered my price significantly from the previous round, but it's still above my minimum value and reflects the product's worth.
* **Finality:**  I've made it clear that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to reconsider.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price and highlight the benefits for Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the waters:** This offer is a gamble, but it allows me to see if Bob is serious about closing the deal. If he rejects, I will sell to John.
* **Minimizing loss:**  While $1,000,000 is lower than my ideal price, it's still a significant gain compared to selling to John.
* **Negotiating leverage:** By setting a final deadline and emphasizing the value, I'm hoping to pressure Bob into accepting.

This round is crucial. If Bob rejects this offer, I will have no choice but to sell to John and accept the guaranteed $1,200,000."
