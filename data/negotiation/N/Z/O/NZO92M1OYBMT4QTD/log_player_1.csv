Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $95. I believe it's of great value and you'll be very satisfied with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to potentially secure the highest possible profit.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a price range favorable to you. 
* **Consider Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so $95 offers him a perceived discount while still earning you a significant profit.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have a single opportunity to offer the product to Bob. If you had multiple rounds to negotiate, the approach might change."
