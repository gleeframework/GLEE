Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

My reasoning:

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $149 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down, while still staying very profitable for me.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** By presenting it as a ""great deal,"" I'm subtly implying that he shouldn't miss out.

Even if Bob rejects this offer, I'm guaranteed to sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
