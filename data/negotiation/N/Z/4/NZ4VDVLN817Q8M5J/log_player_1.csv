Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This allows for a fair profit for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting lower, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below $1 million. It's better to sell to John now and secure my minimum price."
