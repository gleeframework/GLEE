"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to bargain upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's enthusiasm but firmly states your budget limitations.
* **Aiming for Savings:** While your maximum is $80, aiming lower initially increases your chances of securing a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $100 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice is coming down, $100 is still significantly above your $80 maximum and your desired price point.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to compromise suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to go with John if the negotiations don't yield a favorable price soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $75?"", 
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** $75 represents a reasonable middle ground between your initial offer ($60) and Alice's counteroffer ($100).
* **Direct Approach:** The message keeps the negotiation moving forward by suggesting a specific price. 
* **Staying Below Maximum:** This counteroffer ensures you stay within your $80 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the idea of meeting in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $75. How about we aim for $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Limit:** While $90 is closer to your $80 maximum, it's still above your ideal price, and you're getting close to your limit.
* **Time for Leverage:**  With several rounds left, you can use the John option as leverage. 
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:** Rejecting this offer might encourage Alice to make a more significant concession in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I've been considering other options, and to be honest,  $80 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works for you, I'm ready to buy right now."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is a strategic move to present your maximum price as a firm offer. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other options"" and your readiness to buy adds a level of urgency and encourages Alice to decide quickly.
* **Not Exceeding Budget:**  The offer ensures you don't go over your $80 limit.
* **Potential for Success:** While there's no guarantee Alice will accept, it's a strong negotiating position that could lead to a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is the highest you can go, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to have to counteroffer again. How about we meet at $95? It's still a bit higher than your maximum, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unlikely to go below $95. You've reached your maximum price, and further negotiation seems unlikely to bridge the gap.
* **Time is Money:** You've spent several rounds negotiating, and continuing might not yield a better result. It's better to secure the product now at a price you know works.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John offers a guaranteed price of $80, saving you money and avoiding further negotiation."
