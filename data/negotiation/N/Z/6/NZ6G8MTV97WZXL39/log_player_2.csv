"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm offering it to you for $95.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice.  $95 is a bit too high, but the product is likely worth more to Alice than to you.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $90, but that's my final offer.  I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still higher than I'd prefer, it's a good deal compared to buying from John.  Let's accept and move on."
