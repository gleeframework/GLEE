"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider $7,000? I feel that's a reasonable price for the product.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I see where you're coming from, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $7,000. Perhaps we can settle on $8,750? This keeps us close to our previous middle ground.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting closer!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, how about $7,500? That's the best I can do.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. How about we split the difference one last time and call it $8,125?  That's my final offer.",8125.0,Alice,7,
