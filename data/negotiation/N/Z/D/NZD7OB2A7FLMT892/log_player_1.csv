"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is quite low, and there's room for negotiation. It's too early to settle for his price or John's offer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider $7,000? I feel that's a reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I see where you're coming from, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $7,000. Perhaps we can settle on $8,750? This keeps us close to our previous middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, this is getting closer!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, how about $7,500? That's the best I can do.
