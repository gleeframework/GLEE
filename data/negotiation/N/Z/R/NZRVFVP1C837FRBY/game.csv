"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $11,000? It's still a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's try to work something out.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe we can find common ground. I would like to propose $10,500 for your product. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. I hope you can consider this offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. While I appreciate your offer, $10,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $10,800, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, you need to meet me halfway.",10800.0,Alice,5,
