"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product with immense value. My initial price is $1800000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's potential. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford $1800000. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is far below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, but I can't go any lower. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1400000 is still outside of my budget.  I can offer you $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my ability to pay. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still not a price I can accept. The product's true value is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1200000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product to you, but $1200000 is still a stretch for me.  I can go up to $1100000.  This is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
