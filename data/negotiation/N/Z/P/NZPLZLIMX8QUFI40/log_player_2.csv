Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is far below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, but I can't go any lower. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,400,000 is still outside of my budget.  I can offer you $1,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still not a price I can accept. The product's true value is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1200000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
