Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $102.50?  That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $102.50, which would be $96.25. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $96.25 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $96.25 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle one more time.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell you the product without having to go through John."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to go up to $98, but no higher. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, $100 is still above my minimum and I don't want to risk further negotiation."
