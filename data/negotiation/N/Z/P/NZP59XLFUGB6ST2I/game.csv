"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $85 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $95,  which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $95 is better, I'm still aiming for a bit more.  How about $115? This is my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you saying this is your final offer, but $115 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Bob,6,
