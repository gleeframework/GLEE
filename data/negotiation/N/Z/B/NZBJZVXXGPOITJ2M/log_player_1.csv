Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a little lower than what you could get from John, but it still gives you a good profit and leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob.  If Bob accepts, you make $4000. If he rejects, you can move on to John and secure the $15,000.  This strategy balances maximizing your profit with minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
