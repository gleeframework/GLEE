"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 feels fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,300,000 is far outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant amount and a good starting point for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has incredible value that will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
