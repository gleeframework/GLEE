"Alice, thank you for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is at the very top of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1000000? I believe this is still a fair price for a unique product like this and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
