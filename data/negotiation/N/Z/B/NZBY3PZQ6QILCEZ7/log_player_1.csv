Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is at the very top of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1000000? I believe this is still a fair price for a unique product like this and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
