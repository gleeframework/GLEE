"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as it's worth significantly more to you than that.  While I'm confident in the value I'm offering, I'm open to discussing the price further. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, while John wants $1,500,000. 
* **You're still saving money:**  Even though Alice's offer is above your initial value ($1,200,000), it's still lower than what you'd pay John. This means you're saving $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
