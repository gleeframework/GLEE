"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. It's a steal at this price, considering what you could get out of it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $11,500 is a decent price, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, so it's worth seeing if you can save a bit more money."
