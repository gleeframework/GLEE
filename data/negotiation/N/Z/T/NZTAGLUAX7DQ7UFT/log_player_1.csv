Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I open it up to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While John guarantees $1,200,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering it at Bob's value ($800,000) is unlikely to work. Offering it near your own value ($1,200,000) might scare Bob off. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant profit margin above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:**  The mention of ""other potential buyers"" subtly reminds Bob he's not the only option, potentially encouraging him to act quickly."
