Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to discuss the price, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome above our minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" we try to shift Bob's focus from the price to the potential benefits, increasing his perceived value.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product. If he rejects the initial offer, we can always lower the price slightly or accept John's offer."
