The offer from Alice is way above your budget. It makes more sense to counteroffer or explore John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

This is a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within your budget. It gives Alice room to negotiate but also demonstrates that you are serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your limit.  While it's closer, John's offer guarantees you the product at a price you are comfortable with. It's a safer option to secure the product from John."
