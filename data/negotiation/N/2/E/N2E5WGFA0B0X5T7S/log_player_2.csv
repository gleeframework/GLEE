{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting further away from Bob's desired price. With only 3 rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price is getting slimmer. Buying from John at $120 guarantees Bob the product while still staying within his budget.  It's time to cut the negotiation short."
