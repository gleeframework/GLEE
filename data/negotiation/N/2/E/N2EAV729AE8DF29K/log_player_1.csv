Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth $180, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $160. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's value is $100, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appearing Flexible:**  By saying ""willing to offer,"" you subtly imply you might be open to a counter-offer, encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Justification:** Mentioning your perceived value ($180) provides a reason for the initial high price, making the $160 seem like a discount. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still leaving a chance for Bob to accept an offer above his perceived value. If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
