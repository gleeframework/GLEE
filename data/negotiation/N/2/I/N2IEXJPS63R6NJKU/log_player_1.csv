Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking of a price around $10,800. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $10,800 is still a bit low for me, even though I know he values the product at $10,000.  I think I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. Bob's offer of $10,900 is still too low for me. Even though I could continue to negotiate with Bob, I'm confident that I can get my desired price of at least $12,000 from John."
