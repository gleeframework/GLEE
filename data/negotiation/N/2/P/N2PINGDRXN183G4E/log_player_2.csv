"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $120. It's a great deal considering it's worth much more to me! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her perceived value, you can get the product for a much better price of $80 from John.  You should always choose the option that saves you the most money, which in this case is buying from John."
