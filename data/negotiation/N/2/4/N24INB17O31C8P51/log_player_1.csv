I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  We have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can achieve a more favorable outcome."

At this point, I'm going to sell to John.  Bob keeps coming down with lower offers, and even my counteroffer of $1,100,000 was rejected. We're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but it's not guaranteed. I'd rather take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
