Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 and guarantee the sale to John, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay slightly more than his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $149 is just below my guaranteed sale price and might seem like a ""deal"" compared to an even $150. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Slight):**  Although unlikely, the slightly lower price leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate up a dollar or two."
