"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $11,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is the best I can do for now.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,800. This is as low as I can go.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, $12,800 is still a little more than I'm ready to spend. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $11,500.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,200. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",12200.0,Alice,7,
