"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. The product is truly worth more than $1,050,000, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. How about we split the difference at $1,125,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500.  This would be a good compromise for both of us and allow us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1087500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,087,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to go down to $1,106,250, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects the value of the product and ensures a profitable outcome for both of us. What do you say?",1106250.0,Alice,5,
