"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a reasonable range considering the value to Bob ($100). 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, as it's likely Bob will want to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John is an option:** Knowing John is willing to pay $150 provides a safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $125 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's the midpoint between my minimum ($150) and Bob's offer ($125). This shows willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Fairness Focus:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
