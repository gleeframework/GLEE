"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $150 to Alice, and she is asking $175, which is too high for me. I will try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $125 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is willing to sell the product for $150, which is still more than I want to pay, but it's closer to my ideal price.  I'll take it."
