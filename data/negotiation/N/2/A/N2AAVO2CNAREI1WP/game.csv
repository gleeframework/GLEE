"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to sell for $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a reasonable compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll be moving on to another buyer. Let me know your decision.",8000.0,Alice,5,
