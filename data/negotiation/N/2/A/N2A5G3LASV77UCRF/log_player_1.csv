{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal given its potential value to you. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. This makes the final offer seem more reasonable by comparison.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering at $1,300,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, and Alice can afford to come down slightly while still remaining well above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's high value without revealing Alice's true bottom line. This can help nudge Bob towards accepting. 

**Important Note:**  While Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John, securing a deal with Bob quickly could be advantageous to avoid potential delays or complications."
