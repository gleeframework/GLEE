Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, not just covering your costs. 
* **It's not too high:**  A very high starting price might scare Bob away immediately. 
* **It's friendly:** You're building a rapport with Bob, which is important for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $100.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $125?  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $112.50 is closer to your minimum, it's still below it. Selling to John for $120 guarantees you a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob.  It's the most logical choice in this situation."
