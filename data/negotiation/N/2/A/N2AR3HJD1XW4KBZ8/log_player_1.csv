Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $15,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $15,000, Alice anchors Bob's perception of the value.
* **Time Pressure:**  Hinting at another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly. 
* **Potential for Profit:** Offering it at $18,000 gives Alice a potential $3,000 profit margin, significantly more than her guaranteed $15,000 from John."
