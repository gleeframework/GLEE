Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is more than fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer is significantly above your $1,200,000 minimum, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while keeping your fallback option with John secure."
