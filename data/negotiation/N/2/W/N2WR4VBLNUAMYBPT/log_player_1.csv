"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point for negotiation. It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for bargaining. This message is also friendly and invites Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar for less. How about we aim for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is above my minimum, it's still below my desired selling price, and there are rounds left to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm sticking to my initial strategy of starting high and gradually lowering the price.  I've come down from $100 to $95, which is a significant compromise. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I think $90 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $90 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum threshold and I'm getting closer to my desired price. It's also a fair compromise, considering the limited number of rounds remaining."
