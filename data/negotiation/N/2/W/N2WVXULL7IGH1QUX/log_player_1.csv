Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more willing to pay.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm phrasing the message in a way that suggests I'm open to discussion, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he's not happy with the initial price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still being open to reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're putting on the product. However,  I'm only able to go as high as $100 at this point. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my desired price:** While $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($80), it's not a good enough offer for me to accept. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he acknowledges the value of the product.
* **Minimizing loss:**  Selling to John for $80 would be a last resort, as it would be the least profitable option.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand you have a budget. However, $100 is a bit too low for me considering the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price slightly, but not too much. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit.
* **Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially making him more likely to accept.
* **Reinforcing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to strengthen my bargaining position.

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground and close the gap between our desired prices."
