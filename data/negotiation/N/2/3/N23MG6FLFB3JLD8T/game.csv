"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get out of this product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant deviation from my initial proposal.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to $1,050,000 is more reflective of that. Would you be open to considering this revised figure?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, and I appreciate the revised offer. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
