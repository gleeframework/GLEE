Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While $850,000 is a significant offer, it falls short of what I consider fair compensation. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This considers your budget constraints while reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which reflects a significant compromise on my end.  This price is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of your product while also remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my $1,000,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a fair price. It makes more sense to take the sure profit now rather than risk Bob not reaching my minimum acceptable price."
