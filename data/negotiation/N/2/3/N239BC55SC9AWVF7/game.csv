"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value you place on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While $850,000 is a significant offer, it falls short of what I consider fair compensation. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This considers your budget constraints while reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which reflects a significant compromise on my end.  This price is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of your product while also remaining within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
