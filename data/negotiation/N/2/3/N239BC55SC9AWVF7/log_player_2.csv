"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While $850,000 is a significant offer, it falls short of what I consider fair compensation. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This considers your budget constraints while reflecting the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm going to try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which reflects a significant compromise on my end.  This price is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of your product while also remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 950000}
