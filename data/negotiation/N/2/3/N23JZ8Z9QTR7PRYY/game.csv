"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to drop to $1,200,000, which is the minimum I can accept.  This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. Let's close the deal now.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
