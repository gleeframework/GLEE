"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love! I'm starting with a price of $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You don't know her bottom price, so rejecting the offer is the best first move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I understand.  $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $135?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $135 is closer to your goal, it's still above your initial target. You want to see if Alice will go lower, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $135 is still a bit too high for me. How about $130? I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
