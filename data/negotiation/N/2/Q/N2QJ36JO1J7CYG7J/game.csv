"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy the product for a price closer to its actual value. How about we meet in the middle?",650000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer, so I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to, but $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $750,000? That's a significant move on my part, showing how serious I am about buying this product.",750000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about buying the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $875,000, which is $812,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",812500.0,Alice,5,,
