Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for potential counteroffers.  I'm aiming for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my target. I believe I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum.  This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to find a solution while still protecting my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm really hoping to get this for $9,250.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target and is very close to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing this deal and potentially needing to sell to John for less.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and a successful negotiation."
