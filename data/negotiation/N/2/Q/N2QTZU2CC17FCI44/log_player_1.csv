Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While our initial offer is $1,150,000, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer. This leaves us with some wiggle room to potentially still secure a deal above our minimum.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, knowing we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000 gives us leverage and peace of mind."
