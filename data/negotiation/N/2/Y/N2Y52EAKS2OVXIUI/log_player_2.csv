"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, you can potentially get the product for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is halfway between my maximum price ($120) and Alice's minimum price ($100). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation and leaves room for both of us to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still within my budget and represents a better price than buying from John.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice may become less willing to compromise, or I might lose time and potentially miss out on the product altogether.  Accepting the offer guarantees I get the product at a reasonable price."
