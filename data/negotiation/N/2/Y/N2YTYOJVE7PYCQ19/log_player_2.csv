You can definitely get a better price than $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for some negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if she's willing to come down a bit."

While $130 is better than John's price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm offering $110. This is a fair compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. Hopefully, she'll accept this and we can finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like, but it's close enough to my budget.  It's better than buying from John for $150, and I don't think I'll be able to get her to go lower.  I'll accept her offer."
