"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to make the price seem more justifiable. 

This strategy aims to establish a starting point for negotiation while keeping the door open for a successful deal with Bob.  I'm also prepared to move to John if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $75 is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and only slightly above his perceived value of $100.  Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.  

I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $75 is far too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $125. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but still maintaining a profit margin. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make the price more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully close the deal with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to assess if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to go up to $90. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While he's shown a willingness to negotiate, it's not enough for me to accept at this point. 

I'm prepared to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more agreeable price. I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John for $150, but I want to exhaust the negotiation process with Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $90 is still too low for me.  Let's try $110.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistence:** I'm continuing to negotiate with Bob, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement with him.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm framing the price as a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.

This counteroffer aims to find a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being attractive to Bob. If he rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $100? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is a significant increase from his previous offers, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.  

I've already had several rounds of negotiations with Bob, and it's clear that we're not close to reaching a mutually agreeable price.  Since I have the opportunity to sell to John for $150, which meets my minimum requirement, I will choose to sell to John. This guarantees me a profitable outcome and avoids further potentially unproductive negotiation with Bob."
