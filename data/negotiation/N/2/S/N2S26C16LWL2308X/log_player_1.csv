Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise:

* It's higher than Bob's perceived value, increasing his incentive to accept.
* It's significantly lower than your minimum desired price, leaving room for negotiation if needed. 

This strategy allows you to:

* **Maximize your potential earnings:** You're aiming for a good price while still leaving room for compromise.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** A reasonable opening offer will encourage Bob to engage further.
* **Maintain your safety net:** You can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $15,000. Accepting Bob's offer would leave me with a significant loss.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm not pressured to accept a low offer. I'll counteroffer Bob to try and find a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not drastically lower my price. 
* **Counteroffer is still significantly lower than my minimum:** This leaves room for further negotiations while still ensuring a profitable sale for me.
* **Reasoning included:** This helps Bob understand my position and increases the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can we try $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so there's no urgency to settle for a low price.  I'll counteroffer Bob again, hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price before deciding whether to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. It's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not drastically lower my price.
* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum:** This reduces the gap between our desired prices.
* **Final offer statement:** This adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.

I'm trying to get as close to my minimum price as possible without risking losing Bob as a buyer. I'm hoping this final offer will be enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my desired price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept such a large loss. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids any further negotiation with Bob."
