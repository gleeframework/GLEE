Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum value I'm willing to spend on this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject her offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm starting to feel a little pressured, but I'll stick with my strategy for now."
