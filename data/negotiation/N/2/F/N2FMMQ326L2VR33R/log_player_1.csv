Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $9,500, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I believe this price is fair, considering your value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still gives you a great value, and it's a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise that's closer to my budget and still gives you a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept his offer. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of this negotiation. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,875.  It's a fair compromise for both of us, and it keeps this deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 8875}
