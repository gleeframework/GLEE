Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a risk. But if he's truly interested, he'll likely counteroffer, giving us a chance to negotiate. I'll keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $16,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can still get more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but be prepared to negotiate further.  I'll keep the option to sell to John in mind if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $17,000. This shows some flexibility and willingness to compromise. It also allows me to see how seriously Bob is interested in the product and if he's willing to meet me halfway. If he still refuses, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my price. At this point, I'm happy to accept his offer. It's a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal by pushing for more. While I could potentially get a few hundred dollars more, the risk of Bob walking away entirely isn't worth it."
