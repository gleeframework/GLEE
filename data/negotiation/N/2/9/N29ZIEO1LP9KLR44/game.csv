"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is still a good value for both of us, considering your asking price.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000 for the product. This is a reasonable price, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
