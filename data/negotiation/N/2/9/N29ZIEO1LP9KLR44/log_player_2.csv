"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  Bob should try to counteroffer and see if he can bring the price down closer to his target of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's target price, it's still a bit higher than he's willing to pay right now.  Since Bob has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, he's still in a good position to negotiate.  There's a good chance he can get Alice down to his desired price with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000 for the product. This is a reasonable price, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,075,000.  While it's closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than the $1,000,000 he can get from John.  Given that John is a guaranteed option at a lower price, Bob should take the deal with John and avoid further negotiations with Alice."
