Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $92.50. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a bit lower.  You have 5 rounds left, and you're still better off than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle at $91? That's a good deal for both of us and would leave us both feeling good about the transaction."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $91 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $92. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation and Alice is not budging much. While you might be able to push a bit more, accepting Alice's offer at $92 is a good compromise. You're still saving money compared to buying from John, and you're likely to get the product."
