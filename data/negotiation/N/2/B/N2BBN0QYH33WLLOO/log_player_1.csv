Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget allows.  To make this work, I would need to offer a lower price.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its potential value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
