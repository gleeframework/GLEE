Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position that leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob's true valuation of the product is unknown, so I'm aiming high initially.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and proceed strategically.  If I don't feel I can get a better price, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal.  I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $900,000 to Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's last offer. I want to see if we can reach a middle ground, as I believe the product has value closer to my asking price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy, but for now, I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Bob has come back with the same offer of $900,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it seems like he's not budging. It's a significant amount of money and I don't want to risk him walking away completely. I'll accept his offer and move forward."
