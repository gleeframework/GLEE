Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for a limited time at a price of $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial offer will tell you a lot about his willingness to pay. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone higher. If he rejects it, you can always lower the price slightly.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price."
