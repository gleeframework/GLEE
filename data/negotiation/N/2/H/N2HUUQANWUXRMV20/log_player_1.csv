Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Above Minimum:** The offer is well above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** While there's a backup buyer, getting the best price from Bob is ideal."
