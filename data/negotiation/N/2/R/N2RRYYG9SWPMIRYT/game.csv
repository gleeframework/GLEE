"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay.  I'm ready to buy for $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. How about $9,000? I'm really serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
