"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I want to keep the conversation friendly and open to a deal. 
* **Value proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I hope to get Bob to counter at a price closer to my desired outcome. This will allow for a smooth negotiation where we can both potentially find a price that works.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly in the following rounds. If he doesn't counter, I'll have several more rounds to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8800 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that benefits both of us.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and show him I'm serious about getting a good price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price. I will try to find a compromise that is fair to both of us.  However, if the negotiation doesn't progress, I will be prepared to sell to John in later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $9,200? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still maintaining a price significantly above Bob's initial offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Openness:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I hope to signal my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. This will hopefully encourage Bob to counter with a price closer to my target. If not, I'll continue adjusting my offer in subsequent rounds while keeping John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8900 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my target:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Time is on my side:**  We're only in round 4, and I still have several rounds left to negotiate.
* **Maintaining pressure:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can keep the pressure on him to increase his bid.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price. I will continue to assess the situation and consider selling to John if the negotiation stalls further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I value your business, $8,900 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $9,100? I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll get out of the product."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight compromise:** I'm lowering my price again, showing flexibility, but still keeping it higher than Bob's offer.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Finding middle ground:** I'm suggesting a compromise to show I'm open to a fair deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing to inch closer to Bob's desired price, but at a pace that keeps me above my minimum acceptable price. My goal is to see if I can entice Bob to raise his offer just a little more. If this doesn't work, I'll be ready to make another counteroffer or even consider John's offer in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8700 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is going down, not up:**  Bob's offer is actually lower than his previous one, indicating he's not willing to budge significantly. 
* **Time is running out:** We're in Round 6, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I need to make progress soon.
* **John's offer is tempting:** I'm getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes more attractive.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer in the next round to try and get Bob closer to my target price. If he rejects, I will seriously consider John's offer. I want to get the best possible price but don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a deal that works for you.  However, I'm finding it difficult to go lower than $9,000. This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it allows me to stay within my acceptable range. I'm hopeful you can see the value in accepting this offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm holding firm at a price that's still above Bob's offer but represents a significant concession from my starting point.
* **Highlighting the discount:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential savings he's getting.
* **Encouraging acceptance:**  I'm expressing hope that Bob will recognize the value and accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

This is likely my last counteroffer before I consider John's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make one last push to reach an agreement. If he rejects, I'll likely move forward with John's offer to ensure I secure a sale within my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting worse:** Bob's offer has actually gone *down* again, showing a lack of willingness to compromise. 
* **Time is running out:** We're in Round 8, with only two rounds left. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired price, and I'm no longer confident I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob outweighs the potential reward.  John's offer gives me a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements. I'm choosing to secure the deal and move on."
