"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's a high price, but still leaves room for negotiation. We want to see if Bob will accept the offer without much pushback. If he rejects, we'll adjust our strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below our minimum threshold of $1,000,000. We've already established that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation. We can likely secure a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a great deal, while allowing me to meet my own financial goals. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, it's still below our desired threshold. We have 6 rounds left, and we're not desperate to sell.  Rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer allows us to continue pushing for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm still committed to working with you, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is approaching our minimum acceptable price, we still have 4 rounds left and can likely secure a higher price.  We need to be mindful of the time, but we're not in a desperate position yet.  Rejecting his offer allows us to try and negotiate a price closer to our desired $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However,  $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,175,000? This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

We're now in the middle stages of negotiation. We've lowered our price significantly from our initial offer, but we still need to ensure we get a price that's above our minimum threshold.  We're also attempting to emphasize the value Bob will receive, hoping to entice him to accept a higher price. This offer is a reasonable compromise while still allowing for potential future negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is now below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While we could try to counteroffer again, the chances of success are diminishing. 

Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures we meet our minimum goal and secure a sale.  It's a safer option than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
