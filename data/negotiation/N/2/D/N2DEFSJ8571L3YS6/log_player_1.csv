"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,200 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,200 is just a little too low for me. How about $8,700? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 8700}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $8300. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,300 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's important to remember that I still make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
