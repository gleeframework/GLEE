"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, the offer of $1,400,000 falls short of what I believe is fair compensation. To move things forward, I'd be willing to accept $1,800,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
