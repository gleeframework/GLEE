"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it,  which is still a good deal for both of us. ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $10,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still out of my price range. I'm ready to make a final offer of $12,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a good profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $12,000 is still not meeting my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",18000.0,Alice,5,
