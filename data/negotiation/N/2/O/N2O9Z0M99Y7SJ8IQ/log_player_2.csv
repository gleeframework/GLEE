# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but it's not acceptable yet."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,500,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $1,200,000.  You can try to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price, as it's still cheaper than buying from John."
