{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I'm confident I can get my full asking price elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's an opportunity to make even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  A price of $1,250,000 is significantly attractive to Bob (saving him $250,000) while still netting you a substantial profit above your minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The message creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly before he loses the opportunity."
