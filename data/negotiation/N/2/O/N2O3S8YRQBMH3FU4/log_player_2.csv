"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I'm confident I can get my full asking price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get a better deal from John at $1,000,000.  You stand to save a significant amount by rejecting Alice's offer."
