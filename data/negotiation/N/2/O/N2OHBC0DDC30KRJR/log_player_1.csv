Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $180 is very close to my initial goal and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a much better outcome, and the risk of Bob walking away is high. Accepting this offer ensures a sale with a decent profit."
