Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I can meet you halfway between $75 and my previous offer, so I'll do $105.

While Alice is getting closer to my price range, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $105.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John for $80."
