"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value. ",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,750.  This is a final offer from my end.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
