"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6,000 at this time.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers you a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground. However, $10,000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $7,000. Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  While I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, $7,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind. To be frank, I have another offer for $10,000.  If you're able to meet that, the product is yours.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about buying this product at the right price. I can go up to $7,500.  This is my final offer, so please consider it carefully.",7500.0,Bob,6,
