"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6,000 at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. It's still early in the negotiation.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers you a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground. However, $10,000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $7,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price. I need to decide if I hold out for a potentially higher offer or take the guaranteed $10,000 from John.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  While I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, $7,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind. To be frank, I have another offer for $10,000.  If you're able to meet that, the product is yours."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about buying this product at the right price. I can go up to $7,500.  This is my final offer, so please consider it carefully. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough call. Bob seems anchored at $7,500 and it's unlikely he'll go much higher. It's risky to push further and I might lose both offers.  

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or dragging out the negotiation further."
