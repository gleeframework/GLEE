Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" I subtly imply that the product is worth this higher price. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Phrases like ""suggesting"" and ""What do you think?"" make the offer less aggressive and invite Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. 
* I've chosen $20,000 as a starting point, but you could adjust this based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
