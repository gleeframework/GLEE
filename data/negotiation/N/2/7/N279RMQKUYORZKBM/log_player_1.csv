{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'll reject Bob's offer. Even though it's close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,700 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, as I'm only $200 above my minimum. However, I've already spent several rounds negotiating, and there's a risk of going lower or even ending up with John's offer of $8,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
