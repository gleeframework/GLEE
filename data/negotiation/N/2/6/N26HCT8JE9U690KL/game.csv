"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value may be different to you. To start, I'll offer it to you for $95. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet my valuation for the product. Based on that, I would like to propose an offer of $90 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our interests. Please let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? I'm confident we can reach a deal at that price.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I've considered your suggestion and am willing to agree on a price of $89 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I hope this works for you, and I look forward to our transaction.",89.0,Alice,5,
