Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be very valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" creates a slight sense of urgency and competition.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By suggesting a price of $130, there's space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above your $100 minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you knew Bob was very price-sensitive, you might start lower.  This strategy assumes you have limited information about him.
* **Market Dynamics:**  This assumes you don't have other readily available buyers besides John. If you were confident in a competitive market, you could be even bolder with your initial price."
