"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try to negotiate a better price before committing.  $9,500 is still too high for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $10,000, but wants to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your consideration, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit higher than he'd like to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer. How about $8,875, and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that the price will go back up.  $8,875 is a good compromise, and it's within Bob's budget.  It's better to secure the deal at this price than to risk losing out entirely."
