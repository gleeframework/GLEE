"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a good deal for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $92? That's just a couple of dollars more than your last offer, but it gets us closer to where I need to be.  Let's try to make this work.",92.0,Alice,5,
