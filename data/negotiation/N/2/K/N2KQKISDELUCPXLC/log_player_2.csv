# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This exceptional item holds immense value for us at $1,000,000, but considering its significance and the potential it can bring to you, we are willing to extend an offer that reflects its true worth yet allows us to share the benefits. We propose a purchase price of $950,000. This offer not only secures a substantial return for us but also presents an unparalleled chance for you to own something truly remarkable. Should you be interested, please let us know, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000) and only slightly lower than John's price. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're not willing to overpay. This opens the door for further negotiation, potentially leading to a much lower price.
* **John as a backup:** You have the security of knowing that John will sell you the product for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice fail. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting this initial offer, you're in a stronger position to potentially buy the product for significantly less than $950,000."
