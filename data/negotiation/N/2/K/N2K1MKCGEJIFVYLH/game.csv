"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $17000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $15000. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
