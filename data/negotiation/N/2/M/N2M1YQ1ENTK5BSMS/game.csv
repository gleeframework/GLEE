"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $5,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $8,500?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
