"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and positive to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not asking for my full value yet, acknowledging that there's room to come down to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value.
* **Not giving up yet:**  Selling to John is an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $5,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, signaling that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize the value of my offer.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm moving closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $7,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for a final counteroffer:** I have several rounds left, and I can still try to push for a higher price.
* **Not ready to sell to John yet:**  While $15,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $8,500?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to his offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Compromise language:** I'm using language like ""compromise"" and ""fair"" to emphasize that I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my proposed price."
