"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $16500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but $16500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $15750?",15750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point of no return. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table.

"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm making a final offer of $15800. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000",15800.0,Bob,10,
