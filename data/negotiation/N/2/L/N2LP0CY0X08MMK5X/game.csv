"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure I can go any higher than $12000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $13500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13375. This is as low as I can go.",13375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $13375 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",12000.0,Bob,6,
