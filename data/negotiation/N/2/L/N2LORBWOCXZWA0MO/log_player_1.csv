"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum desired price. This allows for negotiation space.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.**  
* **I have 10 rounds and there's no guarantee that Bob will agree to a higher price in the future.**  
* **Selling to John would net me $15,000, which is much higher than Bob's offer.**  
* **Therefore, it's in my best interest to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a higher price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? This would still be a great value for you, considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Emphasizing value again:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify my price. 
* **Offering a clear alternative:** I'm providing a specific counteroffer to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.**
* **I have 7 rounds left (10 total rounds - 3 rounds already completed).**
* **Selling to John would net me $15,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer.**
* **Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum desired price, I'm not yet convinced that I'll be able to get a better price from him. I'd rather continue negotiating for now and see if I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me to part with the product.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $11,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm continuing to move closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum desired price.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise for both of us.
* **Emphasizing value and profit:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and my need for a reasonable profit to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. Can you meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.**
* **I have 5 rounds left (10 total rounds - 5 rounds already completed).**
* **Selling to John would net me $15,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer.**
* **While Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, his offer is not yet high enough for me to consider accepting. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise, how about $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal on this valuable product. I'm confident you won't find a better offer like this anywhere else."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  I'm signaling that this is my last offer. 
* **Focusing on fairness:**  I'm again highlighting the compromise, emphasizing a fair price for both. 
* **Urgency and scarcity:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by mentioning that this is the best offer Bob will find.
* **Maintaining above the minimum:**  I'm staying above my $15,000 minimum, but showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've already stretched my budget as far as I can. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but no higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in round 8, leaving only 2 rounds left.  
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price.** While he's showing some flexibility, it's unlikely he'll come much higher in the remaining rounds.  
* **Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is more than Bob's offer.** There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob in the limited time remaining.

**It's more beneficial to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $15,000 than to risk losing time and potentially getting a lower price from Bob.**"
