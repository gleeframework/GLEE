"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to decrease the price if necessary.  

I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but also acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay that much.  By starting high, I can gauge his interest and potentially get closer to my desired price point over the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'm confident that I can get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,500,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation. My hope is that Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise and is willing to come closer to my target price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to get more, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a higher price.  Accepting his offer allows me to secure the sale and avoid the risk of losing a potential buyer."
