"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum threshold.  I hope Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price. Accepting his offer of $165 is the best option at this point. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk he'll walk away or I'll get stuck with a lower price."
