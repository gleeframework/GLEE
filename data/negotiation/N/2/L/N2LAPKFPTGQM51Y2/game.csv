"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more,  how about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
