{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to both of us, so let's see if we can find a price that works for everyone. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to both of us. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 to see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit far off from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This gives us both a good deal, and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go higher than $1,100,000, and I'm unwilling to go lower than $1,125,000.  Considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,200,000, it's time to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
