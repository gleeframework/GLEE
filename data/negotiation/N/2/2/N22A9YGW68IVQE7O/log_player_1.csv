Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120 and also less than the value Bob himself assigns to the product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $85 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? This is still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
