Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us. How does $14,000 sound? "", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low, and I can still potentially get more from him.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $13,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and my previous offer of $12,000. How about $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $12,750 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get closer to my initial offer of $14,000.  I'm going to counter with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's latest offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer! I'm willing to go down to $13,250. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and a price that I believe is still fair considering the value of this product for you.  Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Alice. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is my absolute maximum. I really need this product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer.  It's better to accept his offer now than to keep negotiating and potentially have him walk away."
