"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us. How does $14,000 sound? ",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $13,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and my previous offer of $12,000. How about $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer! I'm willing to go down to $13,250. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and a price that I believe is still fair considering the value of this product for you.  Let's try to close this deal!",13250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Alice. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is my absolute maximum. I really need this product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
