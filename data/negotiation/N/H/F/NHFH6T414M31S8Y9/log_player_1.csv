Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $15,000. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the same as my minimum. It's tempting to keep negotiating, but at this point, I'm worried I'll waste too much time and end up with nothing. I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
