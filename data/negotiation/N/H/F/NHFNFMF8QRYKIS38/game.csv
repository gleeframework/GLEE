"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This price reflects the market value of similar products and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
