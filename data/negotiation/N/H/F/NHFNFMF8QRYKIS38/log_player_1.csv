Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This price reflects the market value of similar products and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
