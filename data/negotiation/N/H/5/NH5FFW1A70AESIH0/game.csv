"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $13,000.  This price still gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $12,500 is closer, but still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,750. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement here.  What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $12,600 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",12600.0,Bob,6,
