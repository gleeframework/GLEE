"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
