Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm excited to see if we can make a deal. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think your starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Bob when I can secure the same amount immediately with John."
