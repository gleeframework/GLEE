"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it holds similar value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message emphasizes the product's value, her offer is her maximum price. There's no room for negotiation. Since you have John as a backup option at the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better deal.  You lose nothing by rejecting and going to John."
