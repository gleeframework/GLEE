"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. This product is only worth $8,000 to me, so I'd be willing to offer $5,000.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling the product for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $6,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $7,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $6,750, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $7,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Alice,7,
