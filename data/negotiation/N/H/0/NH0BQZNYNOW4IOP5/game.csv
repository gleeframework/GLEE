"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still leaves room for you to make a profit and is closer to my minimum acceptable price. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
