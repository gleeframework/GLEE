"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $850,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $900,000?  This still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
