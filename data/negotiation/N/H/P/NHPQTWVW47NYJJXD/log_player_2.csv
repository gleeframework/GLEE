"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $850,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $900,000?  This still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
