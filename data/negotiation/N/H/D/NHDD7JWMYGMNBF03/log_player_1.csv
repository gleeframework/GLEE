{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still lower than my minimum price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm framing the message in a positive way, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message indicates willingness to negotiate, inviting Bob to respond. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale at a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'll be prepared to make further counteroffers or walk away if the price doesn't meet my minimum.  
* John provides a safety net, allowing me to end the negotiation with Bob if necessary and still get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum:**  $5,000 is far below my minimum price of $15,000, and even lower than the value Bob himself places on the product ($8,000).
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable,  rejecting it allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price.

**Next steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise.
* If Bob continues to offer prices too low, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this sale work.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000.  This would still allow you to get a good deal and me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to my minimum:**  The $9,000 price is closer to my minimum price of $15,000 than Bob's $5,000 offer.
* **Appealing to a middle ground:**  The message emphasizes finding a middle ground and frames the $9,000 price as a win-win for both of us.
* **Continuing the dialogue:**  The message invites Bob to continue the conversation and potentially reach an agreement. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale at a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer than before, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  We're making progress, and by rejecting this offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While I can sell to John for $15,000, I'm not willing to give up just yet.  I believe there's still room for a deal with Bob that would be more profitable.

**Next steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum, perhaps somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000. 
* I'll frame my counter-offer in a way that emphasizes the value of the product for Bob and highlights the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* If Bob continues to offer prices too low, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant concession on my part.

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to my minimum:**  $10,000 is significantly closer to my minimum price of $15,000 than Bob's $7,000 offer.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  The message emphasizes that I'm willing to make concessions to reach a deal.
* **Highlight the value proposition:**  I remind Bob that he would still get a good deal at $10,000, emphasizing the value of the product.
