"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I'm confident it will more than prove its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be open to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
