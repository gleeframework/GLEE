{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This will give me some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  How about $140? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm offering a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I would like to counter with an offer of $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Bob won't budge much more, and I'm already running the risk of losing time.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and saves me the effort of further negotiation."
