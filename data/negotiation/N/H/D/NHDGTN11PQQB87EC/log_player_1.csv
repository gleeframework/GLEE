Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that to you, so I think this is a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $2,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, but you have some wiggle room to come down a bit.
* **It's appealing to Bob:**  $14,000 is still a good deal for Bob considering its worth to him.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me, would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I need to make more than that to make it worth my while.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $14,000 to $12,500, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** This offer is still above my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Appealing to Bob:**  $12,500 is still a good deal for Bob as it's lower than his initial valuation of $15,000.

Let's see if Bob will accept this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $12,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  I'm not willing to go any lower. It's better to sell to John for $12,000, which is my minimum price and ensures I don't lose money. This also saves time and energy on further negotiation."
