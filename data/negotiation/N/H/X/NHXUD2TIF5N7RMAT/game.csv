"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm happy to purchase the product for $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this reflects the product's value fairly.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $1,100,000 is closer but I'm still a bit too high.  Let's try $1,075,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
