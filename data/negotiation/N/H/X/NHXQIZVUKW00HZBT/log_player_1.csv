"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking for a price closer to $80. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I want to see if I can get closer to that value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $95 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $135? This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $110. This still allows me to save some money while getting the product I need. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $110 is still too low for me.  How about we meet at $125? That's a reasonable compromise, and it will allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. Would $115 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $120 for this to be worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $117. This still allows me to save some money while getting the product I need. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

It's getting a bit frustrating with Bob. We're still too far apart in price and there are only a couple of rounds left.  To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  This guarantees a good outcome for me."
