# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Alice's offer is far too high. It's best to reject and start a counteroffer process."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,000,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects a significant reduction on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.

Alice's offer is still too high, but she's showing some willingness to negotiate. It's worth continuing the counteroffer process to see if we can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $1,100,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $1,450,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  Although I would prefer to buy from Alice, $800,000 from John is the best deal for me right now."
