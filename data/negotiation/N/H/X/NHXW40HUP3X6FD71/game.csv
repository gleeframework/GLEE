"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,000,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects a significant reduction on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  This price allows for a decent profit for you, and it's within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $1,100,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $1,450,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
