"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for a product of this value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $750,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you be open to considering $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet at least $775,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",775000.0,Alice,7,
