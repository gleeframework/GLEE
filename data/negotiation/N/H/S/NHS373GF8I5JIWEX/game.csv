"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $120 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we meet somewhere between $135 and $120? Perhaps $130 would be a fair compromise for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
