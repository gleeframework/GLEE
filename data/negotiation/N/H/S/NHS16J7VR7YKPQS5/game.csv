"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",11250.0,Alice,5,
