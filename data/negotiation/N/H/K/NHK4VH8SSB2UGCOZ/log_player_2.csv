"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth discussing. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This price reflects both the value of the product and the opportunity for us to reach an agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to present a compromise. I am willing to consider $13,000 for the product, which is higher than my initial offer but lower than your proposal. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a fair deal for both of us. Please let me know if this is acceptable.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $13,000, he's saving $2,000 compared to buying from John, and it's still a better price than his counteroffer.  There's no guarantee he can get a lower price, and he risks losing the deal entirely if Alice walks away."
