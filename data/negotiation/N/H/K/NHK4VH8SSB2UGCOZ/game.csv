"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further. However, $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to present a compromise. I am willing to consider $13,000 for the product, which is higher than my initial offer but lower than your proposal. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a fair deal for both of us. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",13000.0,Alice,3,
