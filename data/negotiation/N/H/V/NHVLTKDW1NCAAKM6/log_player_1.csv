"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I believe this is a fair starting point that might encourage Bob to accept while also giving me a chance to earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can nudge him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation. Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to work with him while still maintaining a good profit margin."
