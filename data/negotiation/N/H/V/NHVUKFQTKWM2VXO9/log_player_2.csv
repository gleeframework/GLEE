"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a unique opportunity, as the product is worth exactly that amount to you.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being very direct about the product being worth exactly $1,000,000 to you (and to her). This leaves no room for negotiation or a lower price. Since you have the option to buy from John at the same price, it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal from Alice by rejecting this initial offer."
