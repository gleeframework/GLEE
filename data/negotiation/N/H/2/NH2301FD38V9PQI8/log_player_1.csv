I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still leaves me with a profit.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price without risking losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. It's still above my minimum price and hopefully incentivizes Bob to accept, but leaves room for further negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not confident he'll meet it. With John offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, it's too risky to keep negotiating with Bob."
