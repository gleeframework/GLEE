"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is too high for my budget.  Could we work something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I value your interest, $9,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value for you, but $12,500 is still pushing my budget.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute highest I can go. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  Let's try to make this work. How about we settle on $11,250? It's a compromise that recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your limit.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. That said, the gap between our prices is still pretty wide. To be completely transparent, I've got another offer for $8,000.  If you can do $10,500, we have a deal. If not, I need to seriously consider my other option.",10500.0,Bob,6,
