"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is too high for my budget.  Could we work something closer to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** While $9,000 is still a significant jump from Alice's initial offer, it establishes your price range and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone is important for successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I value your interest, $9,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  Alice came down a bit, but $12,500 is still above your maximum budget.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to ""meet in the middle"" suggests she's open to further negotiation.  You can likely get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value for you, but $12,500 is still pushing my budget.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute highest I can go. "",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're making a more assertive counteroffer, signaling the seriousness of your budget limit.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $10,000 leaves a little wiggle room for a final compromise if Alice is truly motivated to sell. 
* **Time Pressure:** As rounds progress, the option to go with John's $8,000 offer becomes more appealing if Alice won't budge significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  Let's try to make this work. How about we settle on $11,250? It's a compromise that recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your limit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice has come down in price, but the concessions are getting smaller. At this pace, you are unlikely to reach a price you are happy with.
* **John's Offer:**  The difference between Alice's current offer and John's guaranteed $8,000 is significant enough to warrant continuing the negotiation a bit longer, but time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me. That said, the gap between our prices is still pretty wide. To be completely transparent, I've got another offer for $8,000.  If you can do $10,500, we have a deal. If not, I need to seriously consider my other option."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadline Pressure:** You're running out of rounds and need to make Alice aware that you have a viable alternative.
* **Slight Concession:**  Moving slightly from $10,000 to $10,500 shows flexibility while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Clear Ultimatum:**  This message makes it clear that this is likely your final offer with Alice, encouraging a decision."
