Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also reflects that the product is worth more to Bob than it is to me. By starting at a high price, I maximize my potential profit. 

I'm confident that Bob will find the offer attractive, considering the product is worth $10,000 to him.  If he rejects, I can then counteroffer or move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point.  I'm confident that Bob wants the product enough to negotiate further.  Selling to John for $8,000 is not a good option as I can potentially earn more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob at $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. It reflects my willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price that is closer to my desired value. 

I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and likely to be accepted by Bob, given his stated value of $10,000.  If he rejects, I can always consider John's offer, but I am still confident that I can secure a higher price from Bob through continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but it's also the price John is willing to pay. Given that we've reached an impasse with Bob and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a higher price, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John. This ensures a quick and certain sale at a price that is acceptable to me."
