"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's a fair price for a product of this quality.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is my final offer, as I know I can get that price elsewhere.",8000.0,Alice,5,
