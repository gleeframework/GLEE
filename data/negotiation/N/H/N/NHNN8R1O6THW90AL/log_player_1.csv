Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to be negotiated.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of the surplus value for yourself, but not so high that Bob will walk away. 

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and appealing to Bob's understanding of its worth.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you with $150,000 above your minimum and leaves $50,000 on the table for Bob. This split incentivizes Bob to accept, as he's still getting a good deal compared to his perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower the price to increase your chances of acceptance.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, you might consider a more even split of the surplus.

**Remember:** This is just one possible offer.  You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of the situation and your negotiation style."
