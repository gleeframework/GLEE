"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you letting me know your budget. I'm happy to work with you, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140 to meet your budget halfway.  This price still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a great deal on the product.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
