Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling yourself short by going below your $10,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob's likely to counteroffer, but you still have room to bargain without feeling pressured.
* **It's a fair initial offer:**  Considering Bob values the product at $12,000, this price gives him some room to negotiate while ensuring you get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum, it's only slightly above. You have a better chance of getting a higher price by continuing the negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $10,500.  How about $10,800? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired price:** Bob's offer of $10,800 is only $200 away from your initial counteroffer of $11,000. This is a small enough difference to consider accepting.
* **Better than John's offer:**  While John is willing to pay $10,000, accepting Bob's offer nets you an extra $800.
* **Limited negotiation room:** If you reject Bob's offer, he might further lower his offer, and you risk ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
