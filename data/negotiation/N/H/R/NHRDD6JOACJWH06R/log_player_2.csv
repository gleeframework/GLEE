"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial price, it's still above your budget. You can do better. By rejecting the offer, you can counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,000, which is still above my budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it leaves some room for compromise. If Alice rejects, I can continue negotiating or choose to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is within my budget and is a good deal considering her initial asking price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer again or even increase her price. Buying from John for $8,000 is a better option in the long run, but accepting this offer guarantees I get the product."
