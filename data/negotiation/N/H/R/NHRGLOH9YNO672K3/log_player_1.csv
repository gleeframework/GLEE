Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $300,000 if you can sell it above John's offer.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while still maximizing your profit.  Here's a balanced approach:

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  Keeps it brief, positive, and emphasizes potential value to Bob.
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's:
    * Significantly below Bob's maximum value, making it more appealing.
    * Still a substantial $150,000 above your minimum, leaving room for potential negotiation.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Information:** This assumes you don't know if Bob has other options. If he does, your negotiating power might be weaker.
