"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within the range Bob might consider. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Building rapport:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to entice Bob to engage. 
* **Room for compromise:** I'm not asking for my full valuation immediately, giving Bob the opportunity to counteroffer without feeling like he's being completely unreasonable.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware this is a game. In a real negotiation, I'd need to consider more factors like Bob's financial situation, the urgency of the sale, and the market value of the product. This is just a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum valuation of $1,000,000 and even below Bob's perceived value of $800,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is willing to negotiate, indicating he values the product.  There's still potential for a deal closer to my desired price.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 8 more rounds to reach a better agreement.  Selling to John immediately would be a safe option, but I believe I can secure a better price through negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my valuation, keeping in mind that I want to reach an agreement before time runs out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial asking price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price and encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Room for further negotiation:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it still leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a raw deal.

**Important Note:** This round is critical. I need to find a balance between being firm on my desired price and remaining open to negotiation. The goal is to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind. I could meet you halfway between our previous offers.  Would $750,000 be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $750,000 is still lower than my minimum valuation of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant financial loss.
* **Time is running out:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation. While selling to John is always an option, I still believe I can secure a better price with Bob.
* **Opportunity for compromise:** Bob's offer shows a willingness to negotiate further. It's possible to reach an agreement closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his last offer, but still below my minimum valuation. I need to find a compromise that is acceptable to both parties and secure a deal before time runs out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've invested in this negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer but still lower than my minimum valuation. This shows a willingness to compromise and potentially secure a deal.
* **Time pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, I'm emphasizing the time we've invested in the negotiation to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Fair offer:**  I'm presenting $850,000 as a ""fair"" price, considering the product's value and Bob's budget. 

**Important Note:** I'm nearing my minimum valuation, so this is a crucial round. I need to be firm but also flexible to reach a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $850,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we settle at $825,000? That's a firm offer from my side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $825,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum valuation of $1,000,000. 
* **Time pressure:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation with only 4 rounds left. There's a risk of losing the deal entirely if I keep rejecting Bob's offers.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though I'm taking a slight loss this time, accepting Bob's offer might build a good relationship for potential future deals where I can secure a better price.

**Conclusion:**

Given the circumstances, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the best option. It ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing out to John or failing to reach an agreement with Bob. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a good outcome considering the time constraints and the potential for future interactions."
