"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial asking price.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind. I could meet you halfway between our previous offers.  Would $750,000 be acceptable?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've invested in this negotiation. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $850,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we settle at $825,000? That's a firm offer from my side.",825000.0,Bob,6,
