It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Since you have a backup option with John, there's no risk in trying to get a lower price from Alice."

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than the $800,000 you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target price."

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now within your acceptable range. Accepting her offer is the best course of action. You'll save $125,000 compared to buying from John and get the product for a price you're comfortable with."
