"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is closer to my ideal price.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,025,000.  Would that be feasible for you?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $1,050,000? This would be a good middle ground for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
