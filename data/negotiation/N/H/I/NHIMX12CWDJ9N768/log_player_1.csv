Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since the product is worth $10,000 to both you and Bob, there's room for negotiation. Starting with a significantly higher offer ($14,000) allows for potential negotiation downwards while still aiming for a profit above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, and a high initial offer gives you space to decrease the price while still securing a good deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
