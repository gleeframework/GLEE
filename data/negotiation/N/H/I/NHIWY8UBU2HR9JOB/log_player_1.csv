{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to build a positive rapport with Bob by highlighting the value of the product and presenting the offer as a good deal.
* **Open ended question:**  Asking an open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings by:

* **Setting a high anchor:**  The initial high price influences Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The higher starting price allows for room to negotiate downwards while still potentially getting a good price.
* **Testing the waters:** Seeing Bob's reaction to the offer will help me understand his interest level and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a slightly better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially securing a sale closer to my initial goal of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference at $9,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's still a great deal for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive framing:** I'm phrasing it as a ""fair compromise"" and a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob.

By taking this approach, I hope to:

* **Increase the likelihood of acceptance:**  The compromise makes the offer more attractive while still giving me a good price.
* **Show flexibility:**  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to continue the conversation.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Keeping the communication positive can help build rapport and increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $9250 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9000.  I'm sure we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is now very close to my desired price range.  Considering the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price, and the fact that selling to John would result in a lower profit, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option at this point. It's a good deal, and I'm confident I can still make a good profit."
