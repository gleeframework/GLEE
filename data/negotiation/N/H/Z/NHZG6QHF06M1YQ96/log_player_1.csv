"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a better deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By presenting a high initial price, we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he rejects this offer, his counteroffer might be closer to our desired range.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we always want the best price, having John as a guaranteed backup at $1,500,000 provides a safety net. We can afford to negotiate firmly with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000), signaling room for negotiation. While we could accept and secure a profit, we're aiming to maximize our earnings.  We have the security of John's offer, so it's worth countering in hopes of closing a deal closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product goes beyond a simple assessment. It offers unique potential for growth and innovation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about we settle for $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  By suggesting we meet halfway between our previous offer and his, we're appealing to a sense of fairness while still staying significantly above both his perceived value and our guaranteed offer from John.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the product's broader potential beyond Bob's immediate assessment, subtly justifying the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now matched John's offer of $1,500,000 and stated it's his final offer.  

* **Matching Offers:**  We've reached the point where continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob and being forced to settle for John's offer anyway. 
* **Finality:** Bob's ""final offer"" statement indicates strong resistance to going higher.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, securing the sale now avoids potential delays and uncertainty.

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees us the best possible outcome at this stage."
