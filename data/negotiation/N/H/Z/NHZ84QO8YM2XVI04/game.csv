"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product is worth every penny. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
