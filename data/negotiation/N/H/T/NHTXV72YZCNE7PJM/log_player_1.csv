Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in.  My asking price is $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $9,500 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer. 

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,800 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While I can sell to John for $10,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product!  $8,800 is a bit lower than I can go right now.  How about $9,200?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $9,200 is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's low offer but staying closer to my desired price. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to highlight the good deal Bob is getting. 
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly tone, encouraging further negotiation and a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,900. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $8,900 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below the $10,000 I can get from John.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a lengthy process and the possibility of him rejecting further offers.
* **Guarantee Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids potential risks associated with further negotiations. 

In this situation, the certainty of a $10,000 sale outweighs the potential for a slightly better price from Bob."
