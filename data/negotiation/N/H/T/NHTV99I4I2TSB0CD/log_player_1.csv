Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $1,400,000, you are aiming to capture a significant portion of the value Bob sees in it while still ensuring a substantial profit for yourself.  

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (and you having to settle for $1,000,000 from John) with the potential reward of a much higher sale price."
