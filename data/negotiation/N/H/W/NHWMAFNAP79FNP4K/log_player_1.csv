Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a great price considering its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for a price too close to $1,200,000 (like $1,199,000) leaves little incentive for Bob to choose your offer over waiting for a potential better deal in the future. 
* **Reasonable Margin:** The offered price of $1,150,000 provides a significant profit margin for you while still being potentially attractive to Bob, as it saves him $50,000 compared to its perceived value.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a deal with Bob."
