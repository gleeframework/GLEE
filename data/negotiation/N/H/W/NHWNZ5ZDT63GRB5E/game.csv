"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell it for. I can compromise at $11,000. I think that's a fair price for the product's value and quality. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
