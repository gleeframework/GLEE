"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still below its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and also saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer is the best way to maximize your savings."
