"Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal. While your offer is appreciated, the  $2,300,000 price reflects the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so to move us forward, I'll counter at $2,100,000.  This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
