"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
