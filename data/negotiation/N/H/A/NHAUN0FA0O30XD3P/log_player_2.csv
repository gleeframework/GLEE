"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $9,000 to Alice, saving $1,000 compared to John's price.
* **Alice is still getting a profit.** She's selling for $9,000, and the product is worth $8,000 to her, meaning she makes a profit of $1,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for you."
