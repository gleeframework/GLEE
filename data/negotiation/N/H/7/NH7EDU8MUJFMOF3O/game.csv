"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  It represents a significant investment on my end, and that price wouldn't make me whole. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be frank, $1,000,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, but that's my firm offer.  It reflects the true value and potential of this product. Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that this product is valuable to you, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, $1,200,000 is a significant move, and I appreciate you working with me.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $1,550,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm ready to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it's my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
