Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  It represents a significant investment on my end, and that price wouldn't make me whole. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

We're still significantly below John's offer. It's time to push Bob a bit more to see if he's really willing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be frank, $1,000,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, but that's my firm offer.  It reflects the true value and potential of this product. Let me know what you think."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that this product is valuable to you, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

We are getting closer, but we are still below John's offer, and we need to incentivize Bob to go higher. Let's see if we can get him closer to the $1,500,000 mark."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, $1,200,000 is a significant move, and I appreciate you working with me.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?"",

Round 8
Bob's offer:

This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it's my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough decision! Bob is getting closer to our acceptable range, but the gap between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is getting smaller. It's time to play it safe.

```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

While we could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, there's a real risk he'll walk away at this point. John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price, and in this case, the certainty is worth more than the potential (but risky) extra profit."
