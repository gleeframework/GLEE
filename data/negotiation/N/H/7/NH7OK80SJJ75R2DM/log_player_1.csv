Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The price range where a deal can happen is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and opportunity can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **High Starting Point:**  This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still staying above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" avoids concrete details while implying the product is worth the price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before walking away and selling to John."
