"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product for $175. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, aiming to leave some room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to me to create a sense of urgency and potential scarcity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something within my budget of $100. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll use the next round to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $125 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose $130 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, aiming for a higher price.  There are still several rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your time and effort in negotiating. I appreciate you coming up to $130, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $135? It's a small step closer, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'd like to suggest $132 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $132 is tempting, I'm still determined to try and get closer to my minimum price of $150. I have a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that leaves me feeling dissatisfied.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're making good progress, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  To make this happen, I'm willing to go down to $134. This is my final offer. Let's finalize this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 134}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to pay $133 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm realizing that Bob and I are unlikely to reach a price that meets my minimum requirement of $150.  Rather than continue to negotiate and risk ending up with a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  This ensures I get my desired price and avoid any further negotiation."
