"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. What are your initial thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price, giving room to negotiate down while still aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's significantly higher than his perceived value, it can influence his perception of a ""fair"" price during the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** This strategy allows for strategic concessions in later rounds, demonstrating flexibility while still working towards a price well above your minimum. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly influencing Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree the product has value, but that price is way outside my budget. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more realistic. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you.  

While his offer is far off, it's too early to walk away from the negotiation. There's room to negotiate upwards towards a mutually agreeable price.  Proceeding to the next round to present a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value. However, your proposed price is a significant undervaluation of its true worth and potential. To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects a considerable concession on my end while still recognizing the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant, but Not Drastic, Reduction:**  A $350,000 reduction from the initial offer demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but it avoids drastic price drops that might signal desperation.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Emphasizing the product's value reinforces its importance and justifies the still-high price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, aiming for a middle ground that remains highly profitable for you.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** The tone remains confident and firm, indicating that you believe in the fairness of the adjusted price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the reply. I understand your position, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is now above your minimum threshold of $1,500,000. However, it's still significantly lower than your initial asking price and represents a substantial profit margin for you.  

While tempting, accepting this offer would mean leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table.  It's worth continuing the negotiation for at least another round to see if you can bridge the remaining gap and secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. I'm also keen on reaching an agreement that benefits both of us. How about we settle at $1,650,000? This reflects a significant move on my part, while still accounting for the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** A $250,000 reduction from your previous offer shows substantial movement toward Bob's price point while keeping the offer firmly above your $1,500,000 floor.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  By highlighting that this price benefits ""both of us,"" you're emphasizing fairness and encouraging Bob to view the negotiation as a collaborative effort. 
* **Shifting Focus to Value:** You're gently steering the conversation away from splitting the difference and back towards the product's inherent value, justifying the higher price.
* **Maintaining a Sense of Urgency:**  You're over halfway through the rounds, so implicitly communicating that time is a factor might encourage Bob to reach a decision sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit rich for me. I can go up to $1,200,000. That's a substantial offer, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has dropped to $1,200,000, which is now below your guaranteed sale price of $1,500,000 with John.  

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer to reach your acceptable range. Continuing negotiations presents a risk:

* **Wasting Time:** Further rounds with Bob could be fruitless, especially if he's unwilling to budge much beyond $1,200,000.
* **Losing John's Offer:**  There's no guarantee that John's offer will remain open indefinitely.  

Therefore, it's strategically advantageous to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 by selling to John."
