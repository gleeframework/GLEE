"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. What are your initial thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree the product has value, but that price is way outside my budget. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more realistic. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value. However, your proposed price is a significant undervaluation of its true worth and potential. To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects a considerable concession on my end while still recognizing the value this product brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the reply. I understand your position, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. I'm also keen on reaching an agreement that benefits both of us. How about we settle at $1,650,000? This reflects a significant move on my part, while still accounting for the true value of the product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit rich for me. I can go up to $1,200,000. That's a substantial offer, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
