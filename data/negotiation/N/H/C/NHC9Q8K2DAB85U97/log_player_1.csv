"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I have John as a backup. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $120 is significantly less than my minimum. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'd be happy to accept $150 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering Bob my minimum price.  This is still a good deal for me, and I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of him continuing to negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $130 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140 for this product.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering $140 as a compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will find this offer more appealing and agree to buy the product.  If not, I'm still willing to negotiate further in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $135 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $135, which is only $5 below my minimum.  It's getting close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less than I would like.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
