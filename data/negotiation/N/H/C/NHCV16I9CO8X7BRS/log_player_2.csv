"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but $110 is still too close to that limit. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  There's room to bargain, as the product is only worth $80 to Alice. 
* **You have time.** You have 10 rounds to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within your range:** $95 is still within your budget and allows room for further negotiation.
* **Reasonable starting point:** It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and conveys your interest in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit high, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $105 is still closer to your upper limit than you'd prefer.
* **More room for negotiation.** You've already shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility. 
* **Time is on your side.**  You have 7 rounds remaining, so there's no need to rush into a deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $100?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to the middle:**  $100 is a compromise that's closer to Alice's last offer, showing you're taking her position seriously.
* **Positive and persuasive:**  The message reinforces your interest and suggests a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $100 is closer to your ideal, it still allows for a small margin for Alice to potentially come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $102.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your budget:** $102.50 is only $2.50 over your preferred price of $100, and it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited negotiating room:**  Alice has stated she's unwilling to go lower, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time pressure:**  You've already gone through several rounds and have limited time remaining.  It's better to secure the deal at a slightly higher price than risk losing the product altogether."
