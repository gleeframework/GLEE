"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $15,000. It's not a good deal, so Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay up to $12,000 himself.  Starting with a counteroffer of $11,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's seriousness in negotiating, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, but $14,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. There's no reason to buy from John yet, as Bob has more rounds to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum price of $12,000 as possible. He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round to show he's willing to compromise, but staying well below Alice's offer.  This should keep the negotiation moving while still giving Bob room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still more than he wants to pay. Bob has 5 rounds left and there is still room for further negotiation.  There's no reason to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price.  He's increasing his offer to $12,500, showing he's serious about buying the product.  This is a significant jump from his last offer, but it's still lower than Alice's most recent offer, keeping the negotiation moving. With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to start making bigger moves."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better deal than Alice's previous offers, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Bob has 3 rounds left to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no reason to buy from John yet, as Bob has a chance to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his maximum price, and he's running out of rounds.  He's increasing his offer again, to $12,250, showing that he's serious about buying the product.  This is a significant move that demonstrates his willingness to compromise. However, with only two rounds remaining, if Alice rejects this offer, Bob might need to consider buying from John to avoid going over his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. This is the last round before Bob has to buy from John. There is still room for negotiation, and Bob has a chance to get a better deal with Alice. It's worth taking the risk of rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Bob needs to make a decision. Alice has come down to $12,750, but that's still too much for Bob.  He's willing to pay his maximum of $12,000 for the product.  If Alice rejects this offer, he'll have no choice but to buy from John. It's a gamble, but it's the best chance Bob has to get the product at his target price."
