"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to you, I propose an initial price of $1200000. This is a special offer considering the high demand and unique features of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's within your budget, there's room for negotiation. You can likely secure a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still leaving room for you to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you and our ongoing negotiation, I propose a price of $1050000. This allows for a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This offer represents a fair middle ground and allows us both to make a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower the price to $1025000. This still maintains a good profit margin for me while offering you a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price point, it's still higher than you want to pay. You have a few rounds left, so rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer might get you closer to your desired price of $975,000.  You can also use the threat of buying from John to encourage Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to come down,  $1,025,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $987500. I believe this offers a fair compromise between maintaining a good profit margin for me and providing you with a competitive price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $987,500 is very close to your desired price point of $975,000, and you only have three rounds left. It's unlikely you'll be able to get a better deal with further negotiation. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer and within your acceptable range."
