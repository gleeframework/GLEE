Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  Since you can get the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses in the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
