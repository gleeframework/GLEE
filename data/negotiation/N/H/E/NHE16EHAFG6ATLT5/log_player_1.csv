Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and this offer reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will provide valuable information about his level of interest and potential price flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer at $8,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a deal below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $10,000. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is below both your minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and his own stated value for the product ($8,000).  This suggests there is room for negotiation. You'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  I'm confident this product offers significant value at $9,000. It's a fair offer considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a concession from our initial offer ($10,000) but staying above our minimum ($8,000) and closer to Bob's stated value.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason for the counteroffer helps maintain a collaborative tone in the negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help us gauge Bob's flexibility and willingness to meet closer to our target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I still think the product is worth less than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob would be willing to go higher. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down, leading you to sell to John at your minimum."
