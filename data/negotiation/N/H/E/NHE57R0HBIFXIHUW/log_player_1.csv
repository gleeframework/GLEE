Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start the negotiation significantly higher.  This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your fallback option.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the potential value to Bob ($1,500,000) aims to justify the high asking price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message keeps the conversation open.  It doesn't demand the full $1,900,000 outright, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he might not be willing to pay that much. His perception of its value, budget constraints, and negotiation skills will influence his response.
* **Relationship:** A more aggressive starting price might strain your relationship with Bob. If maintaining a good relationship is important, you might consider a slightly lower starting point."
