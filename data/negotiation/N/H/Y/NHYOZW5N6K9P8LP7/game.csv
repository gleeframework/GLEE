"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership,  $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,500.  This reflects the value I place on the product and your interest in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
