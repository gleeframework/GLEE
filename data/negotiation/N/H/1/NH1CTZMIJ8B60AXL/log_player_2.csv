"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price. Alice might come back with a counteroffer closer to her product's value of $10,000.  You can always buy from John for $12,000 as your backup plan."
