"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,000? It's the best I can do, and I'm willing to compromise to make this deal work.",13000.0,Bob,4,
