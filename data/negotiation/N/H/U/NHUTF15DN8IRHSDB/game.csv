"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $800,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product while allowing for a fair profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's true value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $750,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Alice,3,
