Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting high ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation while staying closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Gauging interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest and encourage a counteroffer. 
* **Alternative option:** Alice always has the safety net of John's $800,000 offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both his perceived value and Alice's minimum acceptable price.  While it's clear there's a gap to bridge, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for Alice. By rejecting and countering, she can try to negotiate a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below the value this product offers.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $875,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference (almost):**  This counteroffer meets Bob a little closer to the middle of the current price gap, but still leans towards Alice's desired outcome. 
* **Justifying the price:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While closer to her minimum, Alice's counteroffer keeps the negotiation open, allowing Bob to potentially counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $825,000. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is now above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and represents a significant profit. While she could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better result. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit for Alice."
