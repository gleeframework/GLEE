"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you.  My initial price is $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business, $9,500 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down slightly, however.  How about $10,250? This would still allow me to reach my minimum price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9,750 is definitely closer to what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, my minimum price.  Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
