Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has immense potential for you, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its worth and the potential returns it could generate.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial offer:**  Starting at $1,300,000 gives me a good margin ($300,000) while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob and frames the price as fair. 
* **John's offer:** Keeping John's offer in mind ($1,000,000) ensures I won't settle for less than that if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a purchase price of $1100000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $1,100,000 is still significantly below the product's value to Bob and my desired margin.
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:** I can still potentially get a better price by counter-offering. There's room for negotiation, and Bob has already shown interest.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** I'll only consider selling to John if I can't reach a more profitable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This allows for a mutually beneficial deal while still recognizing the product's unique advantages. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  My counter-offer of $1,200,000 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes understanding Bob's constraints while highlighting the value of the product to him.
* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This counter-offer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, potentially making Bob more likely to accept.
* **Staying above John's offer:**  $1,200,000 is still higher than John's offer, making this a more favorable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my financial situation, I am comfortable moving forward with an offer of $1150000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** It's unlikely Bob will go higher, and another round of negotiation might lead to a deadlock. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000 if this deal falls through.

At this point, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and ensures I don't lose out on potential profits. While I would prefer a higher price, the risk of a prolonged negotiation or a lower offer from John makes accepting Bob's current offer the most sensible choice."
