"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $9000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $10500, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $11250. This is the best price I'm willing to offer, considering the product's value and rarity.",11250.0,Alice,5,
