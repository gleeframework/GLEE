Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, I can't go as low as $1,400,000. Let's compromise at $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let me know your thoughts.

It's not worth continuing the negotiation. Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,500,000 and you have the guaranteed option with John."
