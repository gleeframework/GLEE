Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $125, which is a bit below the midpoint of $100 (my minimum) and $150 (Bob's value). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Reasoning:** I've included a friendly message that highlights the product's value to Bob,  making him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind, knowing that I can always sell to him for $100 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $117.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not ideal:** While Bob's offer of $117.5 is above my minimum of $100, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and the product's value to him.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's room for further negotiation.  
* **John as a backup:** I'm not desperate to sell and have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $117.50 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $121.25? This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 121.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer outright, but I'm also not going back to my initial $125. I've offered a counteroffer that's closer to his offer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making him more likely to want to close the deal.
* **Positive language:**  I'm using positive and friendly language to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $121.25 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we meet at $115? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited room for improvement:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to get me much closer to my initial target. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $100.

**Conclusion:**  It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale that's just above my minimum, rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
