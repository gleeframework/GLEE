Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob. The price is still significantly above his perceived value, giving me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning I'll list it publicly, I subtly remind Bob he might lose the opportunity to a competitor if he declines. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
