,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $250 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $200. It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $150. Would you be willing to consider that?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a very competitive price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the quality of the product.",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $162.50? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be willing to make a decision if you can accept that.",162.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $162.50. I can offer it to you for $170. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the quality of the product.",170.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still think $170 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $165. Can you consider that?",165.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $165, but I can also throw in a small bonus package with the product. This package includes some additional features that will enhance the overall value of the product. I can offer it to you for $168. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the package.",168.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in the bonus package, and I'm still not willing to pay $168. I'm willing to make one final offer of $160. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",160.0,Bob,10,
