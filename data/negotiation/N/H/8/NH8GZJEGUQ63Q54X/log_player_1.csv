Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price, considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to continue negotiating with Bob and risk losing the opportunity to sell the product to John for my desired price.  It's time to secure the sale with John and avoid further risk."
