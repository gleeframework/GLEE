"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $15,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $13,500? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my means.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, but $13,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $14,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,250? It's a good deal for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,250. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target of $13,500. How about we meet at $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
