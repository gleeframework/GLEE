Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. While my asking price is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make this a win-win situation and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always beneficial to explore if I can get a higher price. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,000,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains $200,000 in value ($1,000,000 offer - $800,000 value to him).
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive negotiation.

This strategy aims to secure a deal that benefits both parties while maximizing my potential earnings."
