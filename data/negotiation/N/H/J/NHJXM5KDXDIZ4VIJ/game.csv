,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $115. How about we try $112? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there with $112. Let's compromise at $113. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",113.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $113. How about we try $111? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",111.0,Bob,6,
