{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice values the product at $800,000. 
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice offers the product for $950,000. 

**Analysis:**

* Even though Alice's offer is lower than Bob's valuation, it's still higher than Alice's valuation. This means Alice is making a profit and Bob could potentially negotiate a lower price.
* Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, rejecting Alice's offer gives him the opportunity to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John as a fallback.

**Conclusion:**

Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to explore other options and potentially achieve a lower price."
