Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no guarantee of getting a better price from Alice in further rounds, so it's best to accept and avoid potentially missing out on the product."
