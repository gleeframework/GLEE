Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable to you. I'm asking for $120 for it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is significantly higher than your minimum but leaves room for compromise.  It's also important to acknowledge the value for Bob to encourage him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum, it is still below your desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high at $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? "", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, it's a good product.  Could you do $95?  That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $95 is only $5 away from your desired middle ground of $100. It's a good deal, and it's likely that further negotiations will take more time and effort without a significant increase in price."
