"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1090000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1090000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1090000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1025000. This is a fair offer that recognizes the value of the product for me while also allowing you to secure a good profit. I'm confident we can close this deal if we meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
