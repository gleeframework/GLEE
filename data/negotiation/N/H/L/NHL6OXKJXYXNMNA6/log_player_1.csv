Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get at least $100 from John if I need to, so I have some flexibility here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $100. I'm confident I can get a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It's a fair price, and I believe it's likely Bob will accept."
