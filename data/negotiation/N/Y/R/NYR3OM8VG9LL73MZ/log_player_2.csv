"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. I believe it would greatly benefit your operations and enhance your efficiency. Considering its value and the benefits it brings, I am extending this exclusive offer to you for $13,500. This price is inclusive of all features and services, and I am confident it represents an excellent investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $13,500 is unfortunately a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. This is the highest I can go at this time, considering my other options."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of that, I am willing to negotiate further. For your convenience, I am now offering the product at $13,000. This still includes all the features and services you were interested in, and I hope this revised price aligns better with your current budget.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for Alice to come down further. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's meet in the middle at $12,750. This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I've reviewed our conversation and am willing to consider your latest proposal. For the sake of closing the deal, I propose a price of $12,900 for the product. This price still includes all the features and services you're interested in, and I believe it strikes a fair balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,900 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Even though it's close, Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a better price. There's still room for Alice to come down further, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, $12,900 is still a bit too high for me. Given your previous concessions, I believe $12,750 is a fair price, and it's the best I can offer. This would be a good compromise for both of us and will allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering our past negotiations, I am prepared to offer the product at $12,850. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still allowing you to benefit fully from the features and services included. I believe this is a fair price that respects both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,850 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While the negotiation has gotten closer, it's unlikely Alice will budge further. Bob has only three rounds left and should take the sure thing.  Purchasing from John guarantees the lowest price and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
