Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product is truly exceptional and holds substantial value. Let's aim for a price that reflects its worth. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  My counteroffer is $1,600,000. This price is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while remaining realistic.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a unique opportunity that will benefit your business greatly. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and make this a win-win situation.
