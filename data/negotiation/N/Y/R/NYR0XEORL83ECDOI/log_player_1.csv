{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe it will be a significant asset to your business. My initial price is $1,750,000, reflecting its true value and potential. I'm open to discussion, but I'm confident this price is fair given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This reflects a fair price considering market value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product is truly exceptional and holds substantial value. Let's aim for a price that reflects its worth. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  My counteroffer is $1,600,000. This price is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while remaining realistic.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000. I believe this represents a significant step towards a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be strategic."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a unique opportunity that will benefit your business greatly. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and make this a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
