"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a compromise.  I have 8 more rounds to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $100. This is my final offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my preferred $150 mark. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually acceptable price. Selling to John for $150 is always an option, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $100 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115, which is a good compromise. Let's close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
