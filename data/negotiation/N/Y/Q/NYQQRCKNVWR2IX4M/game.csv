"Alice, $12,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your interest in it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm at $9,000. If we can meet at that price, I'm ready to make a deal. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $10,200. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but $10,200 is still a stretch for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go to $9,600.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",9600.0,Bob,6,
