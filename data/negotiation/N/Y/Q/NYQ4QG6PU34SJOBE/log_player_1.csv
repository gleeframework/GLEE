I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to him and I'm willing to sell it for no less than $100. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for both of us."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $120.  While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
