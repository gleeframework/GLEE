"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not convinced that $105 is a fair price for the value of this product. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That's a good compromise for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
