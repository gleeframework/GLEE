"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This represents a significant savings for you and gives me a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is overselling the value of the product to you. You know it's only worth $15,000 to you, and she's trying to create a sense of urgency by claiming it's worth more.  While her offer of $13,500 is less than your maximum, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or confirm that John's offer is the best you'll get."
