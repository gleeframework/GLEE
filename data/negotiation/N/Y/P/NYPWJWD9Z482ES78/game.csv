"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, while also being more competitive than my initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
