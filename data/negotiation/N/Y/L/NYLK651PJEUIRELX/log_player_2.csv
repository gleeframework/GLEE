"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $100. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might lead her to propose a lower price, or you can always fall back on buying from John for $120."
