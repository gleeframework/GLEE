"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation to save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is truly significant. I could come down to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $1,350,000 is a good price, lower than John's and closer to his ideal price.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it risks losing the deal to John."
