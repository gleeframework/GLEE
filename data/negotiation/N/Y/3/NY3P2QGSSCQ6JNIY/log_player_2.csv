"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $135.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is overpriced. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so there's no point in paying $135. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice or resort to buying from John."
