"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and the substantial benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I begin with a strong offer significantly above my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's importance.
* **Justification:**  I provide a brief justification focused on ""value"" and ""benefits"" to anchor Bob's perception around a higher price point. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone is positive and suggestive of a willingness to discuss, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Willingness:** His response will reveal how eager he is to buy and how high he might be willing to go.
2. **Establish a Strong Position:** Starting high gives me more bargaining power as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the unique value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to a potentially acceptable range, it's still significantly below my target. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of settling for a less-than-ideal deal this early in the process.  I believe there's room to work towards a price closer to $1,600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,600,000. This reflects the true significance of what the product brings to the table. Are you open to finding a middle ground in this range?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm (for now):** I'm maintaining a firm stance near my desired price point to test Bob's flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message reinforces the product's value without directly dismissing Bob's offer.
* **Invitation to Negotiate:** I'm explicitly inviting further discussion and a potential compromise.  

By staying slightly above Bob's last offer, I'm aiming to:

1.  **Encourage Movement:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to significantly increase his offer.
2.  **Maintain Momentum:** I'm keeping the negotiation active and pushing towards a potentially more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's significance, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 represents a significant compromise on his part and is a strong deal for me. Here's why:

* **Exceeds My Minimum:** This price is well above my $1,200,000 minimum and provides a healthy profit margin.
* **Strong Negotiation:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating serious interest and a willingness to pay a premium.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and the potential for Bob to lower his offer or walk away. 

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a marginally better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids leaving money on the table."
