Alice's offer:

This is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her limit:**  Alice has clearly stated that $800,000 is the lowest she's willing to go. 
* **Saving money:**  Bob gets the product for $200,000 less than John's price.
* **No guarantee of a better deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Alice might walk away, leaving Bob to purchase from John at the higher price."
