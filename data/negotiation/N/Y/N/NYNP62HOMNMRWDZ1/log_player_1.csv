Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob has a strong incentive to accept. Here's why:

* **For you:** This price allows you to earn significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, while still leaving a potential $50,000 profit for Bob.
* **For Bob:** This price is still a good deal for him as he can buy the product for $50,000 less than it's worth to him. 

This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still ensuring a substantial profit for you."
