"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $9000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $7500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
