This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to leave room for negotiation but also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my original offer.  How about $1,300,000?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $1,250,000 is a fair compromise. It's significantly better than selling to John and allows me to move forward with the sale."
