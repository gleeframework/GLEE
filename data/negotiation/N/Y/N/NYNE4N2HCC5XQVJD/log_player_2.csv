# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than it's worth to you, and I'll still get a fair price. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $10,250?
