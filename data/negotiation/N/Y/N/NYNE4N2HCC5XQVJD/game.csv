"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than it's worth to you, and I'll still get a fair price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much as I can.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $10,250? That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
