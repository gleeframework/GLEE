Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum value, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his potential value might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for below my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and hopefully a more reasonable offer for Bob. I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I value my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Bob's offer is finally above my minimum value, and it's a good compromise. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $10,500."
