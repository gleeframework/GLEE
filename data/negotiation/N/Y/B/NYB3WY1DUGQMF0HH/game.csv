"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? This still gives you a significant savings compared to the product's true value, and it allows me to get a fair price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $10,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.",10750.0,Bob,4,
