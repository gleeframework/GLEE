"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're highlighting in the product. However,  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
