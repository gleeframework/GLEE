Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really trying to get close to your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500, which is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find this product valuable, and I think $8,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal!

At this point, Alice has met your target price. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and it's not worth the risk of her retracting the offer.  You're getting the product at the same price as John is offering."
