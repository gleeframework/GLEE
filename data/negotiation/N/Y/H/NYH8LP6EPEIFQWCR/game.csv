"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low.  This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about $950,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite justify that number.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
