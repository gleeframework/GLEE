"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its high value and unique features, I estimate its worth to be $10000 from your perspective. However, considering the exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $9500. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a discount. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
