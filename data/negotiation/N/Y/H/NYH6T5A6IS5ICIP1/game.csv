"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $850000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
