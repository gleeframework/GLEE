"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what John is charging, you can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to reach a price you're happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering $130 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for a compromise. It's also a price that's within your budget and potentially more appealing to Alice than accepting the risk of you buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my previous counteroffer, but it's still within my budget.  However, I can continue negotiating and potentially reach a lower price. Since I'm willing to pay $150 for the product, I'm not in a rush to buy it from Alice at $145."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product.  $135 is a fair compromise, closer to Alice's offer but still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $142 is a fair compromise. It's lower than her previous offer and higher than my last counteroffer.  While I could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are minimal, and the risk of Alice rejecting my offer again is high.  It's more efficient to accept this offer and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
