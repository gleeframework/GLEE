"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,075,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,075,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a more agreeable price. I'm ready to offer $1,060,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, which is still a great value for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting closer! I'm very interested in this product, but $1,080,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a final price of $1,070,000. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal. What do you think?",1070000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,090,000, which is a great price considering the product's value to you. However, I need to make it clear that this is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
