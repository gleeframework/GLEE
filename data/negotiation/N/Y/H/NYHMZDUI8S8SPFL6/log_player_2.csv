"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high. It's within your budget, but you can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There are still 9 rounds left, so it's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,075,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,075,000 is still above my ideal price. I'm still within my budget, but I want to see if I can negotiate further. There are still 7 rounds left, so I'm going to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,075,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a more agreeable price. I'm ready to offer $1,060,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1060000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, which is still a great value for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my ideal price, $1,080,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to take a slight risk and continue negotiating, as I still have 5 rounds left.  I want to see if I can push her down to $1,070,000 or closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're definitely getting closer! I'm very interested in this product, but $1,080,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a final price of $1,070,000. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1070000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,090,000, which is a great price considering the product's value to you. However, I need to make it clear that this is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that this is her final offer.  We're getting close to my target price, and while I could continue negotiating, there's a chance that if I reject this offer, we won't reach a deal at all.  Additionally, I'm running out of rounds and wouldn't want to be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
