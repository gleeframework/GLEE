"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $10200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle at $10050. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",10050.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10050. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do better. I'm counteroffering at $10750. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
