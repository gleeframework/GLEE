"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects the value it will bring to your business.  Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1550000? This allows for some flexibility, but still ensures I receive a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1325000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1325000 is still not a price I can accept. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1450000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it also ensures I receive a fair price for the value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be reasonable. How about $1425000?  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's the very last offer I can make. If we don't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
