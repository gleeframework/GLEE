"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, though.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,250,000?  That's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $1,150,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to secure this valuable product. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,5,
