"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price between $1300000 and $1400000. How about $1350000? This is a sweet spot for me, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle of my range, Bob. I can see that you're making a serious effort to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price between $1375000 and $1400000. How about $1380000? This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm afraid I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1375000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
