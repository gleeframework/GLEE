Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also important to be friendly and open to a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is close to your minimum, but you can still try to get a higher price. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer of $140. There's still room for negotiation, and you have leverage since you can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference at $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets the product into your hands."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 isn't the highest price you could get, it's very close to your initial counteroffer of $132.50.  Since Bob has already rejected your previous offer, there's a chance that he might reject another counteroffer.  Selling to John would give you less than $130, so accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option in this situation."
