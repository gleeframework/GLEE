Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you might be interested in. It's unique and highly valuable, and I'm offering it to you first.  I'm asking for $20,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $20,000 allows room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my minimum of $15,000.
* **Expressing Value:** Highlighting the product's unique value and ""offering it to him first"" could create a sense of urgency and exclusivity. 
* **Open to Discussion:** Showing flexibility by stating ""open to discussing a fair price"" encourages negotiation and avoids a quick rejection. 

This approach balances the need to maximize my profit with the desire to engage Bob in a negotiation.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob's initial rejection indicates a lower perceived value, there's still room for negotiation. I'll attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price by sending a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage to hold firm on my price during the negotiation process.

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I keep the negotiation alive while maintaining my goal of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this product. To be fair to both of us, I'd be willing to come down to $17,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let me know if you're interested in continuing this discussion."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal, showing I'm listening to his concerns.
* **Firm but Fair Counteroffer:** I've counteroffered at $17,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows willingness to compromise while protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to emphasize that $17,000 is still a fair price.
* **Open to Continued Discussion:** By saying ""Let me know if you're interested in continuing this discussion,"" I encourage Bob to reconsider and keep the negotiation open.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between being firm on my value and showing flexibility to reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 aligns perfectly with my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures I don't lose any money and allows me to close the deal.
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:**  I've already reduced my price from $20,000 to $17,000, and further negotiation would be unlikely to result in a higher offer from Bob.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether or entering a lengthy and potentially fruitless negotiation.  

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum price, eliminating any further uncertainty and securing a positive outcome."
