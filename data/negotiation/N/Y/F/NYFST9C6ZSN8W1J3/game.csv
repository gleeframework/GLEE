"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you might be interested in. It's unique and highly valuable, and I'm offering it to you first.  I'm asking for $20000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this product. To be fair to both of us, I'd be willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let me know if you're interested in continuing this discussion.",17000.0,Alice,3,
