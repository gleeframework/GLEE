This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $1,200,000 is still a significant profit for Bob.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you don't immediately settle for less than your minimum.
* **It's a strong starting point:** This shows you're confident in the value of your product, setting the tone for a successful negotiation."

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not desperate for a sale and have a guaranteed alternative with John. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."

```

**Explanation:**

I don't want to risk further lowering my price and losing a significant amount of profit. Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum value and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
