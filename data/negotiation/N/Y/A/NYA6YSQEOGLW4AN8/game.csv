"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the price point of $1,000,000 to be a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its intrinsic value to me. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually agreeable price.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I need to be mindful of my budget, and I believe this revised offer is a reasonable compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value to you. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand this is your final offer, but $850,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $700,000 as a final attempt to reach an agreement. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find the best deal, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,7,
