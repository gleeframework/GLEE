"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I know you'll benefit greatly from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,500 is under your $15,000 limit, you can likely get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell as her offer is close to your maximum.  By rejecting her offer, you'll see if she's willing to go lower or can leverage John's offer to negotiate."
