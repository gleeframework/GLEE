{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see how willing Bob is to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to lower the price to $85? I believe this would still provide a good value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a little closer to $90. How about $88?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a bit more. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
