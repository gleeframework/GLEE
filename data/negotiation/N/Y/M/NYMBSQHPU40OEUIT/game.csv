"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $16,000 for the product. This is a fair price that's closer to my budget, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $16,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $16,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
