"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $825,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000. How about $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $787,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $800,000, which is the price John is offering. This would allow us to close the deal without me having to go through the trouble of selling to him.  Let me know if you're interested.",800000.0,Alice,5,
