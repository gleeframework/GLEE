"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This should hopefully encourage him to counteroffer and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $110. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $95 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of what you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $95 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum of $110 and within my comfort zone. It's better to close the deal and secure a sale than risk going through more rounds with an uncertain outcome.  The potential loss of $55 by selling to John outweighs the potential gain of a few more dollars with Bob."
