{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's a clear, concise offer:** It's easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 
* **It expresses confidence in the product:**  By highlighting its value, you subtly encourage Bob to consider the offer.

Remember,  this is just the start of the negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your leverage:** Showing you're not desperate to sell at a low price can incentivize Bob to come closer to your desired range.
* **Explore your options:**  You can make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually acceptable price before moving to John, who offers your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain a strong position:**  This offer is a compromise from your previous offer but still above Bob's current offer. This shows flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Reiterate the value:** Mentioning it's still a good deal for Bob emphasizes the product's worth and subtly pushes him towards accepting.
* **Direct and encouraging:** The message is clear, concise, and encourages Bob to respond.

Remember, this is still a negotiation.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $107.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has come up a bit, his offer of $107.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my leverage:** I can make a counteroffer and see if I can reach a mutually acceptable price before moving to John.
* **Explore my options:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I am showing him that I am not desperate to sell at a low price and that I am willing to hold out for a better deal.  This could potentially incentivize him to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference - how about $110?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny, and this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stick to your ground:**  Instead of giving in completely to Bob's offer, I'm holding firm on $110. This demonstrates that I'm not willing to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Frame it as a compromise:** By suggesting splitting the difference, I'm making it seem like a fair and mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Reiterate the value:** Highlighting the product's worth again subtly encourages Bob to see the value in my offer. 
* **Show flexibility:** Even though I'm not dropping my price much, the message shows that I'm willing to compromise.

This counteroffer is a strategic way to keep the negotiation going while still maintaining my desired price range."
