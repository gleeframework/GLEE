"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I know the product is worth more to me, and I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum of $12,000.  If he doesn't budge, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $11,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than his counteroffer. I hope this shows my willingness to negotiate, while still holding out for a better price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still low.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue to try to get a better price. I know the product is worth $12,000 to John, and I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to offer $10,500. It's a slight drop from my previous offer, but still a significant jump from Bob's offer. I hope to show that I am serious about negotiating but also not willing to sell for a price significantly lower than my minimum."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob has finally reached my minimum. But I'm not desperate to sell. I still have a guaranteed sale to John at a higher price.  I want to see if I can squeeze out even a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}

I'm going to go for a small increase to see if Bob is willing to budge.  I'm getting closer to the John deal, but I'll try one more time to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  I've reached the point where the risk of not closing the deal with Bob outweighs the potential reward of trying to get a few more dollars. John's offer guarantees me my minimum, and I'm comfortable with that."
