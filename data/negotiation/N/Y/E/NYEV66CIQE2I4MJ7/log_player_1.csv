Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

Here's why this is a good starting point:

* **Starts High, But Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $115 is ambitious but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to aim high initially as you can always come down in price later.
* **Gauges Bob's Interest:** This offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to buy. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially asked for more. If he negotiates, you can adjust your approach.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  Importantly, this offer keeps you well above your minimum selling price of $100, ensuring a profit even if Bob negotiates you down a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, you know the product is worth $120 to him. There's still room for negotiation. Accepting $100 now would leave potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $108?"",
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splits the Difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Maintains Profit Margin:**  $108 ensures you still make a decent profit over your minimum.
* **Tests Bob's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is truly anchored at $100 or if he's willing to move closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now increased his offer to $105.  While we could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting $105 secures a $5 profit over your guaranteed sale to John and represents a reasonable compromise. It's often better to secure a good deal than to risk losing a sale by being too aggressive in negotiations."
