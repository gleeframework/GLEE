Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob has an incentive to buy. Here's why:

* **Good profit:** I'm aiming for a $2,000 profit, which is a significant amount.
* **Attractive for Bob:**  He still gets a $1,000 value out of the deal, making it a worthwhile purchase for him.
* **Minimizes risk:** Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, so I won't be losing out."
