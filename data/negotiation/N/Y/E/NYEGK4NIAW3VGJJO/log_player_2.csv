"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth a considerable sum to you, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment. I'm willing to let you have it for a price that's still very favorable to both of us.  Let's discuss a price point that benefits us both.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's message is tempting, $950,000 is still a significant chunk of your budget. You know John is a guaranteed backup option at $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price, giving you a chance for greater savings."
