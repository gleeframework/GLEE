"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $110. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is lower than your maximum price, you can try to get a better deal. Alice is likely willing to go lower since the product's value to her is significantly less than her asking price."
