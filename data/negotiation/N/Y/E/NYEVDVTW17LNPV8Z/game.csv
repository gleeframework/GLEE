"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $130? It's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $135. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
