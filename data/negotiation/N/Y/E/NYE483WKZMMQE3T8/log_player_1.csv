Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my desired value of $1,200,000, but I'm willing to accept less than that if it means closing the deal.  

I'll evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired value and even lower than John's offer. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping to get a higher price but will also consider the risk of losing the deal to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above John's offer and closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is close to my desired value of $1,200,000.  While it's slightly lower than John's offer, I'm concerned about the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing both deals.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
