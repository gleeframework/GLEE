"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?

Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $115, you can likely negotiate further. Rejecting the offer and sending a counteroffer again is the best choice in this round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $108? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 108}
