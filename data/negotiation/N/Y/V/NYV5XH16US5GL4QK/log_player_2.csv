"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This still gives you a great deal, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
