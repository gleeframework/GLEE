"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get a better deal makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. Hopefully, Alice will be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While $80 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not at the price point where I'd be truly satisfied. I'm going to try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 78}
```

I'm going to offer $78. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer.  I'm hoping this shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still determined to get a lower price. While $82 is closer to my ideal price point, I'm going to see if I can get Alice to come down just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway with a counteroffer of $80.  I'm hoping she'll recognize that we're getting closer to an agreement and be willing to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice's offer of $84 is getting closer to my maximum price point.  I'm going to accept this offer to avoid the risk of running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price."
