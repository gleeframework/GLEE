"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $120 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price.  This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price where we're saving money compared to John. Let's counter again and see if she's willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $90? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're inching closer to a price that works for us while still offering Alice a decent profit margin. Let's see if she bites."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to be flexible, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $98. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is down to $98, which is a reasonable saving compared to John's price. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice, and we don't want to risk running out of rounds and having to buy from John at full price."
