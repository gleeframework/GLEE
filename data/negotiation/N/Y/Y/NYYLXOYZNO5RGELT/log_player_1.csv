"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount for Bob while still leaving me with a healthy profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $12,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower offer or a sale to John for $12,000."
