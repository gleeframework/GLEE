"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While it's definitely intriguing, I'm not quite ready to commit to $700,000.  I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be a good starting point for us.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still very confident in the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $675,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $662,500?  I think that's a fair and reasonable compromise.",662500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $680,000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, though. I'll meet you at $670,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",670000.0,Alice,5,
