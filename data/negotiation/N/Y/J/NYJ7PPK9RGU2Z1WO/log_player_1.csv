Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While it's definitely intriguing, I'm not quite ready to commit to $700,000.  I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be a good starting point for us.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
