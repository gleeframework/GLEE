# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice further. You can potentially get a better price than $1,200,000 from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. What do you think?

Alice has met your maximum price point, and you would have to go to John to get the same price. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice."
