"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and importance to both of us, I propose a price of $9,500 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to you and my desire to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to you, you can potentially save more by rejecting the offer and trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the special price, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $8,500? I believe this price would be fair for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a middle ground. I am willing to accept $9,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to you while allowing for a reasonable profit for me. I hope this proposal suits your budget and we can move forward with the transaction.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While there's still some room for negotiation, accepting the offer means getting the product for $1,000 less than Bob's maximum price and $500 less than Alice's previous offer.  Continuing to negotiate might save a bit more, but it risks losing the deal entirely or having to pay the full $10,000 to John.  The risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
