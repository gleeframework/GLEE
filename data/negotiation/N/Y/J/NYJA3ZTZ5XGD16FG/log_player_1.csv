This offer sets the price slightly below Bob's perceived value, making it attractive to him while still giving me a good profit. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising the price slightly to $105. This is a compromise that still gives me a good profit while being closer to Bob's desired price."
