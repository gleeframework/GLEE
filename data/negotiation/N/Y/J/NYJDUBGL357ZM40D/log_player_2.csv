"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $165?

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $165 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum threshold of $120. I'm going to reject her offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for us to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $130. It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and your asking price. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
