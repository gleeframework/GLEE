Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to him, and gives him room to negotiate if he wishes. However, it's still a good deal for me, earning me a substantial profit while leaving room for potential counteroffers."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good deal for me, and I believe it's reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting."
