Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $145. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob, exceeding the $150 I can get from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $145 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, while still staying above my minimum.
* **Avoid Scaring Bob Away:**  Offering it at my absolute minimum ($150) or higher might make Bob immediately lose interest without even considering a counter-offer. 

This strategy balances my desire for profit with the need to make the offer appealing enough for Bob to consider."
