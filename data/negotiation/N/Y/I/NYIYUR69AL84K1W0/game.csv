"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1225000? It's a compromise that I think works for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
