Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $140 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $130. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a final attempt at reaching an agreement. I am willing to sell the product for $132. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $132 is only $12 over my maximum budget, and it's likely the best I'm going to get from her. While I could keep negotiating, it's getting close to the end of the rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Buying from John for $120 is still an option, but it's better to try and get a slightly better deal with Alice."
