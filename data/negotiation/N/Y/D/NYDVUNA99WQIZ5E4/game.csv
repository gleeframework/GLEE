"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I understand its value, my budget allows me to pay no more than $950,000 for it. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but $950,000 falls short of what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I am unable to agree to $1,150,000. I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise, which is closer to my maximum budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
