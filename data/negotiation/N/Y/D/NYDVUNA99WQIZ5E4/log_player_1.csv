"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, the message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential,"" aiming to anchor Bob's perception at a higher level.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states this is a ""starting point for negotiations,"" signaling flexibility and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy balances my desire for maximum profit with the need to engage Bob in a meaningful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I understand its value, my budget allows me to pay no more than $950,000 for it. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation, especially since he expressed a desire to reach a ""mutually beneficial agreement."" I'm willing to counter-offer in the hopes of closing the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but $950,000 falls short of what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've significantly lowered my asking price from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  By proposing a price halfway between our previous offers, I'm signaling a desire to find a fair compromise.
* **Value Reaffirmation:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to prevent him from anchoring too low. 

This counter-offer aims to keep the negotiation moving while still pushing for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I am unable to agree to $1,150,000. I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise, which is closer to my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting this offer secures me the desired profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation dragging on."
