"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $75. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better deal from Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $75 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($60), I aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message remains positive and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This counteroffer leaves ample room for negotiation and compromise between $60 and Alice's desired $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $70. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. While $70 is better, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I don't want to accept too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $65? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Instead of jumping back up significantly, I'm offering a smaller increase from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise but also standing firm on getting a good deal.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward and suggests a specific price point, aiming for a quicker resolution.
* **""Fair Price"" Framing:**  By framing $65 as a ""fair price,"" I subtly nudge Alice to see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $65 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $68. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $68 is a good price, saving me $12 off the original price and $12 off John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significant savings. Alice is moving in small increments now. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation any further might not be worth the potential small savings."
