"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's still a great deal for a product worth $120 to you. Let's meet in the middle!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
