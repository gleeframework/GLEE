"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its value to you and still allows me a good profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm proposing $950,000 as a final compromise. This price allows both of us to achieve a fair outcome.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,
