Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking $115 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. It opens the negotiation while keeping some room for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $105, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
I'm offering $110, which is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum of $120, and I've already made two concessions.  I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'll sell the product to John for $120. It's the best outcome for me at this point."
