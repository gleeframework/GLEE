,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but $110 is my absolute minimum.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $110. How about $105? That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",107.5,Alice,5,
