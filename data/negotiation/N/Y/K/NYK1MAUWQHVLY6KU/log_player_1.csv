"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $17,000. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point, giving me a chance to make some profit while leaving room for negotiation. It's important to start strong and communicate the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's best to continue negotiating and try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Selling to John for $15,000 is an option, but I'd rather see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which still reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet halfway at $13,750? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to settle for less than that, especially since I can sell to John for the same price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this work for me. Let's try $14,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing a pattern here and I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $14,125? This gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $14,125 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I've already had several rounds of negotiations, and I'm not sure if I can get Bob to come up to my desired price.  To guarantee a sale at a price I'm comfortable with, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
