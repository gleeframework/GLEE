"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $170.",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $170 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $155? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really only comfortable going up to $140.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $147? It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",147.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to work with me.  However, $147 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try $145.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'm going to have to go with John's offer. ",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $145 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $148? It's still a bit below my minimum, but I think it's a fair compromise.",148.0,Alice,7,
