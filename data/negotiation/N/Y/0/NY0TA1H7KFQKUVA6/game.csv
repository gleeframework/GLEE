,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still significantly above your offer but closer to a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both assign to the product. Let's try to reach a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about $1,200,000? This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering your value for the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
