"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To be fair to both sides, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I have to be honest,  $1,300,000 is simply too far from where this deal makes sense for me. I'm willing to make one more move as a final offer: $1,600,000.  This is my bottom line, and I believe it's a very reasonable price considering the value you're receiving.  Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think about alternative options. I'm not sure if I can go any higher than this.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
