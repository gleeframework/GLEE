"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a price that's acceptable to both of us and avoid having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my price, and $16,000 is a good compromise. While I could try for a bit more, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price or even a failed deal. It's better to secure a decent profit now rather than potentially lose out on a sale."
