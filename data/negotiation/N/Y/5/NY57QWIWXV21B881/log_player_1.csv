Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Knowing your Bottom Line:**  You have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 (John). This means any offer Bob accepts above $12,000 is profitable for you.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** By starting at $15,000, Bob has the opportunity to counter-offer. This gives you information about his willingness to pay and allows you to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and willingness to negotiate."
