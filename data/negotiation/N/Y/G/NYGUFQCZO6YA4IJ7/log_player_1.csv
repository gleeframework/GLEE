Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. This offer represents a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I believe the product is worth more than $700,000. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $700,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, but still allows you to acquire a product of substantial value.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let's try to find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, $775,000 is still too low. I'm willing to compromise further but I'm not yet ready to accept that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
