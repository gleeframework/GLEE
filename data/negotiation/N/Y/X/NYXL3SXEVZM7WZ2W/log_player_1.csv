Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common strategy in negotiations to leave room for compromise. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price of $105.  This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still keeping my minimum value in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum.  While I'd like to get a higher price, I'm confident that selling to John for $100 is the best option in this situation.  It guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
