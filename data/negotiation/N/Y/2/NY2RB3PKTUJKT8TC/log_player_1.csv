Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1500000. Can we discuss the potential value of the product and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it seems like Bob is willing to meet me there.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation was uncertain."
