"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be incredibly valuable to your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair reflection of the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $1,100,000 from Alice versus $1,200,000 from John. 
* **You still save money.**  You're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000."
