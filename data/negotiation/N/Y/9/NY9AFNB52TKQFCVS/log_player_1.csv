Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,150,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he has incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a deal.
* **It allows for flexibility:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response and your assessment of his willingness to pay.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. A too-high initial offer might scare him away, while a too-low offer might make you lose potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is more than John's offer, it's still below your desired profit. There is room to negotiate further with Bob. You can try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. By offering $1,100,000, you are showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit above John's offer.  

This counteroffer is likely to be attractive to Bob, as it is closer to his desired price than your previous offer.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation if he still insists on a lower price."
