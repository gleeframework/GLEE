"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  Since Bob's maximum value is $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate.  A counteroffer might push Alice closer to her value of $1,000,000.  

Buying from John immediately would be a less advantageous decision at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, while still being above Alice's minimum value. This strategy aims to incentivize Alice to accept the offer while still saving Bob a substantial amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than what Bob would pay John ($1,200,000) and closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, saving Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but there is a risk that Alice might reject any further counteroffers.  The potential gains from further negotiation may not outweigh the risk of losing the deal."
