"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. My initial offer is $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but selling to John is always an option if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and lets get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $95 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up from his initial $80 offer to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's getting close to the number of rounds, so I'm happy to accept this offer."
