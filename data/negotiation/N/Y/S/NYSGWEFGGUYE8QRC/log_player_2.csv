"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer again, but stay above $6,000 to avoid pushing her away."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go without sacrificing my profit margin. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice is holding firm, and $7,200 is a reasonable price. It's better to accept her offer now rather than risk her going higher or losing the deal altogether."
