"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal range. He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial discount. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  A $1,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is significant. It shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants a good deal.
* **Within Budget:** $8,500 is still within Bob's $10,000 limit and leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message is positive and invites Alice to continue the conversation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above what Bob wants to pay. He's aiming for a price closer to $8,500.
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate. He can try to meet Alice halfway again, or propose a slightly higher price.
* **John as a Backup:** Bob has John as a fallback option, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product.  I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway Again:**  Bob is again trying to find a middle ground, this time offering $8,750, which is halfway between his previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's offer of $9,000.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes a desire to close the deal and highlights the fairness of the offer.
* **Building Pressure:** By suggesting a ""good deal for both,"" Bob subtly adds a sense of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $8900. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $8,900 is a good price for Bob. It's within his budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer of $10,000.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product at a reasonable price before time runs out and he's forced to buy from John."
