"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial discount. However, $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to pay $8750 for the product.  I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $8900. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,5,
