{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $1,000,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant portion of the potential profit. It's a strong opening position that signals value but still offers Bob a substantial gain."
