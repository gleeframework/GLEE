"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
Let's start with a significant counteroffer.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to my goal, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

Let's inch closer to Alice's offer, but still try to stay below $1,050,000.  $1,025,000 shows we're serious about negotiating but are still willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering $1,075,000, which is only $25,000 more than my last counteroffer.  It's time to accept. This deal is significantly better than buying from John, and further negotiation might just be pushing my luck."
