"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is cutting it too close to my minimum.  I could go down to $11,000, but that's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
