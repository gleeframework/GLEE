"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less to me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,050,000?  This price would still give you a great deal and allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for you, Alice. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000. How about $1,000,000? Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
