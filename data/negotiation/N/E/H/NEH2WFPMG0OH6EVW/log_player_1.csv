"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $85 is still below my minimum price of $80, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? This price is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $85 was a bit too low, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.5 is above my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $95.  I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $92.50. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for you.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $91.25. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $91.25 is a little below what I hoped to get, it's still a good profit and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
