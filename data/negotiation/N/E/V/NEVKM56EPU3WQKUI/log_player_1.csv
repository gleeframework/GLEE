"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value than mine, but it's still a decent profit above my minimum.  There's room for negotiation, but John is a guaranteed win. 

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
