Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.
