"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this offer in the first round. However, it establishes a strong starting point and lets Bob know I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm confident that I can convince Bob to come closer to my asking price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,500. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I believe I can push for a slightly better price. Bob is clearly interested in the product and has been increasing his offers, so I'm confident we can reach a deal closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $10,250.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it will be enough to convince Bob to accept. We're now only $250 apart, and with limited rounds remaining, this is a good opportunity to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,750.  While this is slightly below my minimum of $10,000, it's a good deal considering the limited rounds remaining.  It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
