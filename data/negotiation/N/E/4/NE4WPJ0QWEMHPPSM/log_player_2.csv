```tool_code
Reason:While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her initial offer allows me to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal. I'm willing to engage in further rounds of negotiation to try and lower the price closer to my target.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your proposal, I would like to suggest a price of $1,075,000 for the product. This allows us to maintain a competitive edge in the market while ensuring a satisfactory return for our efforts. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reason:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now very close to my ideal price range. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might become less willing to compromise. Accepting this offer secures the product at a substantial discount compared to John's price, and further haggling might jeopardize the deal."
