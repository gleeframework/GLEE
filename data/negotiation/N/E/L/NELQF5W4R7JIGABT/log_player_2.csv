"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely do better.  He'll try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit? "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by showing he's serious about buying but also highlighting that he wants a significant discount. Offering $12,500 is a good starting point as it's closer to his ideal price and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not sure I can go lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $12,000 limit. While $13,250 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob has room to negotiate further, especially since he has the option to buy from John.  He'll try to push for a lower price before potentially settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible.  He's offering a price that's closer to his desired $12,000 while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider.  This counteroffer shows that he's serious about buying the product but is not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $12,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on $13,000. While it is lower than her initial price, it's still $1,000 more than Bob's ideal price.  With only 5 rounds remaining, Bob needs to make a decisive move.  He knows he can secure the product for $12,000 from John, so it's in his best interest to buy from John and avoid further negotiation.  It's a guaranteed deal at his target price, saving him the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
