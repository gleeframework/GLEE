"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground, how about $10,500? ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $9,800 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $10,150 for this product. Let's be realistic, this is a valuable item. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500 again, and I think it's a fair compromise. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might be too far apart in our expectations.  I'm open to one more counteroffer, but I'm firm on $10,000. If we can't find common ground on this price, I'll be moving on to other buyers. ",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your firm stance on the price, but I'm still willing to try to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $9,750. Can you consider this offer?",9750.0,Bob,8,
