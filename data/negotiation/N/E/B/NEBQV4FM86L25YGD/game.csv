"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product.  That's my absolute bottom line. Take it or leave it.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can strike a deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
