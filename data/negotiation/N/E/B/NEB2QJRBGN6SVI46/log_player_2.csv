"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price range.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, and Alice is offering $12,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **You haven't exhausted all options with Alice.**  It's best to try and negotiate further before resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a reasonable price:** $10,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a range where you can potentially make a deal.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** The message conveys your interest in buying the product and finding a middle ground.
* **Keep room for further negotiation:** By not offering the absolute minimum, you leave space for Alice to counter with a price that might be acceptable to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going down to $10,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget:** $11,000 is still less than the maximum you're willing to pay.
* **Negotiation has moved closer to your desired price:** While not your ideal price, it's a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer.
* **Further negotiation may not yield a much better result:** It's possible that Alice will be unwilling to go lower, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Buying from John is still a less favorable option:** You'd save $4,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
