Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. What would you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it seems unlikely he'll reach the minimum I need. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
