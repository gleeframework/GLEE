"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. What would you say?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
