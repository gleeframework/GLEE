"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice's product is worth $800,000 to her, so there's a significant gap between her value and the current offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer offers a price of $850,000, which is halfway between Alice's value of $800,000 and the initial offer of $950,000. This represents a significant discount while still potentially being acceptable to Alice. It also shows Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than the initial offer of $950,000, which is unfavorable. While it's still lower than John's price, it's getting closer to that point. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of trying to find a middle ground. This counteroffer is in between his previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's current offer of $1,000,000. It shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer has risen again, and is now getting uncomfortably close to John's price.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of getting stuck with a price closer to John's is high.  At this point, it's best to accept the sure thing and buy from John."
