"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering me this product.  However, $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in purchasing it for $10000. This reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $18000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I put into acquiring it. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $15000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $15000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $17000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my original price. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
