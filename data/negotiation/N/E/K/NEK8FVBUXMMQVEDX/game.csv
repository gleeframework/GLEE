"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you thinking of me, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there with $13,500.  How about we split the difference and I pay $12,750?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,750. I'm willing to go slightly higher, to $13,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
