"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's something that I'm confident could generate substantial returns for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a price point that I believe is fair and beneficial for both of us.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
