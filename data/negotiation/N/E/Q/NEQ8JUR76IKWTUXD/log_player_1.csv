Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""significant value,"" Alice aims to subtly anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth above $8,000. 
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 from John. This eliminates the risk of completely losing the sale. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice may need to adjust her price during further negotiation."
