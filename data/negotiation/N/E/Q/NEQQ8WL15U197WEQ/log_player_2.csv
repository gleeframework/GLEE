{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While I have some rounds left, I've reached a point where the risk of further negotiation not leading to a favorable outcome outweighs the potential for a slightly better price.  John's offer is my safety net, and it's time to take it."
