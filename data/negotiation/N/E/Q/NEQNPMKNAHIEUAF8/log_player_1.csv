Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the ""opportunity"" and ""value"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time and flexibility. If you need to sell quickly, a lower initial offer might be more practical."
