Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefit for Bob (""great deal"") to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is not my absolute minimum, so I can still negotiate if Bob rejects it.
* **Keeping John as an option:** I'm aware of John's offer of $15,000 and will use it as a fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:** I believe I can still push for a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000, so there's no immediate risk in rejecting Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're on a budget. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer, I'm providing a counter-offer with a clear explanation.  
* **Moving towards a compromise:**  My counter-offer of $10,500 is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still being significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open to negotiation.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $10,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject his offer, there's no guarantee that he will offer a higher price in the next round.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for $15,000 is too high. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice in this situation, as it maximizes my profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
