``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum of $12,000 while leaving Bob feeling like he got a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable investment for your business."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target. There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm not giving up yet!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
