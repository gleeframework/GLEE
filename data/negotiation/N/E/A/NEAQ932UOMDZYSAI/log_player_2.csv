It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, there's room to bargain."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is closer to my target price of $900,000.  It's a good deal considering my maximum budget is $1,200,000 and I can save $250,000."
