"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to my budget as possible. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,750? That's as high as I can go without going over my budget. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a little lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more. How about $8,875?  That's just a little bit more, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
