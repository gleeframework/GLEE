"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob is willing to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, it's not a good deal considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to risk further negotiation to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter with $150. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's a significant increase from his initial offer and only $10 less than what John is offering. With limited rounds remaining, it's better to secure a sale at a decent price than to risk getting nothing."
