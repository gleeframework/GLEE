"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident the product's value is higher than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,300,000, so I'm offering it to you for $1,275,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
