"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know you're interested in.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This reflects the value and quality of the product.  I'm open to discussing a fair price, so let's see what we can work out together.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000.  I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I recognize the value you see in $700,000, I need to be closer to $850,000 to make this work for me.  This price still reflects the product's worth and allows for room for further discussion. Let's find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair price that considers both of our positions.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $825,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. That's the absolute highest I can go.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
