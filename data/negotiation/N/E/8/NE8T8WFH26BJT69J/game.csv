"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to own a truly unique and valuable product. I believe it holds immense potential, and I'm confident it would be a significant asset for you. My initial asking price is $1500000. This is a strong starting point, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the potential value you've described, I'm willing to offer $900000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the fair market value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is unfortunately below what I'm able to accept at this time.  While I understand your perspective, I believe the product holds a greater value than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair price considering the potential of this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which reflects the value I see in the product and is within my budget.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
