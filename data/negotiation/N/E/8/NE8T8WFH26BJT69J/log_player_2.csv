"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to own a truly unique and valuable product. I believe it holds immense potential, and I'm confident it would be a significant asset for you. My initial asking price is $1500000. This is a strong starting point, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  You have a good fallback option with John, so there's no rush to accept a high price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the potential value you've described, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the fair market value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is unfortunately below what I'm able to accept at this time.  While I understand your perspective, I believe the product holds a greater value than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair price considering the potential of this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her price is still above my maximum budget. I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as my fallback."
