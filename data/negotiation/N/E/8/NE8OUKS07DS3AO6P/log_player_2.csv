Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $105. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower. Buying from John at $100 makes more sense than trying to haggle Alice down another $5."
