"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $140?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $160. I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $160 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $155.  That feels like a good compromise that we can both be happy with.",155.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $157.50. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",157.5,Alice,5,
