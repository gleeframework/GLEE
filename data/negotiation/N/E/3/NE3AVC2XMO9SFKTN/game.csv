,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $105?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to lower the price to $115. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll really appreciate the quality of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $115 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $112.50. It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
