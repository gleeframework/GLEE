,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm offering you the product for $1,550,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,550,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,375,000 is still not enough for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,450,000 as a final compromise. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this transaction.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,375,000 and $1,450,000, which is $1,425,000. Can we consider this price?",1425000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $1,425,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to stay above $1,450,000. I'm offering you the product for $1,475,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair and achievable compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
