"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1500000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about $1750000?  This gives us both room to negotiate, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
