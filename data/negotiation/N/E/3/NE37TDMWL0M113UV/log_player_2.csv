Round 9
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting very close, but Alice is still not budging below $10,000. You only have one round left, and it's unlikely she'll come down to your desired price.  You're better off buying from John for $8,000, which is within your budget and avoids the risk of not getting the product at all."
