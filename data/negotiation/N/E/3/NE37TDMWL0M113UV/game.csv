"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  This is the maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
