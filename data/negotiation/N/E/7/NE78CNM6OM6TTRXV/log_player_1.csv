Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You have a significant advantage knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering it at $1,300,000 allows you to capture a large portion of the value while still leaving Bob with a $200,000 gain. This is a classic win-win negotiation strategy.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John ($800,000), so you can confidently aim high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This assumes you cannot reveal your minimum price to Bob. In a real negotiation, factors like Bob's negotiation skills and your relationship with him could influence your approach."
