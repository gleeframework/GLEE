"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $10,500? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a limited budget, but $9,800 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,200. That's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short. How about we try $9,500 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,6,
