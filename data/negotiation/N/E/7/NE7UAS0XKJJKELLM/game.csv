"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $960000, but I need to think about it for a moment. Let me see if I can do any better. How about I come back with a final offer that's slightly higher than $960000? I'll need to check with some people and get back to you. Can you hold off on making a decision for now?",970000.0,Alice,9,
