"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you my product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a price of $20,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $10,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you do $11,500? I think that would be a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tighter budget.  $11,500 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about $14,000?  That's a significant discount from my original offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, I can get a similar product for $12,000 elsewhere. If you're able to come down to that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I might have to go with the other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
While I could try to push for more, Bob is now very close to my minimum price and has presented an alternative option. Accepting ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
