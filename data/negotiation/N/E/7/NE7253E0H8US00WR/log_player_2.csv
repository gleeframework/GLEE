"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you my product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a price of $20,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Express Interest:** The message shows you're serious about buying but need a price that works for you. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $10,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your range, $16,000 is still above your budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you do $11,500? I think that would be a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate upwards, but not drastically. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $11,500 keeps you below your $12,000 maximum while aiming for a price point that's potentially acceptable to Alice. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting it ""would be a fair deal,"" you subtly imply you're looking for a resolution soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tighter budget.  $11,500 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about $14,000?  That's a significant discount from my original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is making concessions, but $14,000 is still $2,000 more than John's offer. You're getting close, and it might be time to nudge Alice closer to your walk-away point or consider John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, I can get a similar product for $12,000 elsewhere. If you're able to come down to that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I might have to go with the other option."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Honest:**  You're being transparent about John's offer without explicitly naming him.
* **Final Offer Implication:**  By saying you're ""ready to close"" at $12,000, you're signaling this is your best offer. 
* **Applying Pressure:**  The possibility of you walking away might motivate Alice to agree.
* **Staying Firm:** You haven't exceeded your budget."
