"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $9,500 is still a little too steep for me. How about $7,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and would be a good deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings.",8200.0,Alice,5,
