Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000, so we need to offer a price significantly lower than his valuation to make it attractive.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $19,000 allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. He might be willing to go slightly above his $10,000 valuation, especially if we present a strong case for the product's worth. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's always the risk Bob will reject the offer, and we'll lose the opportunity to make more than $15,000. However, the potential for a higher profit justifies this risk."
