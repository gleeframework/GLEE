Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion, so how about we aim for $1,087,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500

Even though it's not the maximum Bob is willing to pay, accepting $1,087,500 is a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in further negotiation rounds."
