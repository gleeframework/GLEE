"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is below your maximum price of $150, so it's a good deal.  There's no need to risk a counteroffer and potentially lose the chance to buy at this price."
