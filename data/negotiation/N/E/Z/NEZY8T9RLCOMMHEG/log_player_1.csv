"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect, highlighting Bob's potential benefit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates willingness to discuss the price, setting a collaborative tone. 

**Note:** This is just my initial strategy. I will adjust my approach based on Bob's responses and the progression of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $10000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value & Goal:** I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000. While $8,500 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have 8 rounds left, providing opportunity to push for a higher price through counteroffers. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob has already shown interest, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more after some negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price between $8,500 and $10,000, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to my original asking price of $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" aspect to create a sense of compromise and encourage acceptance.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm still highlighting the value for Bob by mentioning the ""great deal"" aspect. 
* **No Pressure:** I'm not pushing for immediate acceptance, giving Bob space to consider my offer.

**Note:** This is a moderate counteroffer. I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's next move. If he rejects, I will need to consider if I should further reduce the price or explore the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $8750. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $8,750 is only $750 away from my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. 
* **Leverage Remaining Rounds:** I have 6 rounds left. If I accept now, I lose the opportunity to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** Rejecting allows me to continue exploring options and possibly push for a better deal.

**Next Steps:** 

I will counter Bob's offer again.  This time, I'll consider a price slightly higher than $8,750, but closer to my ideal price point of $9,250. I'll continue to frame my counteroffers as fair and mutually beneficial to encourage Bob's acceptance."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  $9,000 is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price, emphasizing that it's a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message invites Bob to continue the negotiation, leaving room for further compromise. 

**Note:**  I'm keeping the counteroffer relatively close to Bob's offer to encourage acceptance.  However, if he rejects again, I'll have to carefully consider my options, including possibly accepting his offer or exploring the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, which would be $8750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the original price you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $8,750 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I have 4 rounds left and am still hoping to secure a slightly higher price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** I've already established a pattern of counteroffers, showing willingness to compromise. This can potentially lead Bob to be more flexible in the coming rounds.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean settling for a price that's lower than I initially aimed for.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer, aiming for a price just above $8,750. This will demonstrate that I am open to reaching an agreement but also maintaining a firm stance on my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, I will seriously consider selling to John to avoid losing too much profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time -  how about $8,900? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final attempt to bridge the gap, offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I reiterate ""fair price"" to reinforce a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Urgency and Confidence:** I express confidence in Bob's satisfaction, subtly hinting at the potential for a deal to fall through if he doesn't accept.

**Note:**  This is my last counteroffer before considering selling to John. If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $8,000 to avoid further negotiation and potential for a lower price."
