"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $10000 to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to my original asking price of $10000. How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $8750. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $9000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, which would be $8750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the original price you mentioned.",8750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time -  how about $8900? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",8900.0,Alice,7,
