"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $120 is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* While Alice's offer is above the product's value to her ($80), it's still within your budget ($150) and offers a saving compared to John's price."
