Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it might be rejected. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while also showing the value I place on the product.  I'll be prepared to adjust based on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer and try to negotiate closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product highly. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from him, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
