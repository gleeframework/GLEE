,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $160, so I can offer it to you for $170. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",170.0,Alice,5,

"I've already offered you a price of $167.50, and you're asking me to go back to $160? I'm not willing to go back on that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $167.50 and $160, so I can offer it to you for $163.75. This is my final offer.",163.75,Alice,9,

"I've made a lot of concessions already, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $163.75. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that normally costs $25. So, the total value you'll get is $163.75 for the product plus $25 for the accessory, making it a total of $188.75. This is my final offer.",163.75,Alice,11,
