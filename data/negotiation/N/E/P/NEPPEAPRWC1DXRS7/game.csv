"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product is interesting, I think that price is a little high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that the initial price may have been a bit steep, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about $750,000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us, I think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $795,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $772,500? That's a fair deal.",772500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $785,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $780,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",780000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I can do $775,000.  Let's make this deal happen.",775000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'll offer you the product for $777,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach a deal.",777500.0,Alice,9,
