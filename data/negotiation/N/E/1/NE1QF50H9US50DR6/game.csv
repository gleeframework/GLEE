"Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This price still reflects the product's value to you, while also providing a reasonable profit for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to me and the potential for a reasonable profit for you, I'm willing to offer $9,500.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This price is still slightly above your original offer, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to maximize your profit, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $9,750. This represents a significant compromise for me, and it's fair considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal with a final agreement.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,900. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9900.0,Alice,7,
