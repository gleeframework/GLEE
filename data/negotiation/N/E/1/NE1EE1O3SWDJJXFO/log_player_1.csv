Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering it's the most I'm willing to spend.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,125,000 is still too low for me.

This is a fair price, considering the value and the fact that we've already been negotiating for several rounds."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
