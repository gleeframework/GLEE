"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering it's the most I'm willing to spend.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  I can't quite do $1,250,000.  How about we settle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,125,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $1,175,000 for this product. This is a fair price, considering the value and the fact that we've already been negotiating for several rounds.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
