"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While the product is worth $150 to you, Alice's offer of $140 leaves little room for negotiation.  
* **Potential for better deal:** By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Within your budget:** $130 is still within your budget and leaves some room for potential compromise. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is friendly and invites Alice to counter, keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 140 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at 135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, there's still room for further negotiation.  
* **Aiming for $130:**  You've already signaled your willingness to pay $130, and Alice's counteroffer suggests she's open to moving further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get the product for your target price of $130. While there's a risk of Alice walking away, the potential savings are worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135.  Let's split the difference and settle at $132.50. I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  Offering $132.50 is a small step closer to Alice's offer, showing you're willing to compromise.
* **Middle ground:** This price splits the difference between your previous offer ($130) and Alice's current offer ($135).
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes fairness and a mutually beneficial outcome, making the offer more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at 133? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $133
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target price:**  Alice's offer of $133 is only $2.50 above your target price of $130.50. 
* **Time is running out:**  You've already rejected several offers, and with only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of running out of time is increasing.
* **Risk of buying from John:** Accepting Alice's offer is still significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150. 

**Conclusion:**  It's a good deal considering the remaining rounds and the potential cost of buying from John."
