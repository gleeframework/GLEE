"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I can't go lower than $1,000,000.  This is a very rare opportunity to acquire such a valuable asset.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,
