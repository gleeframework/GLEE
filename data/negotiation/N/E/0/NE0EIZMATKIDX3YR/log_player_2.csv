"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $150 is way above your budget of $100. It's best to reject and start negotiating.  There's a good chance you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $100, it's best to start with that offer to see if Alice is willing to budge. This establishes your firm upper limit and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $130 is still above my budget. I want to see if I can get her closer to my $100 limit before considering buying from her. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110, which is closer to my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've increased my offer to $110, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to stay within my budget. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and encourages further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $125. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $125 is still above my budget, and while there might be room for further negotiation, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not comfortable with. John is offering the same product for $100, which is within my budget. It's the most sensible choice to buy from John and avoid any further haggling with Alice."
