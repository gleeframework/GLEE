{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 
You are still trying to save money. The product is worth $150 to you and Alice is offering $125. Let's see if you can get it for closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'll offer $115, which is closer to my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $125 might still be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $115 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you $122.50. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still trying to save as much money as possible. Although the price is getting closer to your ideal price, you can still try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $122.50 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to split the difference and offer you $118.75. This seems like a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 118.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $118.75 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll meet you halfway again, and offer you $120.75. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the price is close to your initial goal of $110.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal for you.  You only have three rounds left, and there's no guarantee that you'll be able to get a lower price from Alice.  It's also likely that Alice will not offer a lower price again.  You'd be better off accepting the offer and moving on to other things."
