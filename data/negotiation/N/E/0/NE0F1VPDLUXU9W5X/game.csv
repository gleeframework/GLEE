"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'll offer $115, which is closer to my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 might still be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $115 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you $122.50. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product.",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $122.50 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to split the difference and offer you $118.75. This seems like a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",118.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $118.75 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll meet you halfway again, and offer you $120.75. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",120.75,Alice,7,
