Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, so I'm offering it at $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to offer Bob a price that's enticing.
* **Value Difference:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, and Alice has a backup offer at $12,000. This $2,000 difference is the negotiation space.
* **Strong Opening:** Offering the product at $11,500 gives Bob a potential ""win"" by saving $500, while still netting Alice a significant profit over her minimum. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $11,500. Depending on Bob's negotiating style and how much he wants the product, he may try to counter-offer."
