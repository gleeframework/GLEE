Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but want to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500.  This is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm still hoping to get a bit more from Bob, the negotiation isn't moving quickly. I'm concerned that we'll go back and forth for a while without reaching an agreement.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'll choose to sell to him now."
