Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $105 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you consider $95? I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $100? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit out of my range. I'm ready to pay $90 for this product. Let's close the deal at this price.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $92? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",92.0,Alice,7,
