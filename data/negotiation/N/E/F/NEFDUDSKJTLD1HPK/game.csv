"Alice, your product seems great, but $1,500,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's make a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,050,000, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and dedicated support package, which is normally valued at $50,000. This brings the total value to $1,150,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the added value.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
