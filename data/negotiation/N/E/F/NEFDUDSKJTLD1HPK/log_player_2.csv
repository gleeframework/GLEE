Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and dedicated support package, which is normally valued at $50,000. This brings the total value to $1,150,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the added value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice's offer is still too high, even with the added value.  It's better for me to buy the product from John at $1,000,000. It's a sure deal, and I'm saving money."
