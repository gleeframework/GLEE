Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  However, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not risking too much by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above the price John is willing to pay. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from him, and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiations."
