Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit below my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a good relationship.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
