"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or choose to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows that the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay $9,500, which is still more than his maximum budget of $10,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price for both parties. This counteroffer will hopefully encourage Alice to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offer, it is still above his maximum budget of $10,000. He knows he can get the product from John for $10,000, so it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
