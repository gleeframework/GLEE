Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
