Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I can still try to get more.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or  have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $920,000 is getting closer to what I want, I think I can still get a better deal. I have a few rounds left and the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not in a rush to settle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $920,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $935,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $935,000. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for more.  I'm confident that I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds, or I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer of $915,000.  While it's tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $912,500. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer still below my desired price, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  The risk of getting a lower offer from Bob or not reaching a deal at all is too high, especially since I'm so close to my minimum price."
