"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 for the product. I'm interested in it, but I have a budget in mind.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's find common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $100. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
