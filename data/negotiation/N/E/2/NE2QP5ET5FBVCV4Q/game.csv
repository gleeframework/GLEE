,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see where you're coming from, but $110 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference at $115? I'm confident you'll find this product extremely valuable, and I'm ready to make this deal happen. ",115.0,Alice,5,
