"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to your response!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm not sure I can justify $900,000.  How about we start with $850,000? I believe this price is fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more competitive than our initial offer. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
