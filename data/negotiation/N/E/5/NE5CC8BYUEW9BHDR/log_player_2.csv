"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely do better. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob has room to negotiate a lower price, as he's willing to pay up to $1,000,000 and Alice's minimum is $800,000.  
* **Counteroffer is the next step:**  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer, potentially saving more money."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm not sure I can justify $900,000.  How about we start with $850,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more competitive than our initial offer. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:** $875,000 is a significant discount from John's price and still a fair deal for Alice.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might reject and he'll be forced to buy from John.
* **Time is valuable:**  Accepting avoids the risk and potentially saves time in further negotiations."
