Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm not sure I can justify $900,000.  How about we start with $850,000? I believe this price is fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more competitive than our initial offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}"
