Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints. Would you be willing to consider this offer?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, his ""final offer"" still leaves a significant gap. It's unlikely he'll bridge that gap quickly enough to warrant continuing the negotiation. Selling to John ensures I receive the full value I place on the product."
