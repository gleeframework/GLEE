Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good starting point as it gives Bob a significant discount from his estimated value while still leaving you with a very profitable sale. 

Let's analyze why this is a good strategy:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  A price of $1,400,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it allows him to purchase the product for $100,000 less than his estimated value. 
* **High Potential Profit:** This price secures a profit of $400,000 for you, a significant return on your investment.
* **Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you have room to negotiate further, potentially reaching a price closer to your desired value.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  The actual negotiation strategy will depend on how Bob reacts to your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a substantial amount, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Maintain your leverage:** Show Bob that you're not desperate to sell at his proposed price.
* **Potentially secure a better deal:** You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price of $1,400,000.
* **Avoid settling too low:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is your safety net, but it's still lower than what Bob is willing to pay. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, you have the opportunity to achieve a better outcome for yourself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer offers a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It's a clear signal that you're not willing to accept his initial price.
* **Lower than your initial offer:**  It demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** It secures a profit of $300,000 for you, which is still very good.

This counteroffer puts the ball back in Bob's court. It's likely he'll either accept this compromise or come back with a counteroffer closer to your initial price."
