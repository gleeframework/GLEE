Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that considers its value to me."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my current budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? That's the absolute maximum I can offer at this time."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is the maximum you can offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to go as low as $8,000. You've already stated that's your maximum budget. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than risk Alice not budging further and losing the deal."
