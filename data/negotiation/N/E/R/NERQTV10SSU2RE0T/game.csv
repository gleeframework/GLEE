,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $165?  Let me know what you think.",165.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $165. Let's see if we can close the deal.",165.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your guns at $165, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $170? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $170 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $167.50. It's closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",167.5,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I see you're getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll try to meet you halfway from $170. How about we try $168? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to get a deal done.",168.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $168 is still too high. Let's meet at $166.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",166.5,Bob,8,
