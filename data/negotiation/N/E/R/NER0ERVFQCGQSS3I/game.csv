"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1075000.  This offer is close to my maximum, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $1075000, but I'm still not ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1090000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really pushing the limits here, but I can offer $1060000.  This is my absolute final offer, let's see if we can make this work.",1060000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not willing to accept $1060000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my initial asking price.
