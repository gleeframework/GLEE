Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a good price for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm still aiming to maximize my profit. This counteroffer is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing time and potentially ending up with a price I'm not happy with. Selling to John for $120 is the best option for me at this point."
