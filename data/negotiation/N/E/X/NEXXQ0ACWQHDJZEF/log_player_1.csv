Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Is below your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **Is close to your desired price:** This gives you the best chance of getting a price you're happy with.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. If he rejects your initial offer, you can decide whether to lower your price, make a counteroffer, or simply sell to John."
