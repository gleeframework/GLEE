"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $9,500 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is asking for $9,500. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can try to get a better price by counteroffering.
* **You're not desperate.** You have the option to buy from John, so you're not under pressure to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. How about we start at $9,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $9,250? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While closer to your limit, $9,250 is still above your desired price point. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can likely get the price down further by counteroffering.
* **You still have the option of John.** You're not forced to accept a price you're not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $9,100. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it will work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9100}
