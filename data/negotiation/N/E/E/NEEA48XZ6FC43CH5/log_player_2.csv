Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and encourages further negotiation. $900,000 is still within Bob's budget, and it leaves room for Alice to come down a bit."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal but still has some room to negotiate. He's still within his budget and has a few more rounds to try and get an even lower price.  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and with a few rounds left, it's worth pushing for a slightly lower price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push.  This offer is very close to Alice's latest price, showing that he is serious about finalizing a deal.

He is betting that Alice will be willing to accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal altogether."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's the final round, and Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, there's a real risk that Alice will reject Bob's final counteroffer, leaving him with no deal.

Given this uncertainty, and the fact that Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, it's the most prudent decision to purchase the product from John for $800,000. This ensures Bob gets the product while staying within his budget and avoiding any further risk of negotiation failure."
