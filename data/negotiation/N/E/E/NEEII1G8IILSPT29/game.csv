"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This would still allow me to make a profit while giving you a good deal.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you meet me in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  How about $8,000? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
