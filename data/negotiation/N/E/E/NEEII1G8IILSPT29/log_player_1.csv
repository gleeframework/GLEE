"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to build rapport with Bob and highlight the potential benefits of the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** This price gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm aware of John's offer and will be willing to walk away if negotiations with Bob don't get me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I still have several rounds to negotiate and I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John's offer provides me with the security to be firm in my negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This would still allow me to make a profit while giving you a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round, but still keeping it above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential value of the product to him, framing the price as a good deal. 
* **Positive and open communication:** I'm using a friendly tone to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Still within my range:** This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and is well above my minimum acceptable price, leaving me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you meet me in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is moving:** I see a pattern of Bob coming closer to my price point with each round. I believe I can still get a better deal.
* **John's offer provides a strong fallback:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  How about $8,000? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.  
* **Maintaining my profit margin:**  $8,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Building on the momentum:** I'm hoping this slight concession will lead to a deal in the next round."
