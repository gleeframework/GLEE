"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my organization. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your business, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value this product represents to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing $950,000 as a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my organization. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
