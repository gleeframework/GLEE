{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it will be even more valuable to your organization.  My initial offer is $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my organization. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. I'll reject his offer and see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your business, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value this product represents to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing $950,000 as a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my organization. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a price closer to $950,000, accepting Bob's offer of $925,000 is still a good outcome.  It's significantly higher than selling to John and leaves me with a decent profit."
