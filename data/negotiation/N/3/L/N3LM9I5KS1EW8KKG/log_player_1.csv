"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500, given your stated value for the product. This is a fair price considering we're both looking for a win-win. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  I can see we both want to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $7,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is my final offer, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  How about $8,000 even? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer of $8,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me.  I've already rejected his previous offer and made a counteroffer, so it seems like we've reached an agreement. It's also a good strategy to avoid taking the risk of going through more rounds and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob or even having to sell to John for $8,000."
