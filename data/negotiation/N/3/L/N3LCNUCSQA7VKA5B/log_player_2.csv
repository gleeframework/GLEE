{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay.  It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm also willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'll see how Alice responds to this first counteroffer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I'm still not ready to accept. There's room for further negotiation, and I want to try to bring the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'm aiming for a price that's a good compromise between what I'm willing to pay and what Alice might be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my target price. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of reaching a stalemate or Alice walking away from the deal is increasing. It's more beneficial to accept this offer and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
