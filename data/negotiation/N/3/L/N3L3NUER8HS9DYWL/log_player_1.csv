{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and still make a profit. I'm also being friendly and encouraging a conversation, which may make Bob more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'd like to get for the product. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll let you have it for $9,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm also being friendly and appealing to the idea of a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is persistent with his offer of $9,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than $9,500. To avoid further negotiation and ensure a reasonable profit, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
