Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has indicated that she won't go lower than $1,100,000. Since I can get the product from John for $800,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and avoid any further negotiation."
