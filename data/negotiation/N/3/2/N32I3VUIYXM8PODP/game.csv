"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still allows me to cover my costs and ensures a fair value for the product. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
