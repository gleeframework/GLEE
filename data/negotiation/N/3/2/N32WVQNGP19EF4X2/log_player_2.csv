"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $80. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it.  However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $85 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $87? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. Alice has come down from $90 to $87, which is a good price for you, and still a decent profit for Alice. You're only paying $7 more than Alice's minimum selling price, and you're saving $13 compared to buying from John."
