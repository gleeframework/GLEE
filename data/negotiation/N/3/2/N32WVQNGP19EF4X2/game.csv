"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it.  However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $85 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $87? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",87.0,Alice,3,
