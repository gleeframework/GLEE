Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to me, so I cannot accept Bob's offer of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $110? That would still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to propose $105 as my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for $105. It's better to continue negotiating and see if I can push for a higher price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $107.50?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer of $106 is close enough to my desired price point, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting his offer is the best decision to maximize my profit in this scenario."
