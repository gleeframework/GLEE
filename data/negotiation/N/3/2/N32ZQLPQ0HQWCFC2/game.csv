,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,400,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
