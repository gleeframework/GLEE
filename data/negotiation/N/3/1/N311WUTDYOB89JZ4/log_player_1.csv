Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $120 to Bob. This is valuable information.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you could start higher, a price of $100 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Significant Profit Margin:** This price point ensures you make a $20 profit even if Bob negotiates down a bit.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer is significantly above your minimum selling price ($80 to John), giving you a good safety net. 

By starting at $100, you strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring the offer is appealing enough for Bob to accept."
