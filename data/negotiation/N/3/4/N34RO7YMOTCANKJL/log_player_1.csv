""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  While I have other interested parties willing to pay top dollar, I believe this product would be uniquely valuable to you. I'm willing to make this a smooth transaction and forgo a bidding war, but I need your answer soon. How about a price of $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) without going below our guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000).
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers, we incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering a price of $1,100,000 gives Bob a $100,000 discount (making it very attractive) while still earning Alice $100,000 more than selling to John."
