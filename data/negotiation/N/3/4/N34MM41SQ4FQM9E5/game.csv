"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a good home for the product, $12,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
