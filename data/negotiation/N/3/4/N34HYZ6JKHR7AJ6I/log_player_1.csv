"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but also leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 at this point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's my minimum acceptable price, and it's good to close the deal.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
