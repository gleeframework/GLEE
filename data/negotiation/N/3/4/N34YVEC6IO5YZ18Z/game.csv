"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects the true value of this unique product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,075,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
