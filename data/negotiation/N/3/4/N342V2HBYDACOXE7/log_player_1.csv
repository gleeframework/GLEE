"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000.  I think it's a fair price, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Could you do $17,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $11,500? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, it seems like we are getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This is a very fair offer considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I could make a final offer of $12,000. That's my limit, and I think it's a fair price considering John is also offering at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is aware that John is offering $15,000 and is using this as leverage. It's unlikely Bob will go higher than $12,000. Accepting a lower price than what John offers makes no sense in this scenario."
