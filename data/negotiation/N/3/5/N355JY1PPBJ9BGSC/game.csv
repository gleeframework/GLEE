"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $1,150,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a reasonable price that's closer to my budget and reflects the product's value. Let's try to bridge the gap.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit away from my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,087,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it allows us to move forward. Let's close this deal.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
