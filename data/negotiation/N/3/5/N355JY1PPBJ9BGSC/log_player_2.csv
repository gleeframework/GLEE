"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $1,150,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down further. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob. There is still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to lower the price.  He can afford to reject this offer and continue negotiating. There are still 7 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a reasonable price that's closer to my budget and reflects the product's value. Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit away from my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,087,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it allows us to move forward. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and they're now only $37,500 apart. 
* **Time:**  There are only 5 rounds remaining.  If Bob rejects this offer and continues to negotiate, there's a risk that the deal will fall through, and he'll have to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Value:** $1,087,500 is still within Bob's budget and represents a good saving compared to John's offer. 

While Bob might prefer a lower price, accepting this offer ensures he gets the product at a reasonable cost and avoids the risk of a higher price or no deal."
