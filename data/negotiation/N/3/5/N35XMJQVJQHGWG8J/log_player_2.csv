"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While $100 is lower than Alice's value, it's still significantly higher than my $80 limit and what John offers. I should try negotiating a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

Reason: I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, aiming for a price closer to my $80 limit. This gives room for negotiation while signaling I'm serious about buying but need a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $65 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $85 is my absolute minimum.  This is still a great deal for you, and I hope you'll reconsider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  Alice has come down to $85, which is only slightly above my $80 limit and John's price.  Further haggling might not yield a better result, and I risk her withdrawing the offer altogether. It's a good price and worth accepting."
