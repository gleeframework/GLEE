"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $11,500 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.

You should reject Alice's offer again. While she is coming down in price, it is still above your budget. You should try to negotiate with Alice again to see if you can get closer to your ideal price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm proposing a price of $12,250 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.

Alice's offer is still higher than your budget.  You've reached a point where it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $10,000, rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
