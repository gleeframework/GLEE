"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's my absolute limit. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal compared to the original price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm seeing we're not quite meeting in the middle. I really want this product, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a final offer, as I'm happy to go with John for $800,000 if we can't find an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,025,000.
