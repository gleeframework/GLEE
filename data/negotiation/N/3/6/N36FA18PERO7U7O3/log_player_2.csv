"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $115.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to save as much money as I can. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, I'm not sure if $115 is a good deal for me. I'll reject Alice's offer for now and see if I can find a better deal.
