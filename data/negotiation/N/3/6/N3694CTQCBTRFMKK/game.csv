"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900000 is significantly below my minimum price.  I'm prepared to come down to $1100000. This reflects a considerable discount from my initial offer and still allows you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

If you're not able to meet that price, I'll be moving on to other buyers.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
