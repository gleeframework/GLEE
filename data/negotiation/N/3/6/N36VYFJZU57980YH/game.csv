"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. My initial offer is $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated, and it gives me some breathing room. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $975,000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, but it's a bit more aligned with what I'm comfortable paying. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer, but I need to see $1,012,500. This price is a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but $1,012,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $990,000. This price is a compromise, but it's still within my comfort zone. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $990,000 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to make one final concession, but it needs to be at least $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise given our back-and-forth, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $980,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. Let's see if we can make a deal.",980000.0,Bob,8,
