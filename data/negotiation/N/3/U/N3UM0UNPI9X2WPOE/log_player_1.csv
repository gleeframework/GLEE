Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $950,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for a product of this value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

We're still too far below the product's value and what John is offering. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so we can try pushing him a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $1,125,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $1,075,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for a product of this value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

Bob is now very close to our minimum acceptable price and John's offer. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him lowering his offer in subsequent rounds and ensures a profit above our guaranteed alternative."
