"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $10,500.  Would that be something you'd consider?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. To be honest, $11,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're willing to make this work, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,
