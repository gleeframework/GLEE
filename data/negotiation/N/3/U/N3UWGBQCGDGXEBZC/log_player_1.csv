I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a good starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if necessary. I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my desired $1,500,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept his offer and get something, I'm confident I can do better.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,600,000. This is still significantly more than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's a step closer to my target price and demonstrates my willingness to compromise."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm getting closer to his desired price. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to come up a bit more."

Bob's offer is still not acceptable, and I'm running out of time to get a better price. I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,500,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and allows me to move on."
