"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",75.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $85, Bob. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $82?",82.0,Alice,5,
