Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price considering its value and the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
