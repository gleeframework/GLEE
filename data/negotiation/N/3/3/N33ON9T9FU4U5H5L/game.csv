"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but my initial price was based on a deeper understanding of this product's potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
