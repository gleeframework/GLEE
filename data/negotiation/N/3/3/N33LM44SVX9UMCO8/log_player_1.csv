Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still being a significant profit over my minimum value.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if I feel like I'm not getting a good deal from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can do better.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully a more reasonable price for Bob.  It also gives me some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $11,000 is a good price, and I'm happy with the profit margin.  While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely, and I'm not sure I'd get a better offer from him.  Selling to John for $10,000 is also an option, but getting $1,000 more from Bob is worth it."
