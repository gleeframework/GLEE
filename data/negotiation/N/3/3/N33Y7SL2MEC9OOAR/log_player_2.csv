"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $900,000. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, so this is a significant opportunity to acquire it at a fair price. Consider this: if you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $1,000,000. This is your chance to secure it at a lower price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
