Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($120) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.  Offering it slightly below my minimum gives him a perceived ""deal"" and increases the chance he'll accept. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives me leverage. I don't need to go below $119."
