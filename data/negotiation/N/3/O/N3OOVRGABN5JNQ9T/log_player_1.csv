"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration of its value, I'm pleased to offer it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit.
* **Justification:** I've framed the price as reflecting the ""true worth and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth even more in the right hands. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My tone is polite and encourages Bob's feedback, indicating my willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the option of accepting John's offer ($1,500,000) if negotiations falter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his initial perception of the product's value, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, I'm aiming for something closer to $2,100,000. I'm confident this price point accurately reflects its potential for generating significant returns.  Are you open to discussing this further?"",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my asking price by $100,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate and meet Bob partway.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm holding firm well above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's initial offer ($1,800,000). My goal is to maximize profit while keeping the negotiation moving. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's ""potential for generating significant returns"" to justify the higher price and appeal to Bob's desire for a worthwhile investment.
* **Open to Dialogue:** The tone remains collaborative and open to further discussion, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below both my previous asking price and, more importantly, my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. His statement that this is his ""highest"" offer suggests he's unlikely to move significantly closer to my desired range.  

It's now more beneficial to cut my losses and accept John's standing offer of $1,500,000. This guarantees I achieve my minimum acceptable profit and avoids the risk of further lowball offers from Bob."
