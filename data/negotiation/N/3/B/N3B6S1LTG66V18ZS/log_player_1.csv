Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable.  I'll see if he's willing to negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $11,500 is below my minimum price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still a little higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully find a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer."
