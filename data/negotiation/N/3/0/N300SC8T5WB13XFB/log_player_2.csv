Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a fair price, considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it could bring to your business. What do you think?

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $20,000 is above Bob's $15,000 limit.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
