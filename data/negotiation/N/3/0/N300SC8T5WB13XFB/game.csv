"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While $15000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $17500. This takes into account your budget and reflects my desire to reach an agreement. Let me know if this works for you.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $16000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",16000.0,Bob,4,
