"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for $12,000, so I have a safety net in case Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I can sell to John for $12,000, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $13,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a significant step down from my initial offer. I'm hoping that this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate and that we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not ready to settle for that price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again. Even though I can sell to John for $12,000, I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob. I have 6 rounds left, so there's still time to see if we can come to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $12,500. This is only $500 more than what I could get from John, and it's a significant step down from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it. I'm also considering that we only have 5 rounds left before I have to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offers have been consistently lower than my minimum price, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I've only got 4 rounds left, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. I'm confident that selling to John for $12,000 is the best option at this point."
