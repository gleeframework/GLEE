"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, and I always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is far too low.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still securing a decent profit."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm still confident I can get a good price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,450,000. This is a small concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. I want to see if we can reach an agreement before I have to consider selling to John."
