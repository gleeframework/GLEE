"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your position, but I still believe we can find common ground. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This allows us to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the item. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position and I'm willing to consider $10,700 as a fair price for the product. This allows us to stay within your comfort zone while also meeting my budget constraints. I hope this proposal works for you.",10700.0,Bob,6,
