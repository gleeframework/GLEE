"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,050,000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal finalized. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
