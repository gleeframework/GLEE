{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high but still leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. It also opens the door for Bob to make a counteroffer, giving you more information to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good amount of money, it's still lower than my desired price point. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing a final price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests. If this doesn't work, I will have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good deal, especially considering he's willing to pay significantly more than John.  It's time to secure the sale and move on."
