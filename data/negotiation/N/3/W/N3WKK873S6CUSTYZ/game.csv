,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm willing to pay.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing a final price of $1000000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests. If this doesn't work, I will have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account both our interests.",950000.0,Bob,4,
