"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm trying to be mindful of my budget, and I'm not sure if the product is worth the full $12,000 to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  This still allows you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for me.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
