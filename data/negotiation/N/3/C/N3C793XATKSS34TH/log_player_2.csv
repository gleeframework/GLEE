It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $12,000 is way over my budget of $8,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? "", ""product_price"": 8000}

$9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'll try to negotiate a bit further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Alice is still too high.  I'm close to my limit, but $9,250 is still too much. It's time to go with John."
