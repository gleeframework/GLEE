Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming to make more than $80, which is what John will pay.
* **Is lower than Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept. 

If Bob rejects, you can always fall back on John's offer."
