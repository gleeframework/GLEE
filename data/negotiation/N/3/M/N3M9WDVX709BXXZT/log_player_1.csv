"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $600,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm willing to take the risk of another round to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a substantial amount that reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle just yet. There's a chance I can get a better deal, and I'm not willing to give up on that potential. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm offering $850,000.  This is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and finally accept."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
