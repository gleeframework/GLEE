Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I believe it's a fantastic deal and will be valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) and even your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he immediately rejects it, you know he's very price-sensitive. If he counters, it suggests he's willing to negotiate. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you leverage. You can walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Maximum Offer:** Bob's offer of $150 matches the maximum he's willing to pay (his perceived value of the product). 
* **No Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves no room for you to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $150, which matches Bob's best offer.

Therefore, it makes the most sense to sell the product to John immediately at your desired minimum price."
