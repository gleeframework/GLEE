"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still beneficial for both of us. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your maximum price:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

Since you can get the product from John for the same price as Alice's offer, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John. This is because you have no incentive to accept a price that is the same as your alternative option."
