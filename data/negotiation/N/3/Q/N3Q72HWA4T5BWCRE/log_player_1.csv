Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** At $130, Bob is still getting a decent deal, even though it's above his perceived value of $80.
* **It's below your minimum:** It allows you to negotiate downwards if needed, while still staying above your minimum of $150.
* **It's open-ended:** The message encourages Bob to respond and start a negotiation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and engaging Bob in a negotiation, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'd rather secure the guaranteed sale to John at $150, ensuring I meet my minimum profit goal."
