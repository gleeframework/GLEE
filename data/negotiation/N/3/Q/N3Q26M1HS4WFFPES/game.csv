,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my maximum limit is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me. Please consider it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is too low for what this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value and potential this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and reflects the product's value. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is close, but I need to get at least $1,600,000 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
