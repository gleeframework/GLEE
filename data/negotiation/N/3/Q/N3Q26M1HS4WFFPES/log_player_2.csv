Alice's offer is way too high, even considering the potential value to her. It's best to start negotiating to see if we can reach a reasonable price."

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my budget. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is close, but I need to get at least $1,600,000 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still too high for me, even though it's getting closer to my budget. At this point, it's clear that negotiating with Alice won't get me the price I want.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $800,000.  It's a better deal for me, even though it means I might be missing out on some of the potential value Alice sees in the product."
