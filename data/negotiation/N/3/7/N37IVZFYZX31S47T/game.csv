"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're not wanting to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate further with you, but $135 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $142.50?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",142.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're getting closer. I could do $138, but that's the best I can offer.",138.0,Bob,6,
