"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price that allows you to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Even though Alice is offering a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can get the same product from John for a lower price."
