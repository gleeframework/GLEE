{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $10,000. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  This aggressive counteroffer helps establish Bob's negotiating stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still some room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving up slightly from his previous counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below Alice's $11,000 offer.  The counteroffer is still within Bob's budget, allowing him to potentially close the deal at a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is now very close to Bob's target price and within his budget.  While there's a slight chance Bob could negotiate a bit lower, the risk of Alice rejecting a further counteroffer and potentially moving closer to John's price makes this the most logical choice at this point. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
