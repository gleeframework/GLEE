Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so I'm offering a price that is a compromise. If he rejects, I'll have to decide if his counteroffer is worth it or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm willing to lower my price a bit more, but $9,500 is still a fair compromise.  It's closer to my minimum and allows for some room to negotiate.  I'm hoping this is appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low. I've already lowered my price twice, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's below my minimum. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the best option at this point."
