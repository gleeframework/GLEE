"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer,  $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm confident this product is worth the investment for you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",92.5,Bob,4,
