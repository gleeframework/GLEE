Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing our profit. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while having a safety net in John's guaranteed purchase."
