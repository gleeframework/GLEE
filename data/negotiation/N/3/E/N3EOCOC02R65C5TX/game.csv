"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I understand it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
