"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I understand it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is asking for $1,250,000, which is more than your maximum price and more than John's offer.  You can get a better deal by rejecting her offer. While Alice implies the product is worth $1,200,000 to both of you, you know John will sell it at that price."
