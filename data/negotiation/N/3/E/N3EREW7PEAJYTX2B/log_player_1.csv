I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I believe it's a fair starting point, considering the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's counteroffer is too low.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial price, it's clear we are too far apart.  I'm not comfortable going lower than $1,500,000, so I'll sell to John."
