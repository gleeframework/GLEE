You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming closer to your desired price, it's unlikely she'll go below $80.  You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no point in further negotiation."
