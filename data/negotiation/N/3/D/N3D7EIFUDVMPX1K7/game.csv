"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $105?  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a deal for $125. It's a great price for this product, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about $115?  That's closer to what I'm hoping to spend and a good middle ground for us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit higher than your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $122.50. It's a fair price for this product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $122.50 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford right now. How about we split the difference again and settle at $118.75?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to spend.  What do you say?",118.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $118.75 is still a bit higher than your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a deal for $119.00. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, and I think it's still a great value for you.",119.0,Alice,7,
