Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob a good reason to negotiate, but still leaves me some room to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to come down a bit,  $100 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
