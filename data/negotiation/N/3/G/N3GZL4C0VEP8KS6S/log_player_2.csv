"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to come down a bit,  $100 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That would be fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a better deal than John's $150.  While Bob might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or hold firm at $110. Accepting her offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
