Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to pay close to that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not the ideal price, it's still above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation. There's always a chance that Bob might reject a counteroffer, and I'd be left with the lower price from John."
