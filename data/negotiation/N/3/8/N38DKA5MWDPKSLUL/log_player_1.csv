Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. "",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $1,000,000 (your value) because you have John as a backup buyer.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you want to go as high as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still giving Bob a $150,000 incentive to buy from you instead of seeking alternative solutions (which might not even exist).

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's alternative options or negotiating tactics beyond his valuation of the product."
