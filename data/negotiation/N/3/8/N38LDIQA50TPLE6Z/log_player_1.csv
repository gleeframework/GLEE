Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts on this offer."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob.  
* **Perceived Value:**  The fact that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob suggests it might hold even greater subjective value for him.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,800,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price significantly higher than your fallback option.

**Important Note:**  This strategy is based on maximizing potential profit. It assumes Bob has a strong interest in the product and might be willing to pay a premium. If you want to prioritize a guaranteed sale, a lower starting price would be advisable."
