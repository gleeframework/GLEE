"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you do any better, perhaps closer to $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $70, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $100?",100.0,Alice,5,
