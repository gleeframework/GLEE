Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better offer from Bob.  We're above John's offer, and there's still room to negotiate."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not quite there. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $860,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the value you're placing on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000

While I'd like to push for more, Bob is clearly demonstrating price sensitivity around this point. Accepting his offer of $860,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
