{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $1,000,000, so $1,200,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You want $1,500,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards if needed. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to your target than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below your desired minimum.  

It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering our previous offers, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at a price that drastically undervalues the product. 
* **Is closer to your desired price:**  It bridges the gap between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it more likely to be accepted.

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1120000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to your desired price, $1,120,000 is still too far below your minimum.  It's more profitable to sell to John at this point and secure the $1,500,000.  Negotiating further with Bob risks going back and forth for a long time without getting significantly closer to your desired outcome."
