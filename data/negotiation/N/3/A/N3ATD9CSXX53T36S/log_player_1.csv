Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
