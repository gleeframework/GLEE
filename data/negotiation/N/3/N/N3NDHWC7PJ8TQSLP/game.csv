"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $950,000 and my original asking price is substantial. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let me propose a price of $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. However, my position hasn't changed. I need a minimum of $1,000,000 for this product. It's a fair and final offer considering its value. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
