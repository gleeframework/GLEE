"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussion. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you. I believe this represents a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price point acknowledges the product's worth while still offering you significant potential for return. Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 remains out of reach for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still leaves room for a profitable outcome for you. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
