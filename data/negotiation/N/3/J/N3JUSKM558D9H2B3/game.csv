"Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this transaction. Let's make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However,  $950,000 is still quite a bit below what I believe the product is worth, especially considering the benefits it offers you. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
