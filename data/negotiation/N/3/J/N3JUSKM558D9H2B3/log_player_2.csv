"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, so there's a significant gap.  Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this transaction. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However,  $950,000 is still quite a bit below what I believe the product is worth, especially considering the benefits it offers you. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  Buying from John would cost $1,200,000, so this is a better deal for Bob.  There's a chance Bob could negotiate a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John isn't worth it."
