Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $1,100,000, we anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than our minimum ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This opening price leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and inviting discussion.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this transaction. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant profit, it's still a substantial distance from Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation and the potential to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However,  $950,000 is still quite a bit below what I believe the product is worth, especially considering the benefits it offers you. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price while still advocating for a higher value. Justifying the price with the product's benefits reinforces its worth.
* **Strategic Midpoint:**  $1,025,000 is a strategic midpoint between the previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, encouraging movement from both sides.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  The language remains respectful and collaborative, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome."
