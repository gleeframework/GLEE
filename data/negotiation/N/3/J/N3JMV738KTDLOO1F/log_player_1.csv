Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's still significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
