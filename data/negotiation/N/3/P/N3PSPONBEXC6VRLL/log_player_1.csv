Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I could sell to John for $100, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $115. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more for my product."", ""product_price"": 107.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $105 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm confident that I can't get much more from Bob.  $105 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal."
