``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic, emphasizing mutual benefit. 
* **Strategy:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation while still securing a good profit.  This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,100,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  There's a chance he might raise his offer if he truly wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this deal work for me.  It reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's still a fair price for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm raising the price to $1,300,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price but a significant increase from Bob's offer.  
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and emphasizing the value of the product.  I'm also keeping the tone positive and collaborative to encourage further negotiation.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows I'm serious about negotiating while leaving room for compromise.  It's a calculated risk, but I believe Bob may be willing to move closer to my price to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer.  Considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with nothing, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice.  It secures a decent profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
