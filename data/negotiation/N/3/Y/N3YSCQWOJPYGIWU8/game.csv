"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,100,000. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this deal work for me.  It reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's still a fair price for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
