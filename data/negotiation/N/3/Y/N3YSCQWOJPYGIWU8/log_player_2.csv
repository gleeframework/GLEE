Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this deal work for me.  It reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's still a fair price for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.
