"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Buying from John saves you a significant amount of money ($400,000). There's no reason to pay more when you have a guaranteed lower price elsewhere."
