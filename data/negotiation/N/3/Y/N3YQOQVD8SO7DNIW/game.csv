"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to me from another seller. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've done some further research and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a more agreeable price. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the market value and my maximum budget. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the market demand.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
