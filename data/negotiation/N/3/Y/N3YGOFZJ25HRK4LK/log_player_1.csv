Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""excellent value,"" Alice subtly implies the price is justified without explicitly stating why. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests Alice is open to discussing the price further if Bob shows resistance.

While Alice knows she has John as a backup, she doesn't need to reveal that to Bob. Her goal is to get the best price possible from Bob first."
