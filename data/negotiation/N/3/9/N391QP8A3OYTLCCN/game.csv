"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13500. This represents a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14250. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me.",14250.0,Alice,7,
