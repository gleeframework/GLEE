Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's situation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm asking for $1,400,000, reflecting its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows John will buy the product for $1,500,000, so she has a strong fallback. Starting high gives her room to negotiate if needed.
* **Just below John's price:** This price is tantalizingly close to what John offers, creating a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, not just a raw price tag, aiming to justify the high ask. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:**  This offer assumes we don't know much about Bob's negotiation style. If Alice knew he was very price-sensitive, she might start lower.
* **Relationship:** If Alice wants a long-term relationship with Bob, a less aggressive opening might be better. 
* **Time constraints:**  If Alice needs to sell quickly, she might be more flexible on price."
