"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price that's fair to both of us.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.  What do you think about $10,000?  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly starting high. While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, you know you have a backup option with John.  By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal and she might come down in price."
