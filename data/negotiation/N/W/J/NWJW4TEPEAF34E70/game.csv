"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  Considering the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $8500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $8500 as a fair price.  I'm sure we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $9500.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10750. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $10750 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go with $10000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,8,
