{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you! I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $100 is more than your minimum of $80. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so there's room to negotiate a price that benefits both of you.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This message is friendly and professional, clearly stating the price and prompting Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to me, but I would like to propose a price of $85. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still try to get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to your desired $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $85 is a good starting point, I'm still looking to get closer to $95 for it. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence. Considering my budget constraints, I am willing to pay $90 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $80 and close to your desired $95. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
