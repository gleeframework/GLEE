,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, but I believe the product's value is higher than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Let me know if that's more in line with your budget.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1200000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm happy to compromise further and offer $950000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1025000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable with $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1075000. Let's see if we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
