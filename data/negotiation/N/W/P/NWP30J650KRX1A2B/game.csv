"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  I'm asking for $16,000 to start.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but could only go up to $8,000 at this time.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'd see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $14,000 is still outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for sticking with me.  I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I've been hoping to make a deal with you. How about we split the difference again and land at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for explaining the situation. I understand you have other offers, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but I need to be closer to my bottom line. I'm willing to let it go for $10,500. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision today.",10500.0,Alice,7,
