"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $600,000 is far too low for me to consider. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and it reflects the value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $825,000 is a good deal, especially considering the time constraints and the risk of losing out on a sale to John."
