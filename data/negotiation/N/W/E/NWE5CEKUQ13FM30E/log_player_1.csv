Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 14000}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $13,750. This way, we both get a fair price and can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure the sale than risk losing both Bob and John."
