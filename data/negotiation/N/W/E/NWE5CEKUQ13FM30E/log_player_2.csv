"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

I've started with a significantly lower offer to see how much negotiating room there is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down significantly, $14,000 is still more than John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

We're getting closer! I've proposed a price that's a compromise between her last offer and my previous one. Let's see if she's willing to go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $13,750. This way, we both get a fair price and can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but I think I can still negotiate a little bit more before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  How about we settle at $13,000?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

I'm getting close to my limit. I've proposed $13,000 and made it clear this is my final offer. This gives me some wiggle room if she counters, but also sets a firm boundary.  I need to be prepared to walk away if she doesn't accept."
