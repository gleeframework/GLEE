"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",160.0,Alice,3,
