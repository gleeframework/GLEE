Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but $1,650,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.

We're getting closer, but I still think we can get a better deal than $1,500,000.  It's time to push back a bit more firmly while still showing willingness to negotiate."

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still securing a profit of $350,000 over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now is generally better than risking further negotiation, especially with a strong offer on the table. 
* **Uncertainty of Further Negotiation:** There's no guarantee Bob would go higher, and we risk him walking away if we push too hard. 
 
Accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
