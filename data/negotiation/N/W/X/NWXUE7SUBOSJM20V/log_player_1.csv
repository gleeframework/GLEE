Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum value of $100.  I'm confident Bob will be interested, as the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum value of $100, and it's likely that further negotiation would only lead to a lower price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
