"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be a game-changer for your business. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, a price I believe reflects its true value.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal, but I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a fair offer, it's a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to finalize this deal. This price still reflects the product's exceptional value and potential for your business.  Let's find a way to make this work!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 still doesn't fully cover the unique value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects the value I see in securing a deal with you.  Let's find a way to close this deal and ensure both of us walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",975000.0,Bob,6,
