"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be a game-changer for your business. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, a price I believe reflects its true value.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal, but I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a fair offer, it's a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to finalize this deal. This price still reflects the product's exceptional value and potential for your business.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I believe I can still get a better offer from Bob, especially since he's already shown interest in the product. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 still doesn't fully cover the unique value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects the value I see in securing a deal with you.  Let's find a way to close this deal and ensure both of us walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I've already made significant compromises and I'm not sure there's much more room for negotiation.  

With only four rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that I'll be able to close a deal with Bob at my desired price.  

I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and I'll be able to secure a sale with him at my minimum price of $1,000,000.  It's the best option to guarantee a sale that meets my financial goals."
