"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than the product's worth to her, you can get a better deal from John. Rejecting this offer might push Alice to propose a lower price, and even if not, you have John as a backup option."
