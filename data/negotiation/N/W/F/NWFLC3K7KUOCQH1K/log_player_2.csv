"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget ($18,000 vs $10,000).  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise.  You're trying to meet in the middle between your budget and her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $12,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your price point, $16,000 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. You have more room to negotiate and should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer reiterates your previous stance and shows that you are firm on your price point.  You are willing to stay in the negotiation, but not budge on your price.  This can potentially push Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $12,000, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll offer you the product for $14,000. This is my final concession, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $14,000, that's still above your budget. You have a couple of options:

* **Reject and counter-offer:**  Try to meet in the middle, maybe with a counteroffer of $13,000.
* **Buy from John:**  You are getting close to your limit with Alice.  If you think she won't budge further, buying from John for $10,000 is a good alternative.

This round is a key decision point!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer $13,000. Let's see if we can finally agree on a price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her offer and your previous offer. It shows you are willing to negotiate and reach an agreement, but also stick to your budget.  This can be a strong strategy to finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to meet you at $13,000. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer. I'll meet you at $13,500. This is my final concession, so I hope we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above your budget.  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and you are getting closer to your limit with Alice.  Buying from John at $10,000 offers you the best value and allows you to close the deal without further negotiation."
