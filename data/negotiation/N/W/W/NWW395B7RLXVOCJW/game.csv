"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially setting the price at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price still reflects the significant value this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value to me, and it leaves some room for you to negotiate further.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
