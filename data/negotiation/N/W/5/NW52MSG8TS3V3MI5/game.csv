Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.,90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $87.50, which is closer to my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $87.50 is a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $91? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",91.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $91 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm ready to pay $89. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",89.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $89 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $1.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $89 and $91, which would be $90. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to reach a deal.",90.0,Alice,7,
