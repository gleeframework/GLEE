"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite & Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's position while clearly stating my target price.
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $11,000, there's a decent chance Alice will counter, allowing us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Alice came down $1,500. However, there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get the price closer to $11,500 before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Splitting the difference between her current offer ($12,500) and my previous offer ($11,000) is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is and if a price closer to $11,500 is realistic. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While I could continue negotiating, each round takes time. $12,000 is a reasonable price, and accepting now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations."
