"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $11,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting with a strong offer significantly above both our valuations. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a much higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. While I want to maximize profit, dragging this out for too long risks losing both Bob and John.  

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above both our valuations. 
* **Time constraint:**  I'm aware of the 10-round limit and the option to go with John, so I want to make a reasonable counteroffer to avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is a good outcome for me. Bob is moving closer to my valuation, and I'm still getting a profit above John's offer.
