"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and gives me a healthy profit.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
