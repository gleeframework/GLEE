{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  This is a fair price considering its potential benefits.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price above your minimum value, leaving room for potential compromise. The message emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price. While it's tempting to take $10,000, it's better to keep negotiating and see if you can get closer to your desired price.  You have a backup option with John, which gives you leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $17,000.  This price reflects the value I know this product can bring to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $12000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below your minimum price of $15,000.  While you could continue negotiating,  it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet your desired price point.  It's more advantageous to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring you get your minimum value and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
