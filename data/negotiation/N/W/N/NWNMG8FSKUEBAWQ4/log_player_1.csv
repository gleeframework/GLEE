"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profits, but also keep the deal alive with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low for me. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in easily. I believe this counteroffer will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit for me and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  It's important to secure a deal before potentially losing Bob's interest."
