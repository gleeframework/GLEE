Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""true worth,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level.
* **Open Communication:**  The tone is positive and invites Bob to share his perspective, fostering a collaborative atmosphere for negotiation.

By starting high, you leave space to gradually decrease the price while still staying well above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both your asking price and your minimum acceptable price. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:** You can reiterate the product's unique features and benefits that justify a higher price point.
* **Negotiate Strategically:** By countering, you signal your willingness to negotiate but also maintain a firm stance on your valuation.

You have a comfortable buffer with John's offer, so you can afford to engage in further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However,  the price you've proposed doesn't fully reflect the unique advantages this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,600,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Meeting Bob halfway between your initial offer and his counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Re-emphasizing the product's ""unique advantages"" reinforces its worth beyond Bob's initial assessment. 
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and acknowledging Bob's position encourages him to reciprocate with further negotiation.

This approach aims to keep Bob engaged while steering the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm thinking of a price around $1,000,000. Can we discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While he expresses a desire to continue negotiations, his price increases are relatively small and show reluctance to move closer to your valuation.

At this point, continuing negotiations with Bob presents these risks:

* **Lost Time:**  Further back-and-forth could be time-consuming with no guarantee of reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Lower Offers:**  Bob might continue to lowball, hoping you'll eventually concede to a price far below your minimum.

You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price. It makes the most business sense to take the sure thing and maximize your profit rather than risk losing time and potentially settling for a much lower price with Bob."
