"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However,  the price you've proposed doesn't fully reflect the unique advantages this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,600,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
