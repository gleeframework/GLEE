"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product could be valuable, $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to consider $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand this is a significant investment, but the value of this product will truly pay off for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price reflects the product's unique benefits and potential for your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant advantages, and I'm sure it will generate substantial returns for your business.
