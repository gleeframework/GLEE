"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go lower than $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal on this amazing product.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,250. This is my final offer, as I'm happy to purchase from John at that price if you're unwilling to compromise further.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John at $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,5,
