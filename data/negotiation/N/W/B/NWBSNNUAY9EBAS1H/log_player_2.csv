"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price significantly below its true worth. While I value it at $1,500,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a unique chance to secure a substantial asset at a discounted price. Consider this carefully, as I have other interested buyers ready to pay full value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
